<head>Oldport in winter.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>Our <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> life rushes by, in Oldport, as if we were all shot from the mouth of a cannon, and were endeavoring to exchange visiting-cards on the way. But in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, when the great hotels are closed, and the bronze dogs that guarded the portals of the <rs type="place">Ocean House</rs> are collected sadly in the music pavilion, nose to nose; when the last <num value="4">four</num>-in-hand has departed, and a man may drive a solitary horse on the avenue without a pang,--then we know that <quote>the season</quote> is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Winter is yet several months away, --months of the most delicious autumn weather that the <rs>American</rs> climate holds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>But to the human bird of passage all that is not summer is winter; and those who seek Oldport most eagerly <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> for <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> are often those who regard it as uninhabitable for the other <num value="10">ten</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The Persian poet Saadi says that in a certain region of <placeName key="tgn,7006651" n="1.000 3" reg="hayastan">Armenia</placeName>, where he travelled, people never died the natural death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>But once a year they met on a certain plain, and occupied themselves with recreation, in the midst of which individuals of every rank and age would suddenly stop, make a reverence to the west, and, setting out at full speed toward that part of the desert, be seen no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>It is quite in this fashion that guests disappear from Oldport when the season ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>They also are apt to go toward the west, but by steamboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It is pathetic, on occasion of each annual bereavement, to observe the wonted looks and language of despair among those who linger behind; and it needs some fortitude to think of spending the winter near such a Wharf of Sighs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>But we console ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Each season brings its own attractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In summer <num value="1">one</num> may relish what is new in Oldport, as the liveries, the incomes, the manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>There is often a delicious freshness about these exhibitions; it is a pleasure <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> to see some opulent citizen in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs n="kid gloves" type="product">kid gloves</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>His new-born splendor stands in such brilliant relief against the confirmed respectability of the <quote>Old stone <persName n="Mill,,,,," id="n0220.0001.00013.00001" reg="mostcommon:Mill,nomatch:0"><surname>Mill</surname></persName>,</quote> the only thing on the <rs>Atlantic</rs> shore which has had time to forget its birthday!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But in winter the Old Mill gives the tone to the society around it; we then bethink ourselves of the crown upon our <orgName n="Trinity Church" type="church">Trinity Church</orgName> steeple, and resolve that the courtesies of a bygone age shall yet linger here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Is there any other place in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> where gentlemen still take off their hats to <num value="1">one</num> another on the public promenade?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The hat is here what it still is in <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Southern Europe</placeName>,the lineal successor of the sword as the mark of a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is noticed that, in going from Oldport to New York or <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> is liable to be betrayed by an over-flourish of the hat, as is an Arkansas man by a display of the bowie-knife.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Winter also imparts to these spacious estates a dignity that is sometimes wanting in summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I like to stroll over them during this epoch of desertion, just as once, when I happened to hold the keys of a church, it seemed pleasant to sit, on a week-day, among its empty pews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The silent <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> walls appeared to hold the pure essence of the prayers of a generation, while the routine and the ennui had vanished all away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><num value="1">One</num> may here do the same with fashion as there with devotion, extracting its finer flavors, if such there be, unalloyed by vulgarity or sin. In the winter I can fancy these fine houses tenanted by a true nobility; all the sons are brave, and all the daughters virtuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>These balconies have heard the sighs of passion without selfishness; those cedarn alleys have admitted only vows that were never broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If the occupant of the house be unknown, even by name, so much the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>And from homes more familiar, what lovely childish faces seem still to gaze from the doorways,--what graceful Absences (to borrow a certain poet's phrase) are haunting those windows!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There is a sense of winter quiet that makes a stranger soon feel at home in Oldport, while the prospective stir of next summer precludes all feeling of stagnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Commonly, in quiet places, <num value="1">one</num> suffers from the knowledge that everybody would prefer to be unquiet; but nobody has any such longing here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Doubtless there are aged persons who deplore the good old times when the <name>Oldport</name> <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> mail-bags were larger than those arriving at New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But if it were so now, what memories would there be to talk about?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If you wish for <quote><placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 10" reg="Suriyah,Asia">Syrian</placeName> peace, immortal leisure,</quote> --a place where no grown person ever walks rapidly along the street, and where few care enough for rain to open an umbrella or walk faster,--come here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>My abode is on a broad, sunny street, with a few great elms overhead, and with large old houses and grass-banks opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There is so little snow that the outlook in the depth of winter is often merely that of a paler and leafless summer, and a soft, springlike sky almost always spreads above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Past the window streams an endless sunny panorama (for the house fronts the chief thoroughfare between country and town),--relics of summer equipages in faded grandeur; great, fragrant haycarts; vast moving mounds of golden straw; loads of crimson onions; heaps of pale green cabbages; piles of gray tree-prunings, looking as if the patrician trees were sending their superfluous wealth of branches to enrich the impoverished orchards of the <rs type="place">Poor Farm</rs>; wagons of sea-weed just from the beach, with bright, moist <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> hues, and dripping with sea-water and sea-memories, each weed an argosy, bearing its own wild histories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At this season, the very houses move, and roll slowly by, looking round for more lucrative quarters next season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Never have I seen <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> made so transportable as in Oldport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The purchaser, after finishing and furnishing to his fancy, puts his name on the door, and on the fence a large white placard inscribed <quote>For sale.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Then his household arrangements are complete, and he can sit down to enjoy himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>By a side-glance from our window, <num value="1">one</num> may look down an ancient street, which in some early epoch of the world's freshness received the name of <address><street n="Spring Street">Spring Street</street></address>. A certain lively lady, addicted to daring Scriptural interpretations, thinks that there is some mistake in the current versions of Genesis, and that it was Spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Street which was created in the beginning, and the heavens and earth at some subsequent period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>There are houses in <address><street n="Spring Street">Spring Street</street></address>, and there is a confectioner's shop; but it is not often that a sound comes across its rugged pavements, save perchance</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>(in summer) the drone of an ancient hand-organ, <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> such as might have been devised by <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0220.0001.00017.00002" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName> to console his Eve when Paradise was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Yet of late the desecrating hammer and the ear-piercing saw have entered that haunt of ancient peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>May it be long ere any such invasion reaches those strange little wharves in the lower town, full of small, black, gambrel-roofed houses, with projecting eaves that might almost serve for piazzas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is possible for an unpainted wooden building to assume, in this climate, a more time-worn aspect than that of any stone; and on these wharves everything is so old, and yet so stunted, you might fancy that the houses had been sent down there to play during their childhood, and that nobody had ever remembered to fetch them back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The ancient aspect of things around us, joined with the softening influences of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream, imparts an air of chronic languor to the special types of society which here prevail in winter, as, for instance, people of leisure, trades-people living on their summer's gains, and, finally, fishermen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Those who pursue this last laborious calling are always lazy to the eye, for they are on shore only in lazy moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They work by night <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> or at early dawn, and by day they perhaps lie about on the rocks, or sit upon <num value="1">one</num> heel beside a fish-house door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I knew a missionary who resigned his post at the <rs>Isles</rs> of Shoals because it was impossible to keep the <name>Sunday</name> worshippers from lying at full length on the seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Our boatmen have the same habit, and there is a certain dreaminess about them, in whatever posture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Indeed, they remind <num value="1">one</num> quite closely of the <name n="Deutschland">German</name> boatman in <persName n="Uhland,,,,," id="n0220.0001.00018.00003" reg="mostcommon:Uhland,nomatch:0"><surname>Uhland</surname></persName>, who carried his reveries so far as to accept <num value="3">three</num> fees from <num value="1">one</num> passenger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But the truth is, that in Oldport we all incline to the attitude of repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Now and then a man comes here, from farther east, with the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> fever in his blood, and with a pestilent desire to do something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>You hear of him, presently, proposing that the <rs type="place">Town</rs> <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n0220.0001.00018.00004" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName> should be repainted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Opposition would require too much effort, and the thing is done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream soon takes its revenge on the intruder, and gradually repaints him also, with its own soft and mellow tints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In a few years he would no more bestir himself to fight for a change than to fight against it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It makes us smile a little, therefore, to observe <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> that universal delusion among the summer visitors, that we spend all winter in active preparations for next season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Not so; we all devote it solely to meditations on the season past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I observe that nobody in Oldport ever believes in any coming summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Perhaps the tide is turned, we think, and people will go somewhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>You do not find us altering our houses in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, or building out new piazzas even in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We wait till the people have actually come to occupy them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The preparation for visitors is made after the visitors have arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>This may not be the way in which things are done in what are called <quote>smart business places.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>But it is our way in Oldport.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It is another delusion to suppose that we are bored by this long epoch of inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Not at all; we enjoy it. If you enter a shop in winter, you will find everybody rejoiced to see you &mdash; as a friend; but if it turns out that you have come as a customer, people will look a little disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It is rather inconsiderate of you to make such demands out of season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Winter is not exactly the time for that sort of thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It seems rather to <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> violate the conditions of the truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Could you not postpone the affair till next <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Every country has its customs; I observe that in some places, New York for instance, the shopkeepers seem rather to enjoy a <quote>field-day</quote> when the sun and the customers are out. In Oldport, on the contrary, men's spirits droop at such times, and they go through their business sadly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>They force themselves to it during the summer, perhaps,for <num value="1">one</num> must make some sacrifices,--but in winter it is inappropriate as strawberries and cream.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The same spirit of repose pervades the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Nobody ever looks in a hurry, or as if an hour's delay would affect the thing in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The nearest approach to a mob is when some stranger, thinking himself late for the train (as if the thing were possible), is tempted to run a few steps along the sidewalk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>On such an occasion I have seen doors open, and heads thrust out. But ordinarily even the physicians drive slowly, as if they wished to disguise their profession, or to soothe the nerves of some patient who may be gazing from a window.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Yet they are not to be censured, since Death, <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> their antagonist, here drives slowly too. The number of the aged among us is surprising, and explains some phenomena otherwise strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>You will notice, for instance, that there are no posts before the houses in Oldport to which horses may be tied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Fashionable visitors might infer that every horse is supposed to be attended by a groom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Yet the tradition is, that there were once as many posts here as elsewhere, but that they were removed to get rid of the multitude of old men who leaned all day against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It obstructed the passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>And these aged citizens, while permitted to linger at their posts, were gossiping about men still older, in earthly or heavenly habitations, and the sensation of longevity went on accumulating indefinitely in their talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Their very disputes had a flavor of antiquity, and involved the reputation of female relatives to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> or <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>An old fisherman testified in our <orgName n="Police Court" type="court">Police Court</orgName>, the other day, in narrating the progress of a street quarrel: <quote>Then I called him <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Carter,,Polly,,," id="n0220.0001.00021.00005" reg="default:Carter,Polly,,,"><foreName>Polly</foreName> <surname>Carter</surname></persName>,</q> --that's his grandmother; and he called me <q direct="unspecified"> <persName n="Reynolds,,Susy,,," id="n0220.0001.00021.00006" reg="default:Reynolds,Susy,,,"><foreName>Susy</foreName> <surname>Reynolds</surname></persName>,</q> that's my aunt that's dead and gone.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/><pb id="p.22" n="22"/></p> 
<p>In towns like this, from which the young men mostly migrate, the work of life devolves upon the venerable and the very young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came to Oldport, it appeared to me that every insituation was conducted by a boy and his grandfather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>This seemed the cape, for instance, with the bank that consented to assume the slender responsibility of my deposits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It was further to be observed, that, if the elder official was absent for a day, the boy carried on the proceedings unaided; while if the boy also wished to amuse himself elsewhere, a worthy neighbor from across the way came in to fill the places of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Seeing this, I retained my small hold upon the concern with fresh tenacity; for who knew but some day, when the directors also had gone on a picnic, the senior depositor might take his turn at the helm?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It may savor of self-confidence, but it has always seemed to me, that, with <num value="1">one</num> day's control of a bank, even in these degenerate times, something might be done which would quite astonish the stockholders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Longer acquaintance has, however, revealed the fact, that these Oldport institutions stand out as <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> models of strict discipline beside their suburban compeers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>A friend of mine declares that he went lately into a country bank, near by, and found no <num value="1">one</num> on duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Being of opinion that there should always be some <num value="1">one</num> behind the counter of a bank, he went there himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Wishing to be informed as to the resources of his establishment, he explored desks and vaults, found a good deal of paper of different kinds, and some rich veins of copper, but no cashier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Going to the door again in some anxiety, he encountered a casual school-boy, who kindly told him that he did not know where the financial officer might be at the precise moment of inquiry, but that half an hour before he was on the wharf, fishing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Death comes to the aged at last, however, even in Oldport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>We have lately lost, for instance, that patient old postman, serenest among our human antiquities, whose deliberate tread might have imparted a tone of repose to <persName n="Broadway,,,,," id="n0220.0001.00023.00007" reg="mostcommon:Broadway,nomatch:0"><surname>Broadway</surname></persName>, could any imagination have transferred him thither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Through him the correspondence of other days came softened of all immediate solicitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Ere it reached you, friends had died or recovered, <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> debtors had repented, creditors grown kind, or your children had paid your debts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Perils had passed, hopes were chastened, and the most eager expectant took calmly the missive from that tranquillizing hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Meeting his friends and clients with a step so slow that it did not even stop rapidly, he, like <persName n="Tennyson,,,,," id="n0220.0001.00024.00008" reg="mostcommon:Tennyson,nomatch:0"><surname>Tennyson</surname></persName>'s Mariana, slowly <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/></p><l>From <hi rend="italics">his</hi> bosom drew</l> <l>Old letters.</l></quote> But a summons came at last, not to be postponed even by him. <num value="1">One</num> day he delivered his mail as usual, with no undue precipitation; on the next, the blameless soul was himself taken and forwarded on some celestial route.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Irreparable would have seemed his loss, did there not still linger among us certain types of human antiquity that might seem to disprove the fabled youth of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/><num value="1">One</num> veteran I daily meet, of uncertain age, perhaps, but with at least that air of brevet antiquity which long years of unruffled indolence can give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>He looks as if he had spent at least half a lifetime on the sunny slope of some beach, and the other half in leaning upon his elbows at the window of some sailor <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> boarding-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He is hale and broad, with a head sunk between <num value="2">two</num> strong shoulders; his beard falls like snow upon his breast, longer and longer each year, while his slumberous thoughts seem to move slowly enough to watch it as it grows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>I always fancy that these meditations have drifted far astern of the times, but are following after, in patient hopelessness, as a dog swims behind a boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>What knows he of the <rs>President</rs>'s Message?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>He has just overtaken some remarkable catch of mackerel in the year <dateStruct value="38"><year reg="38">thirty-eight</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>His hands lie buried fathom-deep in his pockets, as if part of his brain lay there to be rummaged; and he sucks at his old pipe as if his head, like other venerable hulks, must be smoked out at intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>His walk is that of a sloth, <num value="1">one</num> foot dragging heavily behind the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>I meet him as I go to the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, and on returning, <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> later, I pass him again, a little farther advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>All the children accost him, and I have seen him stop &mdash; no great retardation indeed &mdash; to fondle in his arms a puppy or a kitten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Yet he is liable to excitement, in his way; for once, in some high debate, wherein he <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> assisted as listener, when <num value="1">one</num> old man on a wharf was doubting the assertion of another old man about a certain equinoctial gale, I saw my friend draw his right hand slowly and painfully from his pocket, and let it fall by his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It was really <num value="1">one</num> of the most emphatic gesticulations I ever saw, and tended obviously to quell the rising discord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>It was as if the herald at a tournament had dropped his truncheon, and the fray must end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Women's faces are apt to take from old age a finer touch than those of men, and poverty does not interfere with this, where there is no actual exposure to the elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>From the windows of these old houses there often look forth delicate, faded countenances, to which belongs an air of unmistakable refinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Nowhere in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, I fancy, does <num value="1">one</num> see such counterparts of the reduced gentlewoman of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,--as described, for instance, in <quote><persName n="Cranford,,,,," id="n0220.0001.00026.00009" reg="mostcommon:Cranford,nomatch:0"><surname>Cranford</surname></persName>,</quote> --quiet maiden ladies of <num value="70">seventy</num>, with perhaps a tradition of beauty and bellehood, and still wearing always a bit of blue ribbon on their once golden curls,--this headdress being still carefully arranged, each day, by some handmaiden of <num value="60">sixty</num>, so long a house-mate <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> as to seem a sister, though some faint suggestion of wages and subordination may be still preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Among these ladies, as in <quote><persName n="Cranford,,,,," id="n0220.0001.00027.00010" reg="mostcommon:Cranford,nomatch:0"><surname>Cranford</surname></persName>,</quote> there is a dignified reticence in respect to money-matters, and a courteous blindness to the small economies practised by each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>It is not held good-breeding, when they meet in a shop of a morning, for <num value="1">one</num> to seem to notice what another buys.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> who comes to a wharf feels an impulse to follow it down, and look from the end. There is a fascination about it. It is the point of contact between land and sea. A bridge evades the water, and unites land with land, as if there were no obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>But a wharf seeks the water, and grasps it with a solid hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>It is the sign of a lasting friendship; once extended, there it remains; the water embraces it, takes it into its tumultuous bosom at high tide, leaves it in peace at ebb, rushes back to it eagerly again, plays with it in sunshine, surges round it in storm, almost crushing the massive thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>But the pledge once given is never withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Buildings may rise and fall, but a solid wharf is almost indestructible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>How softly and eagerly this coming tide swirls round them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>All day the fishes haunt their shadows; all night the phosphorescent water glimmers by them, and washes with long, refluent waves along their sides, decking their blackness with a spray of stars.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The sun always seems to shine in a ship-yard; there are apt to be more loungers than laborers, and this gives a pleasant air of repose; the neighboring water softens all harsher sounds, the foot treads upon an elastic carpet of embedded chips, and pleasant resinous odors are in the air.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Then there are wharves quite abandoned by commerce, and given over to small tenements, filled with families so abundant that they might dispel the fears of those alarmists who suspect that children are ceasing to be born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Shrill voices resound there--American or <persName n="Irish,,,,," id="n0220.0002.00044.00022" reg="mostcommon:Irish,nomatch:0"><surname>Irish</surname></persName>, as the case may be-through the summer noontides; and the domestic clothes-line forever stretches across the paths where imported slaves once trod, or rich merchandise lay piled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Some of these abodes are nestled in the corners of houses once stately, with large windows and carven doorways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Others occupy separate buildings, almost always of black, unpainted wood, sometimes with the long, sloping roof of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, oftener with the <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> quaint <quote>gambrel</quote> of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Some of the more secluded wharves appear wholly deserted by men and women, and are tenanted alone by rats and boys,--<num value="2">two</num> amphibious races; either can swim anywhere, or scramble and penetrate everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The boys launch some abandoned skiff, and, with an oar for a sail and another for a rudder, pass from wharf to wharf; nor would it be surprising if the bright-eyed rats were to take similar passage on a shingle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>You will see its brick tower rising not ungracefully, as you enter the inner harbor; it looks the better for being almost windowless, though beauty was not the aim of the omission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The ancient aspect of these wharves extends itself sometimes to the vessels which lie moored beside them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>At yonder pier, for instance, has lain for <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> a decaying bark, which was suspected of being engaged in the slave-trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>She lies chained at the wharf, and the tide rises and falls within her, thus furnishing a convenient bathing-house for the children, who also find a perpetual gymnasium in the broken shrouds that dangle from her masts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>There is no name upon the stern, and it exhibits merely a carved eagle, with the wings clipped and the head knocked off. Only the lower masts remain, which are of a dismal black, as are the tops and mizzen cross-trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Within the bulwarks, on each side, stand rows of black blocks, to which the shrouds were once attached; these blocks are called by sailors <quote>dead-eyes,</quote> and each stands in weird mockery, with its <num value="3">three</num> ominous holes, like so many human skulls before some palace in <placeName key="tgn,1000160" n="1.000 1" reg="benin">Dahomey</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Other blocks like these swing more ominously yet at the ends of the shrouds, that still hang suspended, waving and creaking and jostling <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> in the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Each year the ropes decay, and soon the repulsive pendants will be gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Not so with the iron belaying-pins, a few of which still stand around the mast, so rusted into the iron fife-rail that even the persevering industry of the children cannot wrench them out.

By <num value="1">one</num> of those fitnesses which fortune often adjusts, but which seem incredible in art, the wharf is now used on <num value="1">one</num> side for the storage of slate, and the hulk is approached through an avenue of gravestones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Once the court end of the town, then its commercial centre, it is now <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> divided between the tenements of fishermen and the summer homes of city households.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Still another lover was forced into a vessel by his friends, to <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> tear him from the enchanted neighborhood; while sailing past the house, he suddenly threw himself into the water,--it must have been about where the end of the wharf now rests,--that he might be rescued, and carried, a passive <persName n="Leander,,,,," id="n0220.0002.00051.00025" reg="mostcommon:Leander,nomatch:0"><surname>Leander</surname></persName>, into yonder door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Peaceful and untitled guests now throng in summer where St. Vincents and Northumberlands once rustled and glittered; and there is nothing to recall those brilliant days except the painted tiles on the chimney, where there is a choice society of coquettes and beaux, priests and conjurers, beggars and dancers, and every wig and hoop dates back to the days of <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Sometimes when I stand upon this pier by night, and look across the calm black water, so still, perhaps, that the starry reflections seem to drop through it in prolonged javelins of light instead of resting on the surface, and the opposite lighthouse spreads its cloth of gold across the bay,--I can imagine that I discern the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>English</rs> <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> vessels just weighing anchor; I see <persName n="Lauzun,,De,,," id="n0220.0002.00052.00027" reg="default:Lauzun,De,,,"><foreName>De</foreName> <surname>Lauzun</surname></persName> and <persName n="Noailles,,De,,," id="n0220.0002.00052.00028" reg="default:Noailles,De,,,"><foreName>De</foreName> <surname>Noailles</surname></persName> embarking, and catch the last sheen upon their lace, the last glitter of their swords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>It vanishes, and I see only the lighthouse gleam, and the dark masts of a sunken ship across the neighboring island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Those motionless spars have, after all, a nearer interest, and, as I saw them sink, I will tell their tale.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>That vessel came in here <num value="1">one</num> day last <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, a stately, full-sailed bark; nor was it known, till she had anchored, that she was a mass of imprisoned fire below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The captain and crew retreated to the deck, and made the hatches fast, leaving even their clothing and provisions below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>They remained on deck, after reaching this harbor, till the planks grew too hot beneath their feet, and the water came boiling from the pumps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Then the vessel was towed into a depth of <num value="5">five</num> fathoms, to be scuttled and sunk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>I watched her go down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Early impressions from <quote>Peter Parley</quote> had portrayed the sinking of a <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> vessel as a frightful plunge, endangering all around, like a maelstrom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The actual process was merely a subsidence so calm and gentle that a child might have stood upon the deck till it sank beneath him, and then might have floated away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Instead of a convulsion, it was something stately and very pathetic to the imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The bark remained almost level, the bows a little higher than the stern; and her breath appeared to be surrendered in a series of pulsations, as if every gasp of the lungs admitted more of the suffocating wave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>After each long heave, she went visibly a few inches deeper, and then paused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The face of the benign <rs>Emperor</rs>, her namesake, was on the stern; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sank the carven beard, then the rather mutilated nose, then the white and staring eyes, that gazed blankly over the engulfing waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The figure-head was <persName><foreName>Trajan</foreName></persName> again, at full length, with the costume of an Indian hunter, and the face of a Roman sage; this image lingered longer, and then vanished, like <persName n="Hugo,,Victor,,," id="n0220.0002.00053.00029" reg="default:Hugo,Victor,,,"><foreName>Victor</foreName> <surname>Hugo</surname></persName>'s Gilliatt, by cruel gradations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Meanwhile the gilded name upon the taffrail had slowly disappeared also; but even when the ripples began to meet across her deck, still her descent was <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>As the water gained, the hidden fire was extinguished, and the smoke, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> densely rising, grew rapidly less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Yet when it had stopped altogether, and all but the top of the cabin had disappeared, there came a new ebullition of steam, like a hot spring, throwing itself several feet in air, and then ceasing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>As the vessel went down, several beams and planks came springing endwise up the hatchway, like liberated men. But nothing had a stranger look to me than some great black casks which had been left on deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>These, as the water floated them, seemed to stir and wake, and to become gifted with life, and then got into motion and wallowed heavily about, like hippopotami or any unwieldy and bewildered beasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>At last the most enterprising of them slid somehow to the bulwark, and, after several clumsy efforts, shouldered itself over; then others bounced out, eagerly following, as sheep leap a wall, and then they all went bobbing away, over the dancing waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>For the wind blew fresh meanwhile, and there were some <num value="20">twenty</num> sail-boats lying &mdash; to with reefed sails by the wreck, like so many sea-birds; and when the loose stuff <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> began to be washed from the deck, they all took wing at once, to save whatever could be picked up, -since at such times, as at a conflagration on land, every little thing seems to assume a value,--and at last <num value="1">one</num> young fellow steered boldly up to the sinking ship itself, sprang upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>the vanishing taffrail for <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">one instant</day></dateStruct>, as if resolved to be the last on board, and then pushed off again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>I never saw anything seem so extinguished out of the universe as that great vessel, which had towered so colossal above my little boat; it was impossible to imagine that she was all there yet, beneath the foaming and indifferent waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>No effort has yet been made to raise her; and a dead eagle seems to have more in common with the living bird than has now this submerged and decaying hulk with the white and winged creature that came sailing into our harbor on that summer day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It shows what conversational resources are always at hand in a seaport town, that the boatman with whom I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> happened to visit this burning vessel had been thrice at sea on ships similarly destroyed, and could give all the particulars of their fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>I know no class of uneducated <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> men whose talk is so apt to be worth hearing as that of sailors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Even apart from their personal adventures and their glimpses at foreign lands, they have made observations of nature which are far more careful and minute than those of farmers, because the very lives of sailors are always at risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Their voyages have also made them sociable and fond of talk, while the pursuits of most men tend to make them silent; and their constant changes of scene, though not touching them very deeply, have really given a certain enlargement to their minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>A quiet demeanor in a seaport town proves nothing; the most inconspicuous man may have the most thrilling career to look back upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>With what undisguised contempt they speak of the enthusiasm displayed over the ocean yacht-race!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>That any man should boast of crossing the <rs>Atlantic</rs> in a schooner of <num value="200">two hundred</num> tons, in presence of those who have more than once reached the <rs>Indian</rs> <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> Ocean in a fishing-smack of <num value="50">fifty</num>, and have beaten in the homeward race the ships in whose company they sailed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>It is not many years since there was here a fishing-skipper, whose surname was <quote>Daredevil,</quote> and who sailed from this port to all parts of the world, on sealing voyages, in a sloop so small that she was popularly said to go under water when she got outside the lights, and never to reappear until she reached her port.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>And not only those who sail on long voyages, but even our local pilots and fishermen, still lead an adventurous and untamed life, less softened than any other by the appliances of modern days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>In their undecked boats they hover day and night along these stormy coasts, and at any hour the beating of the long-roll upon the beach may call their full manhood into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Cowardice is sifted and crushed out from among them by a pressure so constant; and they are withal truthful and steady in their ways, with few vices and many virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>They are born poor, and remain poor, for their work is hard, with more blanks than prizes; but their life is a life for a man, and though it makes them prematurely old, yet their old age <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> comes peacefully and well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>In almost all pursuits the advance of years brings something forlorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It is not merely that the body decays, but that men grow isolated and are pushed aside; there is no common interest between age and youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The old farmer leads a lonely existence, and ceases to meet his compeers except on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>; nobody consults him; his experience has been monotonous, and his age is apt to grow unsocial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The old mechanic finds his tools and his methods superseded by those of younger men. But the superannuated fisherman graduates into an oracle; the longer he lives, the greater the dignity of his experience; he remembers the great storm, the great tide, the great catch, the great shipwreck; and on all emergencies his counsel has weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>He still busies himself about the boats too, and still sails on sunny days to show the youngsters the best fishing-ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>When too infirm for even this, he can at least sun himself beside the landing, and, dreaming over inexhaustible memories, watch the bark of his own life go down. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He had dark eyes, that had a great deal of light in them, without corresponding depth; his hair was dark, straight, and very soft; his mouth expressed sweetness, without much strength; he talked well; and though he was apt to have a wandering look, as if his thoughts were laying a <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> submarine cable to another continent, yet the young girls were always glad to have the semblance of conversation with him in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>He had just enough of that subtile quality called genius, perhaps, to spoil <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> his companions, and then himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>His words had weight with you, though you might know yourself wiser; and if you went to give him the most reasonable advice, you were suddenly seized with a slight paralysis of the tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It was a great square building of rough gray stone, looking like those sombre houses which every <num value="1">one</num> remembers in <placeName key="tgn,7013051;tgn,1127327" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013051;montreal,ile de montreal,quebec,canada,north and central america,Ile de Montreal,Quebec,Canada,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,1127327;montreal,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="montreal,ile de montreal,quebec,canada,north and central america,Ile de Montreal,Quebec,Canada,North and Central America;montreal,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Montreal</placeName>, but which are rare in <quote>the <name>States</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It had been built many years before by some millionnaire from New Orleans, and was left unfinished, nobody knew why, till the garden was a wilderness of bloom, and the windows of ivy. Oldport is the only place in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> where either ivy or traditions will grow; there were, to be sure, no legends about this house that I could hear of, for the ghosts in those parts were feeble-minded and retrospective by reason of age, and perhaps scorned a mansion where nobody had ever lived; but the ivy clustered round the projecting windows as densely as if it had the sins of a dozen generations to hide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/><pb id="p.63" n="63"/></p> 
<p>The house stood just above what were commonly called (from their slaty color) the <rs type="place">Blue Rocks</rs>; it seemed the topmost pebble left by some tide that had receded,--which perhaps it was. Nurses and children thronged daily to these rocks, during the visitors' season, and the fishermen found there a favorite lounging-place; but nobody scaled the wall of the house save myself, and I went there very often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The gate was sometimes opened by <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00063.00035" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>, the silent Bavarian gardener, who was master of the keys; and there were also certain great cats that were always sunning themselves on the steps, and seemed to have grown old and gray in waiting for mice that had never come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They looked as if they knew the past and the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>If the owl is the bird of <persName n="Minerva,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00063.00036" reg="mostcommon:Minerva,nomatch:0"><surname>Minerva</surname></persName>, the cat should be her beast; they have the same sleepy air of unfathomable wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>There was such a quiet and potent spell about the place that <num value="1">one</num> could almost fancy these constant animals to be the transformed bodies of human visitors who had stayed too long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Who knew what tales might be told by these tall, slender birches, clustering so closely by the sombre walls?--birches which <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> were but whispering shrubs when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gray stones were laid, and which now reared above the eaves their white stems and dark boughs, still whispering and waiting till a few more years should show them, across the roof, the topmost blossoms of other birches on the other side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Before the great western doorway spread the outer harbor, whither the coasting vessels came to drop anchor at any approach of storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>These silent visitors, which arrived at dusk and went at dawn, and from which no boat landed, seemed fitting guests before the portals of the silent house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>I was never tired of watching them from the piazza; but <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00064.00037" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> always stayed outside the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It was a whim of his, he said; and once only I got out of him something about the resemblance of the house to some Portuguese mansion, --at <placeName reg="Madeira, Putnam, Ohio" key="tgn,2478598">Madeira</placeName>, perhaps, or at <placeName reg="Rio Janeiro">Rio Janeiro</placeName>, but he did not say,--with which he had no pleasant associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Yet he afterwards seemed to wish to deny this remark, or to confuse my impressions of it, which naturally fixed it the better in my mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>I remember well the morning when he was at last coaxed into approaching the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>It was <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> late in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, and a day of perfect calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>As we looked from the broad piazza, there was a glassy smoothness over all the bay, and the hills were coated with a film, or rather a mere varnish, inconceivably thin, of haze more delicate than any other climate in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> can show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Over the water there were white gulls flying, lazy and low; schools of young mackerel displayed their white sides above the surface; and it seemed as if even a butterfly might be seen for miles over that calm expanse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The bay was covered with mackerel-boats, and <num value="1">one</num> man sculled indolently across the foreground a scarlet skiff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It was so still that every white sail-boat rested where its sail was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> spread; and though the tide was at half-ebb, the anchored boats swung idly different ways from their moorings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Yet there was a continuous ripple in the broad sail of some almost motionless schooner, and there was a constant melodious plash along the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>From the mouth of the bay came up slowly the premonitory line of bluer water, and we knew that a breeze was near.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/><persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00065.00038" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> seemed to rise in spirits as we approached the house, and I noticed no sign of <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> shrinking, except an occasional lowering of the voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Seeing this, I ventured to joke him a little ·on his previous reluctance, and he replied in the same strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>I seated myself at the corner, and began sketching old <placeName key="tgn,7013423" n="1.000 10" reg="Biloxi, Harrison, Mississippi">Fort Louis</placeName>, while he strolled along the piazza, looking in at the large, vacant windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>As he approached the farther end, I suddenly heard him give a little cry of amazement or dismay, and, looking up, saw him leaning against the wall, with pale face and hands clenched.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>A minute sometimes appears a long while; and though I sprang to him instantly, yet I remember that it seemed as if, during that instant, the whole face of things had changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The breeze had come, the bay was rippled, the sail-boats careened to the wind, fishes and birds were gone, and a dark gray cloud had come between us and the sun. Such sudden changes are not, however, uncommon after an interval of calm; and my only conscious thought at the time was of wonder at the strange aspect of my companion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/><quote>What was that?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>asked <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00066.00039" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> in a bewildered tone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>I looked about me, equally puzzled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/><pb id="p.67" n="67"/> <quote>Not there,</quote> he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/><quote>In the window.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>I looked in at the window, saw nothing, and said so. There was the great empty drawing-room, across which <num value="1">one</num> could see the opposite window, and through this the eastern piazza and the garden beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Nothing more was there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>With some persuasion, <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00067.00040" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> was induced to look in.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/><quote> Never let me go to that house again,</quote> he said abruptly, as we entered our own door.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>I pointed out to him the absurdity of thus yielding to a nervous delusion, which was already in part conquered, and he finally promised to revisit the scene with me the next day. To clear all possible misgivings from my own mind, I got the key of the house from <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00067.00041" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>, explored it thoroughly, and was satisfied that no improper visitor had recently entered the drawing-room at least, as the windows were strongly bolted on the inside, and a large cobweb, heavy with dust, hung across the doorway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>This did no great credit to <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00067.00042" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>'s stewardship, but was, perhaps, a slight relief to me. Nor could I <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> see a trace of anything uncanny outside the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>When <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00068.00043" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> went with me, next day, the coast was equally clear, and I was glad to have cured him so easily.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Unfortunately, it did not last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>A few days after, there was a brilliant sunset, after a storm, with gorgeous yellow light slanting everywhere, and the sun looking at us between bars of dark purple cloud, edged with gold where they touched the pale blue sky; all this fading at last into a great whirl of gray to the northward, with a cold purple ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>At the height of the show, I climbed the wall to my favorite piazza, and was surprised to find <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00068.00044" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> already there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>He sat facing the sunset, but with his head sunk between his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>At my approach, he looked up, and rose to his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/><quote>Do not deceive me any more,</quote> he said, almost savagely, and pointed to the window.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>I looked in, and must confess that, for a moment, I too was startled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>There was a perceptible moment of time during which it seemed as if no possible philosophy could explain what appeared in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Not that any object showed itself within <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> the great drawing-room, but I distinctly saw-across the apartment, and through the opposite window &mdash; the dark figure of a man about my own size, who leaned against the long window, and gazed intently on me. Above him spread the yellow sunset light, around him the birch-boughs hung and the ivy-tendrils swayed, while behind him there appeared a glimmering water-surface, across which slowly drifted the tall masts of a schooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It looked strangely like a view I had seen of some foreign harbor,--Amalfi, perhaps, --with a vine-clad balcony and a single human figure in the foreground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>So real and startling was the sight that at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it was not easy to resolve the whole scene into its component parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Yet it was simply such a confused mixture of real and reflected images as <num value="1">one</num> often sees from the window of a railway carriage, where the mirrored interior seems to glide beside the train, with the natural landscape for a background.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>In this case, also, the frame and foliage of the picture were real, and all else was reflected; the sunlit bay behind us was reproduced as in a camera, and the dark figure was but the full-length image of myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/><pb id="p.70" n="70"/></p> 
<p>It was easy to explain all this to <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00070.00045" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName>, but he shook his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/><quote>So cool a philosopher as yourself,</quote> he said, <quote>should remember that this image is not always visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>At our last visit, we looked for it in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>When we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw it, it appeared and disappeared within <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. On your mechanical theory it should be otherwise.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>This staggered me for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Then the ready solution occurred, that the reflection depended on the strength and direction of the light; and I proved to him that, in our case, it had appeared and disappeared with the sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>He was silenced, but evidently not convinced; yet time and common-sense, it seemed, would take care of that.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Soon after all this, I was called out of town for a week or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>If <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00070.00046" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> would go with me, it would doubtless complete the cure, I thought; but this he obstinately declined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>After my departure, my sister wrote, he seemed absolutely to haunt the empty house by the <rs type="place">Blue Rocks</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>He undoubtedly went here to sketch, she thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The house was in charge of a <rs n="real estate" type="product">real-estate</rs> -<pb id="p.71" n="71"/> agent,a retired landscape-painter, whose pictures did not sell so profitably as their originals; and her theory was, that this agent hoped to make our friend buy the place, and so allured him there under pretence of sketching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Moreover, she surmised, he was studying some effect of shadow, because, unlike most men, he appeared in decent spirits only on cloudy days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It is always so easy to fit a man out with a set of ready-made motives!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>But I drew my own conclusions, and was not surprised to hear, soon after, that <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00071.00047" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> was seriously ill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>This brought me back at once,--sailing down from <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> in an open boat, I remember, <num value="1">one</num> lovely moonlight night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Next day I saw <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00071.00048" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName>, who declared that he had suffered from nothing worse than a prolonged sick-headache.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>I soon got out of him all that had happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>He had seen the figure in the window every sunny day, he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Of course he had, if he chose to look for it, and I could only smile, though it perhaps seemed unkind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>But I stopped smiling when he went on to tell that, not satisfied with these observations, he had visited the house by <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> moonlight also, and had then seen, as he averred, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> figure standing beside the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Of course, there was no defence against such a theory as this, except simply to laugh it down; but it made me very anxious, for it showed that he was growing thoroughly morbid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/><quote>Either it was pure fancy,</quote> I said, <quote>or it was <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00072.00049" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> the gardener.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>But here he was prepared for me. It seemed that, on seeing the <num value="2">two</num> figures, <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00072.00050" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> had at once left the piazza, and, with an instinct of common-sense that was surprising, had crossed the garden, scaled the wall, and looked in at the window of <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00072.00051" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>'s little cottage, where the man and his wife were quietly seated at supper, probably after a late fishing-trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/><quote>There was another reason,</quote> he said; but here he stopped, and would give no description of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> figure, which he had, however, seen twice again, always by moonlight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>He consented to let me accompany him the following night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>We accordingly went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>It was a calm, clear night, and the moon lay brightly on the bay. The distant shores looked low and filmy; a naval vessel was in the harbor, and there was a ball on <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> board, with music and fire-works; some fishermen were singing in their boats, late as was the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/><persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00073.00052" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> was absorbed in his own gloomy reveries; and when we had crossed the wall, the world seemed left outside, and the glamour of the place began to creep over me also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>I seemed to see my companion relapsing into some phantom realm, beyond power of withdrawal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>I talked, sang, whistled; but it was all a rather hollow effort, and soon ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The great house looked gloomy and impenetrable, the moonlight appeared sick and sad, the birch-boughs rustled in a dreary way. We went up the steps in no jubilant mood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>I crossed the piazza at once, looked in at the farthest window, and saw there my own image, though far more faintly than in the sunlight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/><persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00073.00053" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> then joined me, and his reflected shape stood by mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Something of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ghostly impression was renewed, I must confess, by this meeting of the <num value="2">two</num> shadows; there was something rather awful in the way the bodiless things nodded and gesticulated at each other in silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Still, there was nothing more than this, as <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00073.00054" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> was compelled to own; and I was trying to turn <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> the whole affair into ridicule, when suddenly, without sound or warning, I saw &mdash; as distinctly as I perceive the words I now write &mdash; yet another figure stand at the window, gaze steadfastly at us for a moment, and then disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>It was, as I fancied, that of a woman, but was totally enveloped in a very full cloak, reaching to the ground, with a peculiarly cut hood, that stood erect and seemed half as long as the body of the garment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>I had a vague recollection of having seen some such costume in a picture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Of course, I dashed round the corner of the house, threaded the birch-trees, and stood on the eastern piazza.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>No <num value="1">one</num> was there Without losing an instant, I ran to the garden wall and climbed it, as <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00074.00055" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> had done, to look into <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00074.00056" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>'s cottage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>That worthy was just getting into bed, in a state of complicated <hi rend="italics">dishabille</hi>, his black-bearded head wrapped in an old scarlet handkerchief that made him look like a retired pirate in reduced circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>He being accounted for, I vainly traversed the shrubberies, returned to the western piazza, watched awhile uselessly, and went home with <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00074.00057" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName>, a good deal puzzled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>r <pb id="p.75" n="75"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>By daylight the whole thing seemed different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>That I had seen the figure there was no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>It was not a reflected image, for we had no companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>It was, then, human.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>After all, thought I, it is a commonplace thing enough, this masquerading in a cloak and hood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> has observed <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00075.00058" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName>'s nocturnal visits, and is amusing himself at his expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The peculiarity was, that the thing was so well done, and the figure had such an air of dignity, that somehow it was not so easy to make light of it in talking with him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>I went into his room, next day. His sick headache, or whatever it was, had come on again, and he was lying on his bed. <persName n="Rutherford,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00075.00059" reg="mostcommon:Rutherford,nomatch:0"><surname>Rutherford</surname></persName>'s strange old book on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Sight lay open before him. <quote>Look there,</quote> he said; and I read the motto of a chapter:--<quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>I threw the book indignantly from me, and began to invent doggerel, parodying this precious incantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>But <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00075.00060" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> did not seem to enjoy <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> the joke, and it grows tiresome to enact <num value="1">one</num>'s own farce and do <num value="1">one</num>'s own applauding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>For several days after he was laid up in earnest; but instead of getting any mental rest from this, he lay poring over that preposterous book, and it really seemed as if his brain were a little disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Meanwhile I watched the great house, day and night, sought for footsteps, and, by some odd fancy, took frequent observations on the gardener and his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Failing to get any clew, I waited <num value="1">one</num> day for <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00076.00061" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>'s absence, and made a call upon the wife, under pretence of hunting up a missing handkerchief,--for she had been my laundress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>I found the handsome, swarthy creature, with her <num value="6">six</num> bronzed children around her, training up the <name>Madeira</name> vine that made a bower of the whole side of her little, black, gambrel-roofed cottage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>On learning my errand, she became full of sympathy, and was soon emptying her bureau-drawers in pursuit of the lost handkerchief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>As she opened the lowest drawer, I saw within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>it something which sent all the blood to my face for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>It was a black cloth cloak, with a stiff hood <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> long, of precisely the pattern worn by the <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> unaccountable visitant at the window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>I turned almost fiercely upon her; but she looked so innocent as she stood there, caressing and dusting with her fingers what was evidently a pet garment, that it was really impossible to denounce her.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>As she spoke, she dropped it with a cry, and a little mouse sprang from the skirts, and whisked away into some corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>This contained, moreover, a small family of mouselets, who certainly had not taken part in any midnight masquerade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>The secret seemed more remote than ever, for I knew that there was no other Portuguese family in the town, and there was no confounding this peculiar local costume with any other.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>He was, by an odd coincidence, looking over a portfolio of <placeName key="tgn,1007070" n="1.000 1" reg="faial,horta,ilhas dos acores,portugal,europe">Fayal</placeName> sketches made by himself during his late voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Among them were a dozen studies of just such <hi rend="italics">capotes</hi> as I had seen,--some in profile, completely screening the wearer, others disclosing women's faces, old or young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>He seemed to wish to put them away, however, when I came in. Really, the plot seemed to thicken; and it was a little provoking to understand it no better, when all the materials seemed close to <num value="1">one</num>'s hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>A day or <num value="2">two</num> later, I was summoned to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Returning thence by the stage-coach, we drove from <placeName reg="Tiverton, Newport, Rhode Island" key="tgn,2095122">Tiverton</placeName>, the whole length of the island, under <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> <num value="1">one</num> of those wild and wonderful skies which give, better than anything in nature, the effect of a field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The heavens were filled with <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> separate masses of cloud, varying in shade from palest gray to iron-black, borne rapidly to and fro by upper and lower currents of opposing wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>They seemed to be charging, retreating, breaking, recombining, with puffs of what seemed smoke, and a few wan sunbeams sometimes striking through for fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Wherever the eye turned, there appeared some flying fragment not seen before; and yet in an hour this noiseless <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName> grew still, and a settled leaden film overspread the sky, yielding only to some level lines of light where the sun went down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Perhaps our driver was looking toward the sky more than to his own affairs, for, just as all this ended a wheel gave out, and we had to stop in <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName> for repairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>By the time we were again in motion, the changing wind had brought up a final thunder-storm, which broke upon us ere we reached our homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>It was rather an uncommon thing, so late in the season; for the lightning, like other brilliant visitors, usually appears <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> in Oldport during only a month or <num value="2">two</num> of every year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>The coach set me down at my own door, so soaked that I might have floated in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Who knew what insane experiment might have come into that boy's head?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>With sudden impulse, I went down stairs, and found the whole house empty, until a stupid old woman, coming in from the wood-house with her apron full of turnips, told me that <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00080.00064" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> had been missing since nightfall, after being for a week in bed, dangerously ill, and sometimes slightly delirious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>The family had become alarmed, and were out with lanterns, in search of him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>It was safe to say that none of them had more <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> reason to be alarmed than I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>It was something, however, to know where to seek him. Meeting <num value="2">two</num> neighboring fishermen, I took them with me. As we approached the well-known wall, the blast blew out our lights, and we could scarcely speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>The lightning had grown less frequent, yet sheets of-flame seemed occasionally to break over the dark, square sides of the house, and to send a flickering flame along the ridge-pole and eaves, like a surf of light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>A surf of water broke also behind us on the <rs type="place">Blue Rocks</rs>, sounding as if it pursued our very footsteps; and <num value="1">one</num> of the men whispered hoarsely to me, that a Nantucket brig had parted her cable, and was drifting in shore.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>As we entered the garden, lights gleamed in the shrubbery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>To my surprise, it was <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00081.00065" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> and his wife, with their <num value="2">two</num> oldest children,--these last being quite delighted with the stir, and showing so much illumination, in the lee of the house, that it was quite a Feast of Lanterns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>They seemed a little surprised at meeting us, too; but we might as well have talked from <placeName reg="Point Judith, Washington, Rhode Island" key="tgn,2589522">Point Judith</placeName> to Beaver Tail as to have attempted conversation there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>I walked round the building; but a flash of lightning <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> showed nothing on the western piazza save a birch-tree, which lay across, blown down by the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>I therefore went inside, with <placeName><persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00082.00066" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>hold, leaving the fishermen without.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Never shall I forget that search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>As we went from empty room to room, the thunder seemed rolling on the very roof, and the sharp flashes of lightning appeared to put out our lamps and then kindle them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>We traversed the upper regions, mounting by a ladder to the attic; then descended into the cellar and the wine-vault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>The thorough bareness of the house, the fact that no bright-eyed mice peeped at us from their holes, no uncouth insects glided on the walls, no flies buzzed in the unwonted lamplight, scarcely a spider slid down his damp and trailing web,--all this seemed to enhance the mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The vacancy was more dreary than desertion: it was something old which had never been young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>We found ourselves speaking in whispers; the children kept close to their parents; we seemed to be chasing some awful Silence from room to room; and the last apartment, the great drawing-room, we really seemed loath to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The less the rest of the <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> house had to show, the more, it seemed, must be concentrated there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Even as we entered, a blast of air from a broken pane extinguished our last light, and it seemed to take many minutes to rekindle it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>As it shone once more, a brilliant lightning-flash also swept through the window, and flickered and flickered, as if it would never have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>The eldest child suddenly screamed, and pointed with her finger, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to <num value="1">one</num> great window and then to its opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>My eyes instinctively followed the successive directions; and the double glance gave me all I came to seek, and more than all. Outside the western window lay <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00083.00067" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName>, his white face against the pane, his eyes gazing across and past us,--struck down doubtless by the fallen tree, which lay across the piazza, and hid him from external view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Opposite him, and seen through the eastern window, stood, statue-like, the hooded figure, but with the great <hi rend="italics">capote</hi> thrown back, showing a sad, eager, girlish face, with dark eyes, and a good deal of black hair,--<num value="1">one</num> of those faces of peasant beauty such as <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> never shows, -faces where ignorance is almost raised into refinement <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> by its childlike look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Contrasted with <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00084.00068" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName>'s wild gaze, the countenance wore an expression of pitying forgiveness, almost of calm; yet it told of wasting sorrow and the wreck of a life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Gleaming lustrous beneath the lightning, it had a more mystic look when the long flash had ceased, and the single lantern burned beneath it, like an altar-lamp before a shrine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/><quote>It is <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Emilia</foreName></persName>,</quote> exclaimed the little girl; and as she spoke, the father, turning angrily upon her, dashed the light to the ground, and groped his way out without a word of answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>I was too much alarmed about <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00084.00069" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> to care for aught else, and quickly made my way to the western piazza, where I found him stunned by the fallen tree,--injured, I feared, internally,--still conscious, but unable to speak.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>With the aid of my <num value="2">two</num> companions I got him home, and he was ill for several weeks before he died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>During his illness he told me all he had to tell; and though <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00084.00070" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> and his family disappeared next day,--perhaps going on board the <rs>Nantucket</rs> brig, which had narrowly escaped shipwreck,--I afterwards learned all the remaining <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> facts from the only neighbor in whom they had placed confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>This was the easier, as it was <num value="1">one</num> of her whims to go out only by night, when she had haunted the great house, which, she said, reminded her of her own island, so that she liked to wear thither the <hi rend="italics">capote</hi> which had been the pride of her heart at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>On the few occasions when she had caught a glimpse 6f <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00085.00074" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName>, he had seemed to her, no doubt, as much a phantom as she seemed to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>I got traces of the family afterwards at <placeName reg="Nantucket Island, Nantucket, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1008293">Nantucket</placeName>, and later at <placeName reg="Narragansett, Washington, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7014183">Narragansett</placeName>, and had reason to think that <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00085.00075" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:1"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> was employed, <num value="1">one</num> summer, by a <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> farmer on Conanicut; but I was always just too late for them; and the money which <persName n="Severance,,,,," id="n0220.0003.00086.00076" reg="mostcommon:Severance,nomatch:0"><surname>Severance</surname></persName> left, as his only reparation for poor <persName><foreName>Emilia</foreName></persName>, never was paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>His father came, and prosed, and measured the windows of the empty house, and calculated angles of reflection, and poured even death and despair into his crucible of commonplace; the mother whined in her feebler way at home; while the only brother, a talkative medical student, tried to pooh-pooh it all, and sent me a letter demonstrating that <persName><foreName>Emilia</foreName></persName> was never in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, and that the whole was an hallucination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>I cared nothing for his theory; it all seemed like a dream to me, and, as all the actors but myself are gone, it seems so still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>The great house is yet unoccupied, and likely to remain so; and he who looks through its western window may still be startled by the weird image of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>As I <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> lingered round it, to-day, beneath the winter sunlight, the snow drifted pitilessly past its ivied windows, and so hushed my footsteps that I scarce knew which was the phantom, myself or my reflection, and wondered if the medical student would not argue me out of existence next.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>It must be owned, indeed, that timbers soaked long enough in salt-water seem almost to lose their capacity of being burnt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>The murmur of the surf is not so soft or so solemn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>There are the merest hints and traceries of tones,--phantom voices, more remote from noise than anything which is noise; and yet there is an undertone of roar, as from a <num value="1000">thousand</num> cities, the cities whence these wild voyagers came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Watch the decreasing sounds of a .fire as it dies,--for it seems cruel to leave it, as we do, to die alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>I watched beside this hearth last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>As the fire sank down, the little voices <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> grew stiller and more still, and at last there came only irregular beats, at varying intervals, as if from a heart that acted spasmodically, or as if it were measuring off by ticks the little remnant of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Then it said, <quote>Hush!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/><num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times, and there came something so like a sob that it seemed human; and then all was still.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>If these dying voices are so sweet and subtile, what legends must be held untold by yonder fragments that lie unconsumed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Photography has familiarized us with the thought that every visible act, since the beginning of the world, has stamped itself upon surrounding surfaces, even if we have not yet skill to discern and hold the image.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>And especially, in looking on a liquid expanse, such as the ocean in calm, <num value="1">one</num> is haunted with these fancies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>I gaze into its depths, and wonder if no stray reflection has been imprisoned there, still accessible to human eyes, of some scene of passion or despair it has witnessed; as some maiden visitor at Holyrood Palace, looking in the ancient metallic mirror, might start at the thought that perchance some lineament of <persName n="Stuart,,Mary,,," id="n0220.0004.00101.00086" reg="default:Stuart,Mary,,,"><foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> may suddenly look out, in desolate and forgotten beauty, mingled with <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> her own. And if the mere waters of the ocean, satiate and wearied with tragedy as they must be, still keep for our fancy such records, how much more might we attribute a human consciousness to these shattered fragments, each seared by its own special grief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Yet while they are silent, I like to trace back for these component parts of my fire such brief histories as I share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>This block, for instance, came from the large schooner which now lies at the end of Castle Hill Beach, bearing still aloft its broken masts and shattered rigging, and with its keel yet stanch, except that the stern-post is gone,--so that each tide sweeps in its green harvest of glossy kelp, and then tosses it in the hold like hay, desolately tenanting the place which once sheltered men. The floating weed, so graceful in its own place, looks but dreary when thus confined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>On that fearfully cold Monday of last winter (<dateStruct value="1866-01-08"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="8">8</day>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>) when the mercury stood at--<num value="10">10</num>&deg;, even in this mildest corner of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>,--this vessel was caught helplessly amid the ice that drifted out of the west passage of <placeName reg="Narragansett Bay, Bristol, Rhode Island" key="tgn,1113485">Narragansett Bay</placeName>, before the fierce north-wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>They tried to beat into the <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> eastern entrance, but the schooner seemed in sinking condition, the sails and helm were clogged with ice, and every rope, as an eye-witness told me, was as large as a man's body with frozen sleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Twice they tacked across, making no progress; and then, to save their lives, ran the vessel on the rocks and got ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>After they had left her, a higher wave swept her off, and drifted her into a little cove, where she has ever since remained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>There were <num value="12">twelve</num> wrecks along this shore last winter,--more than during any season for <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>I remember when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these lay in great fragments on <placeName key="tgn,2361557;tgn,2361556" n="0.045 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2361557;Graves Point, Newport, Rhode Island,Newport,Rhode Island,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2361556;Graves Point, Talbot, Maryland,Talbot,Maryland,United States,North and Central America" reg="Graves Point, Newport, Rhode Island,Newport,Rhode Island,United States,North and Central America;Graves Point, Talbot, Maryland,Talbot,Maryland,United States,North and Central America">Graves Point</placeName>, a schooner having been stranded on Cormorant Rocks outside, and there broken in pieces by the surf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>She had been split lengthwise, and <num value="1">one</num> great side was leaning up against the sloping rock, bows on, like some wild sea-creature never before beheld of men, and come there but to die. So strong was this impression that when I afterwards saw men at work upon the wreck, tearing out the iron bolts and chains, it seemed like torturing the last moments of a living thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>At my next visit there was no person in sight; another companion fragment had <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> floated ashore, and the <num value="2">two</num> lay peacefully beside the sailors' graves (which give the name to the point), as if they found comfort there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>A little farther on there was a brig ashore and deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>A fog came in from the sea; and, as I sat by the graves, some unseen passing vessel struck <num value="8">eight</num> bells for noon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>For a moment I fancied that it came from the empty brig,--a ghostly call, to summon phantom sailors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>That smouldering brand, which has alternately gleamed and darkened for so many minutes, I brought from <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0220.0004.00104.00087" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s Neck last winter, when the <rs>Brenton</rs>'s Reef Light-ship went ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Yonder the oddly shaped vessel rides at anchor now, <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from land, bearing her lanterns aloft at fore and main top.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>It was thus that it happened:--<pb id="p.105" n="105"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>There had been a heavy gale from the southeast, which, after a few hours of lull, suddenly changed in the afternoon to the southwest, which is, on this coast, the prevailing direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Beginning about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>, this new wind had risen almost to a hurricane by <num value="6">six</num>, and held with equal fury till midnight, after which it greatly diminished, though, when I visited the wreck next morning, it was hard to walk against the blast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>The light-ship went adrift at <time value="8pm">eight in the evening</time>; the men let go another anchor, with <num value="40">forty</num> fathoms of cable; this parted also, but the cable dragged, as she drifted in, keeping the vessel's head to the wind, which was greatly to her advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>The great waves took her over <num value="5">five</num> lines of reef, on each of which her keel grazed or held for a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>She came ashore on <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0220.0004.00105.00088" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s Neck at last, about <num value="11">eleven</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>It was utterly dark; the sea broke high over tile ship, even over her lanterns, and the crew could only guess that they were near the land by the sound of the surf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>The captain was not on board, and the mate was in command, though his leg had been broken while holding the tiller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>They could not hear each other's voices, and could <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> scarcely cling to the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>There seemed every chance that the ship would go to pieces before daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>At last <num value="1">one</num> of the crew, named <persName n="Martin,,William,,," id="n0220.0004.00106.00089" reg="default:Martin,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Martin</surname></persName>, a Scotchman, thinking, as he afterwards told me, of his wife and <num value="3">three</num> children, and of the others on board who had families,--and that something must be done, and he might as well do it as anybody,--got a rope bound around his waist, and sprang overboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>I asked the mate next day whether he ordered <persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n0220.0004.00106.00090" reg="nearbymention:Martin,William,,,"><surname>Martin</surname></persName> to do this, and he said, <quote>No, he volunteered it. I would not have ordered him, for I would not have done it myself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>What made the thing most remarkable was, that the man actually could not swim, and did not know how far off the shore was, but trusted to the waves to take him thither,perhaps <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure>. His trust was repaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Struggling in the mighty surf, he sometimes felt the rocks beneath his feet, sometimes bruised his hands against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>At any rate he got on shore alive, and, securing his rope, made his way over the moors to the town, and summoned his captain, who was asleep in his own house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>They returned at once to the spot, found the line still <pb id="p.107" n="107"/> fast, and the rest of the crew, <num value="4">four</num> in number, lowered the whaleboat, and were pulled to shore by the rope, landing safely before daybreak.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>When I saw the vessel next morning, she lay in a little cove, stern on, not wholly out of water,steady and upright as in a dry-dock, with no sign of serious injury, except that the rudder was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>She did not seem like a wreck; the men were the wrecks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>As they lay among the rocks, bare or tattered, scarcely able to move, waiting for low tide to go on board the vessel, it was like a scene after a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>They appeared too inert, poor fellows, to do anything but yearn toward the sun. When they changed position for shelter, from time to time, they crept along the rocks, instead of walking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>They were like the little floating sprays of sea-weed, when you take them from the water and they become a mere mass of pulp in your hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The feat seemed to me then, and has always seemed, almost incredible, even for an expert swimmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>He thus <pb id="p.108" n="108"/> summed up the motives for his action: <quote>I thought that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and I was next, and if I did the best I could, no man could do more than that; so I jumped overboard.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>It is pleasant to add, that, though a poor man, he utterly declined <num value="1">one</num> of those small donations of money by which we Anglo-Saxons are wont clumsily to express our personal enthusiasms; and I think I appreciated his whole action the more for its coming just at the close of a war during which so many had readily accepted their award of praise or pay for acts of less intrinsic daring than his.</p>

I had not seen them together since their marriage; my admiration for his varied genius and her unvarying grace was at its height, and I was really annoyed at the delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>My fair cousin, with her usual exact housekeeping, had prepared everything for her guest, and then bequeathed me, as she wrote, to <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00114.00095" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName> and baby <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>It was a pleasant arrangement, for between baby <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> and me there existed a species of passion, I might almost say of betrothal, ever since that little <num value="3">three</num>-year-old sunbeam had blessed my mother's house by lingering awhile in it, <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Still I went to bed disappointed, though the delightful windows of the chamber looked out upon the glimmering <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> bay, and the swinging lanterns at the yard-arms of the frigates shone like some softer constellation beneath the brilliant sky. The house was so close upon the water that the cool waves seemed to plash deliciously against its very basement; and it was a comfort to think that, if there were no adequate human greetings that night, there would be plenty in the morning, since <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> would inevitably be pulling my eyelids apart before sunrise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>It was scarcely dawn when I was roused by a little arm round my neck, and waked to think I had <num value="1">one</num> of <persName><foreName>Raphael</foreName></persName>'s cherubs by my side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Fingers of waxen softness were ruthlessly at work upon my eyes, and the little form that met my touch felt lithe and elastic, like a kitten's limbs There was just light enough to see the child, perched on the edge of the bed, her soft blue dressing-gown trailing over the white night-dress, while her black and long-fringed eyes shone through the dimness of morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>She yielded gladly to my grasp, and I could fondle again the silken hair, the velvety brunette cheek, the plump, childish shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Yet sleep still half held me, and when my cherub appeared to hold it a cherubic <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> practice to begin the day with a demand for lively anecdote, I was fain drowsily to suggest that she might <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tell some stories to her doll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>With the sunny readiness that was a part of her nature, she straightway turned to that young lady, -plain <persName n="Halliday,,Susan,,," id="n0220.0005.00116.00096" reg="default:Halliday,Susan,,,"><foreName>Susan</foreName> <surname>Halliday</surname></persName>, with both cheeks patched, and eyes of different colors,--and soon discoursed both her and me into repose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>When I waked again, it was to find the child conversing with the morning star, which still shone through the window, scarcely so lucent as her eyes, and bidding it go home to its mother, the sun. Another lapse into dreams, and then a more vivid awakening, and she had my ear at last, and won story after story, requiting them with legends of her own youth, <quote>almost a year ago,</quote> --how she was perilously lost, for instance, in the small front yard, with a little playmate, early in the afternoon, and how they came and peeped into the window, and thought all the world had forgotten them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Then the sweet voice, distinct in its articulation as <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>'s, went straying off into wilder fancies,--a chaos of autobiography and conjecture, like the letters of a war correspondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>You would have <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> thought her little life had yielded more pangs and fears than might have sufficed for the discovery of the <name>North Pole</name>; but breakfast-time drew near at last, and <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00117.00097" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName>'s honest voice was heard outside the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>I rather envied the good <rs>Scotchwoman</rs> the pleasant task of polishing the smooth cheeks and combing the dishevelled silk; but when, a little later, the small maiden was riding down stairs in my arms, I envied no <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>At sight of the bread and milk, my cherub was transformed into a hungry human child, chiefly anxious to reach the bottom of her porringer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>I was with her a great deal that day. She gave no manner of trouble: it was like having the charge of a floating butterfly, endowed with warm arms to clasp, and a silvery voice to prattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>I sent <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00117.00098" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName> out to sail, with the other servants, by way of frolic, and <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>'s perfect temperament was shown in the way she watched the departing.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>Life to her was no alternation between joy and grief, but only between joy and delight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>Twilight brought us to an improvised concert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Climbing the piano-stool, she went over the notes with her little taper fingers, touching the keys in a light, knowing way, that proved her a musician's child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>Then I must play for her, and let the dance begin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>This was a wondrous performance on her part, and consisted at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in hopping up and down on <num value="1">one</num> spot, with no change of motion but in her hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>She resembled a minute and irrepressible Shaker, or a live and beautiful <hi rend="italics">marionnette</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>Then came her supper, which, like its predecessors, was a solid and absorbing meal; then <num value="1">one</num> more fairy story, to magnetize her off, and she danced and sang herself up stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>And if she <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came to me in the morning with a halo round her head, she seemed still to retain it when I at last watched her kneeling in the little bed-perfectly motionless, with her <pb id="p.119" n="119"/> hands placed together, and her long lashes sweeping her cheeks-to repeat <num value="2">two</num> verses of a hymn which <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00119.00100" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName> had taught her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>This being ended, the doll and her mistress reposed together, and only an occasional toss of the vigorous limbs, or a stifled baby murmur, would thenceforth prove, through the darkened hours, that the <num value="1">one</num> figure had in it more of life than the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>On the next morning Kenmure and <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> came back to us, and I walked down to receive them at the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>I had forgotten how striking was their appearance, as they stood together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>His broad, strong, <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00119.00102" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> look, his manly bearing and clear blue eyes, enhanced the fascination of her darker beauty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>America is full of the short-lived bloom and freshness of girlhood; but it is a rare thing in <num value="1">one</num>'s life to see a beauty that really controls with a permanent charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>When in those days we used to read, in <persName n="Petrarch,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00120.00103" reg="mostcommon:Petrarch,nomatch:0"><surname>Petrarch</surname></persName>'s <num value="123" type="ordinal">one hundred and twenty-third</num> sonnet, that he had once beheld on earth angelic manners and celestial charms, whose very remembrance was a delight and an affliction, since it made all else appear but dream and shadow, we could easily fancy that nature had certain permanent attributes which accompanied the name of <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Our <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> had that rich brunette beauty before which the mere snow and roses of the blonde must always seem wan and unimpassioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>In the superb suffusions of her cheek there seemed to flow a tide of passions and powers that might have been tumultuous in a meaner woman, but over which, in her, the clear and brilliant eyes and the sweet, proud mouth presided in unbroken calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>These superb tints implied resources only, not a struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>With this torrent from the tropics in her veins, she was the most equable person I ever saw, and had a supreme and delicate good-sense, which, if not supplying the place of genius, at least comprehended its work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Not intellectually gifted herself, <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> perhaps, she seemed the cause of gifts in others, and furnished the atmosphere in which all showed their best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>With the steady and thoughtful enthusiasm of her <placeName reg="Puritan, Vinton, Ohio" key="tgn,2601475">Puritan</placeName> ancestors, she combined that charm which is so rare among their descendants,--a grace which fascinated the humblest, while it would have been just the same in the society of kings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Her person had the equipoise and symmetry of her mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>While it had its separate points of beauty, each a source of distinct and peculiar pleasure,--as, the outline of her temples, the white line that parted her night-black hair, the bend of her wrists, the moulding of her finger-tips,--yet these details were lost in the overwhelming sweetness of her presence, and the serene atmosphere that she diffused ever all human life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>A few days passed rapidly by us. We walked and rode and boated and read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>Little Marian came and went, a living sunbeam, a self-sufficing thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>It was soon obvious that she was far less demonstrative toward her parents than toward me; while her mother, gracious to her as to all, yet rarely caressed her, and Kenmure, though habitually <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> kind, was inclined to ignore her existence, and could scarcely tolerate that she should for <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">one instant</day></dateStruct> preoccupy his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>For <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> he lived, and she must live for him. He had a studio, which I rarely entered and <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> never, though <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> was almost constantly there; and after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cordiality was past, I observed that their daily expeditions were always arranged for only <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>The weather was beautiful, and they led the wildest outdoor life, cruising all day or all night among the islands, regardless of hours, and almost of health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>No matter: Kenmure liked it, and what he liked she loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>When at home, they were chiefly in the studio, he painting, modelling, poetizing perhaps, and she inseparably united with him in all. It was very beautiful, this unworldly and passionate love, and I could have borne to be omitted in their daily plans,--since little <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> was left to me,--save that it seemed so strange to omit her also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Besides, there grew to be something a little oppressive in this peculiar atmosphere; it was like living in a greenhouse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Yet they always spoke in the simplest way of this absorbing passion, as of something about which <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> no reticence was needed; it was too sacred not to be mentioned; it would be wrong not to utter freely to all the world what was doubtless the best thing the world possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Thus Kenmure made <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> his model in all his art; not to coin her into wealth or fame,--he would have scorned it; he would have valued fame and wealth only as instruments for proclaiming her. Looking simply at these <num value="2">two</num> lovers, then, it was plain that no human union could be more noble or stainless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>Yet so far as others were concerned, it sometimes seemed to me a kind of duplex selfishness, so profound and so undisguised as to make <num value="1">one</num> shudder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/><quote>Is it,</quote> I asked myself at such moments, <quote>a great consecration, or a great crime?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>But something must be allowed, perhaps, for my own private dissatisfactions in <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>'s behalf.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>I had easily persuaded <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00123.00104" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName> to let me have a peep every night at my darling, as she slept; and once I was surprised to find <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> sitting by the small white bed. Graceful and beautiful as she always was, she never before had seemed to me so lovely, for she never had seemed quite like a mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>But I could not demand a sweeter look <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> of tenderness than that with which she now gazed upon her child.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Little Marian lay with <num value="1">one</num> brown, plump hand visible from its full white sleeve, while the other nestled half hid beneath the sheet, grasping a pair of blue morocco shoes, the last acquisition of her favorite doll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>Drooping from beneath the pillow hung a handful of scarlet poppies, which the child had wished to place under her head, in the very superfluous project of putting herself to sleep thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Her soft brown hair was scattered on the sheet, her black lashes lay motionless upon the olive cheeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/><persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> wished to move her, that I might see her the better.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/><quote>You will wake her,</quote> exclaimed I, in alarm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/><quote>Wake this little dormouse?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/><persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> lightly answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/><quote>Impossible.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>And, twining her arms about her, the young mother lifted the child from the bed, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times in succession, while the healthy little creature remained utterly undisturbed, breathing the same quiet breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>I watched <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> with amazement; she seemed transformed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>She gayly returned my eager look, and then, <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> seeming suddenly to penetrate its meaning, cast down her eyes, while the color mounted into her cheeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/><quote>You thought,</quote> she said, almost sternly, <quote>that I did not love my child.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/><quote>No,</quote> I said half untruthfully.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/><quote>I can hardly wonder,</quote> she continued, more sadly, <quote>for it is only what I have said to myself a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Sometimes I think that I have lived in a dream, and <num value="1">one</num> that few share with me. I have questioned others, and never yet found a woman who did not admit that her child was more to her, in her secret soul, than her husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>What can they mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Such a thought is foreign to my very nature.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/><quote> Why separate the <num value="2">two</num>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>I asked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/><quote> I must separate them in thought,</quote> she answered, with the air of <num value="1">one</num> driven to bay by her own self-reproaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/><quote>I had, like other young girls, my dream of love and marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>Unlike all the rest, I believe, I found my visions fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>The reality was more than the imagination; and I thought it would be so with my love for my child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cry of that baby told the difference to my ear. I knew it all from that moment; the bliss <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> which had been mine as a wife would never be mine as a mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>If I had not known what it was to adore my husband, I might have been content with my love for <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>But look at that exquisite creature as she lies there asleep, and then think that I, her mother, should desert her if she were dying, for aught I know, at <num value="1">one</num> word from him!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/><quote>Your feeling does not seem natural,</quote> I said, hardly knowing what to answer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/><quote>What good does it serve to know that?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>she said, defiantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/><quote>I say it to myself every day. Once when she was ill, and was given back to me in all the precious helplessness of babyhood, there was such a strange sweetness in it, I thought the charm might remain; but it vanished when she could run about once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>And she is such a healthy, self-reliant little thing,</quote> added <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>, glancing toward the bed with a momentary look of motherly pride that seemed strangely out of place amid these self-denunciations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/><quote>I wish her to be so,</quote> she added.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/><quote>The best service I can do for her is to teach her to stand alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>And at some day,</quote> continued the beautiful woman, her <pb id="p.127" n="127"/> whole face lighting up with happiness, <quote>she may love as I have loved.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/><quote>And your husband,</quote> I said, after a pause,--<quote>does your feeling represent his?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/><quote> My husband,</quote> she said, <quote>lives for his genius, as he should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>You that know him, why do you ask?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/><quote>And his heart?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>I said, half frightened at my own temerity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/><quote> Heart?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>she answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/><quote>He loves me.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Her color mounted higher yet; she had a look of pride, almost of haughtiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>All else seemed forgotten; she had turned away from the child's little bed, as if it had no existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>It flashed upon me that something of the poison of her artificial atmosphere was reaching her already.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>Kenmure's step was heard in the hall, and, with fire in her eyes, she hastened to meet him. I found myself actually breathing more freely after the departure of that enchanting woman, in danger of perishing inwardly, I said to myself, in an air too lavishly perfumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Bending over <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>, I wondered if it were indeed possible that a perfectly healthy life had sprung from that union too intense and too absorbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Yet I had often noticed <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> that the child seemed to wear the temperaments of both her parents as a kind of playful disguise, and to peep at you, now out of the <num value="1">one</num>, now from the other, showing that she had her own individual life behind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>As if by some infantine instinct, the darling turned in her sleep, and came unconsciously nearer me. With <num value="0.5">a half</num>-feeling of self-reproach, I drew around my neck, inch by inch, the little arms that tightened with a delicious thrill; and so I half reclined there till I myself dozed, and the watchful <rs>Janet</rs>, looking in, warned me away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Crossing the entry to my own chamber, I heard Kenmure and <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> down stairs, but I knew that I should be superfluous, and felt that I was sleepy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>I had now, indeed, become always superfluous when they were together, though never when they were apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Even they must be separated sometimes, and then each sought me, in order to discourse about the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Kenmure showed me every sketch he had ever made of <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>There she was, through all the range of her beauty,there she was in clay, in cameo, in pencil, in watercolor, in oils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>He showed me also his poems, <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> and, at last, a longer <num value="1">one</num>, for which pencil and graver had alike been laid aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>All these he kept in a great cabinet she had brought with her to their housekeeping; and it seemed to me that he also treasured every flower she had dropped, every slender glove she had worn, every ribbon from her hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>I could not wonder, seeing his passion as it was. Who would not thrill at the touch of some such slight memorial of <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, or of Heloise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>and what was all the regal beauty of the past to him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>He found every room adorned when she was in it, empty when she had gone,--save that the trace of her was still left on everything, and all appeared but as a garment she had worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>It seemed that even her great mirror must retain, film over film, each reflection of her least movement, the turning of her head, the ungloving of her hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Strange! that, with all this intoxicating presence, she yet led a life so free from self, so simple, so absorbed, that all trace of consciousness was excluded, and she was as free from vanity as her own child.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>As we were once thus employed in the studio, I asked Kenmure, abruptly, if he never shrank <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> from the publicity he was thus giving <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/><quote><persName n="Recamier,Madame,,,," id="n0220.0005.00130.00105" reg="mostcommon:Recamier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <surname>Recamier</surname></persName> was not quite pleased,</quote> I said, <quote>that <persName n="Canova,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00130.00106" reg="mostcommon:Canova,nomatch:0"><surname>Canova</surname></persName> had modelled her bust, even from imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>Do you never shrink from permitting irreverent eyes to look on <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>'s beauty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Think of men as you know them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>Would you give each of them her miniature, perhaps to go with them into scenes of riot and shame?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/><quote>Would to heaven I could!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>said he, passionately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> lets his sun shine on the evil and on the good, but the evil need it most.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>There was a pause; and then I ventured to ask him a question that had been many times upon my lips unspoken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/><quote>Does it never occur to you,</quote> I said, <quote>that <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> cannot live on earth forever?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/><quote>You cannot disturb me about that,</quote> he answered, not sadly, but with a set, stern look, as if fencing for the <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> time against an antagonist who was fore-doomed to be his master in the end. <quote><persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> will outlive me; she must outlive me. I am so sure of it that, every time I come near her, I pray that I may not be paralyzed, and <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> die outside her arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Yet, in any event, what can I do but what I am doing,--devote my whole soul to the perpetuation of her beauty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>It is my only dream,--to re-create her through art. What else is worth doing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>It is for this I have tried-through sculpture, through painting, through verse &mdash; to depict her as she is. Thus far I have failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Why have I failed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>Is it because I have not lived a life sufficiently absorbed in her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>or is it that there is no permitted way by which, after <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has reclaimed her, the tradition of her perfect loveliness may be retained on earth?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>The blinds of the piazza doorway opened, the sweet sea-air came in, the low and level rays of yellow sunset entered as softly as if the breeze were their chariot; and softer and stiller and sweeter than light or air, little <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> stood on the threshold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>She had been in the fields with <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00131.00107" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName>, who had woven for her breeze-blown hair a wreath of the wild gerardia blossoms, whose purple beauty had reminded the good <rs>Scotchwoman</rs> of her own native heather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>In her arms the child bore, like a little gleaner, a great sheaf of graceful golden-rod, as large as her grasp could bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>In <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> all the artist's visions he had seen nothing so aerial, so lovely; in all his passionate portraitures of his idol, he had delineated nothing so like to her. <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>'s cheeks mantled with rich and wine-like tints, her hair took a halo from the sunbeams, her lips parted over the little, milk-white teeth; she looked at us with her mother's eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>I turned to Kenmure to see if he could resist the influence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>He scarcely gave her a glance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/><quote>Go, <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>,</quote> he said, not impatiently,--for he was too thoroughly courteous ever to be ungracious, even to a child,--but with a steady indifference that cut me with more pain than if he had struck her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>The sun dropped behind the horizon, the halo faded from the shining hair and every ray of light from the childish face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>There came in its place that deep, wondering sadness which is more touching than any maturer sorrow,--just as a child's illness melts our hearts more than that of man or woman, it seems so premature and so plaintive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>She turned away; it was the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I had ever seen the little face drawn down, or the tears gathering in the eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>By some kind providence, the mother, coming in flushed and beautiful with <pb id="p.133" n="133"/> walking, met <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> on the piazza, and caught the little thing in her arms with unwonted tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>It was enough for the elastic child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>After <num value="1">one</num> moment of such bliss she could go to <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00133.00108" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName>, go anywhere; and when the same graceful presence came in to us in the studio, we also could ask no more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>We had music and moonlight, and were happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>The atmosphere seemed more human, less unreal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Going up stairs at last, I looked in at the nursery, and found my pet rather flushed, and I fancied that she stirred uneasily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>It passed, whatever it was; for next morning she came in to wake me, looking, as usual, as if a new heaven and earth had been coined purposely for her since she went to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>We had our usual long and important discourse,--this time tending to protracted narrative, of the <name>Mother</name>-Goose description,--until, if it had been possible for any human being to be late for breakfast in that house, we should have been the offenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>But she ultimately went down stairs on my shoulder, and, as Kenmure and <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> were already out rowing, the baby put me in her own place, sat in her mother's chair, and ruled me with a rod of iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>How wonderful was the <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> instinct by which this little creature, who so seldom heard <num value="1">one</num> word of parental severity or parental fondness, knew so thoroughly the language of both!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Had I been the most depraved of children, or the most angelic, I could not have been more sternly excluded from the sugar-bowl, or more overwhelmed with compensating kisses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>Later on that day, while little <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> was taking the very profoundest nap that ever a baby was blessed with, (she had a pretty way of dropping asleep in unexpected corners of the house, like a kitten,) I somehow strayed into a confidential talk with <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00134.00109" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName> about her mistress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>I was rather troubled to find that all her loyalty was for <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>, with nothing left for Kenmure, whom, indeed, she seemed to regard as a sort of objectionable altar, on which her darlings were being sacrificed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>When she came to particulars, certain stray fears of my own were confirmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>It seemed that <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>'s constitution was not fit, <persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00134.00110" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName> averred, to bear these irregular hours, early and late; and she plaintively dwelt on the untasted oatmeal in the morning, the insufficient luncheon, the precarious dinner, the excessive walking and boating, the <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> evening damps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>There was coming to be a look about <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> such as her mother had, who died at <num value="30">thirty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>As for <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>,--but here the complaint suddenly stopped; it would have required far stronger provocation to extract from the faithful soul <num value="1">one</num> word that might seem to reflect on <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>'s mother.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>Another year, and her forebodings had come true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>It is needless to dwell on the interval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>Since then I have sometimes felt a regret almost insatiable in the thought that I should have been absent while all that gracious loveliness was fading and dissolving like a cloud; and yet at other times it has appeared a relief to think that <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> would ever remain to me in the fulness of her beauty, not a tint faded, not a lineament changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>With all my efforts, I arrived only in time to accompany Kenmure home at night, after the funeral service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>We paused at the door of the empty house,--how empty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>I hesitated, but Kenmure motioned to me to follow him in.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>We passed through the hall and went up stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/><persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00135.00111" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName> met us at the head of the stairway, and asked me if I would go in to look at little <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>, <pb id="p.136" n="136"/> who was sleeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>I begged Kenmure to go also but he refused, almost savagely, and went on with heavy step into <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>'s deserted room.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>Almost the moment I entered the child's chamber, she waked up suddenly, looked at me, and said, <quote>I know you, you are my friend.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>She never would call me her cousin, I was always her friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>Then she sat up in bed, with her eyes wide open, and said, as if stating a problem which had been put by for my solution, <quote>I should like to see my mother.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>How our hearts are rent by the unquestioning faith of children, when they come to test the love that has so often worked what seemed to them miracles,--and ask of it miracles indeed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>I tried to explain to her the continued existence of her mother, and she listened to it as if her eyes drank in all that I could say, and more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>But the apparent distance between earth and haven baffled her baby mind, as it so often and so sadly baffles the thoughts of us elders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>I wondered what precise change seemed to her to have taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>This all-fascinating <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>, whom she adored, and who had yet never been to her what <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> other women are to their darlings,--did heaven seem to put her farther off, or bring her more near?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>I could never know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>The healthy child had no morbid questionings; and as she had come into the world to be a sunbeam, she must not fail of that mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>She was kicking about the bed, by this time, in her nightgown, and holding her pink little toes in all sorts of difficult attitudes, when she suddenly said, looking me full in the face: <quote>If my mother was so high up that she had her feet upon a star, do you think that I could see her?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>This astronomical apotheosis startled me for a moment, but I said unhesitatingly, <quote>Yes,</quote> feeling sure that the lustrous eyes that looked in mine could certainly.see as far as <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00137.00112" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName>'s, when <persName n="Beatrice,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00137.00113" reg="mostcommon:Beatrice,nomatch:0"><surname>Beatrice</surname></persName> was transferred from his side to the highest realm of Paradise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>I put my head beside hers upon the pillow, and stayed till I thought she was asleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>I then followed Kenmure into <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>'s chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>It was dusk, but the after-sunset glow still bathed the room with imperfect light, and he lay upon the bed, his hands clenched over his eyes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>There was a deep bow-window where <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> used to sit and watch us, sometimes, when we put off in the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>Her veolian harp was in the casement, breaking its heart in music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>A delicate handkerchief was lodged between the cushions of the window-seat,--the very handkerchief she used to wave, in summer days long gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>The white boats went sailing beneath the evening light, children shouted and splashed in the water, a song came from a yacht, a steam-whistle shrilled from the receding steamer; but she for whom alone those little signs of life had been dear and precious would henceforth be as invisible to our eyes as if time and space had never held her; and the young moon and the evening star seemed but empty things unless they could pilot us to some world where the splendor of her loveliness could match their own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>Twilight faded, evening darkened, and still Kenmure lay motionless, until his strong form grew in my moody fancy to be like some carving of <persName n="Angelo,,Michel,,," id="n0220.0005.00138.00114" reg="default:Angelo,Michel,,,"><foreName>Michel</foreName> <surname>Angelo</surname></persName>'s, more than like a living man. And when he at last startled me by speaking, it was with a voice so far off and so strange, it might almost have come wandering down from the century when <persName n="Angelo,,Michel,,," id="n0220.0005.00138.00115" reg="default:Angelo,Michel,,,"><foreName>Michel</foreName> <surname>Angelo</surname></persName> lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/><pb id="p.139" n="139"/></p> 
<p><quote>You are right,</quote> he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/><quote>I have been living in a fruitless dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>It has all vanished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>The absurdity of speaking of creative art!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>With all my life-long devotion, I have created nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>I have kept no memorial of her presence, nothing to perpetuate the most beautiful of lives.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Before I could answer, the door came softly open, and there stood in the doorway a small white figure, holding aloft a lighted taper of pure alabaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>It was <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> in her little night-dress, with the loose blue wrapper trailing behind her, let go in the effort to hold carefully the doll, <persName n="Halliday,,Susan,,," id="n0220.0005.00139.00116" reg="default:Halliday,Susan,,,"><foreName>Susan</foreName> <surname>Halliday</surname></persName>, robed also for the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/><quote>May I come in?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>said the child.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>Kenmure was motionless at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; then, looking over his shoulder, said merely, <quote>What?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/><quote><persName n="Janet,,,,," id="n0220.0005.00139.00117" reg="mostcommon:Janet,nomatch:0"><surname>Janet</surname></persName> said,</quote> continued <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>, in her clear and methodical way, <quote>that my mother was up in heaven, and would help <name n="God" type="God">God</name> hear my prayers at any rate; but if I pleased, I could come and say them by you.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>A shudder passed over Kenmure; then he turned away, and put his hands over his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>She waited for no answer, but, putting down the candlestick, <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> in her wonted careful manner, upon a chair, she began to climb upon the bed, lifting laboriously <num value="1">one</num> little rosy foot, then another, still dragging after her, with great effort, the doll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>Nestling at her father's breast, I saw her kneel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/><quote>Once my mother put her arm round me, when I said my prayers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>She made this remark, under her breath, less as a suggestion, it seemed, than as the simple statement of a fact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>Instantly I saw Kenmure's arm move, and grasp her with that strong and gentle touch of his which I had so often noticed in the studio,--a touch that seemed quiet as the approach of fate, and equally resistless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>I knew him well enough to understand that iron adoption.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>He drew her toward him, her soft hair was on his breast, she looked fearlessly into his eyes, and I could hear the little prayer proceeding, yet in so low a whisper that I could not catch <num value="1">one</num> word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>She was infinitely solemn at such times, the darling; and there was always something in her low, clear tone, through all her prayings and philosophizings, which was strangely like her mother's voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Sometimes she paused, as if to ask a <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> question, and at every answer I could see her father's arm tighten.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>The moments passed, the voices grew lower yet, the candle flickered and went out, the doll slid to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/><persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName> had drifted away upon a vaster ocean than that whose music lulled her from without,--upon that sea whose waves are dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>The night was wearing on, the lights gleamed from the anchored vessels, the water rippled serenely against the low sea-wall, the breeze blew gently in. <persName><foreName>Marian</foreName></persName>'s baby breathing grew deeper and more tranquil; and as all the sorrows of the weary earth might be imagined to exhale themselves in spring through the breath of violets, so I prayed that it might be with Kenmure's burdened heart, through hers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>By degrees the strong man's deeper respirations mingled with those of the child, and their <num value="2">two</num> separate beings seemed merged and solved into identity, as they slumbered, breast to breast, beneath the golden and quiet stars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>I passed by without awaking them, and I knew that the artist had attained his dream. </p></div1>

<head>In a wherry.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>We have a phrase in Oldport, <quote>What New-Yorkers call poverty: to be reduced to a pony phaeton.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>In consequence of a <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> gale, I am reduced to a similar state of destitution, from a sail-boat to a wherry; and, like others of the deserving poor, I have found many compensations in my humbler condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Which is the more enjoyable, rowing or sailing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>If you sail before the wind, there is the glorious vigor of the breeze that fills your sails; you get all of it you have room for, and a ship of the line could do no more; indeed, your very nearness to the water increases the excitement, since the water swirls and boils up, as it unites in your wake, and seems to clutch at the low stern of your sail-boat, and to menace the hand that guides the helm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>Or if you beat to windward, it is as if your boat climbed a liquid hill, but did it with bounding and <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> dancing, like a child; there is the plash of the lighter ripples against the bow, and the thud of the heavier waves, while the same blue water is now transformed to a cool jet of white foam over your face, and now to a dark whirlpool in your lee. Sailing gives a sense of prompt command, since by a single movement of the tiller you effect so great a change of direction or transform motion into rest; there is, therefore, a certain magic in it: but, on the other hand, there is in rowing a more direct appeal to your physical powers; you do not evade or cajole the elements by a cunning device of keel and canvas, you meet them man-fashion and subdue them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>The motion of the oars is like the strong motion of a bird's wings; to sail a boat is to ride upon an eagle, but to row is to be an eagle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>I prefer rowing,--at least till I can afford another sail-boat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>What is a good day for rowing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Almost any day that is good for living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>Living is not quite agreeable in the midst of a tornado or an equinoctial storm, neither is rowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>And so, when our condition seems most dreamy, our observing faculties are sometimes desperately on the alert, and we find afterwards, to our surprise, that we have missed nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>The best observer in the end is not he who works at the microscope or telescope most unceasingly, but he whose whole nature becomes sensitive and receptive, drinking in everything, like a sponge that <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> saturates itself with all floating vapors and odors, though it seems inert and unsuspicious until you press it and it tells the tale.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>Most men do their work out of doors and their dreaming at home; and those whose work is done at home need something like a wherry in which to dream out of doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>On a squally day, with the wind northwest, it is a dream of action, and to round yonder point against an ebbing tide makes you feel as if you were <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0220.0006.00145.00119" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; when you put about, you gallop like <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0220.0006.00145.00120" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, and the winds and waves become a cavalry escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>On other days all elements are hushed into a dream of peace, and you look out upon those once stormy distances as <persName n="Landseer,,,,," id="n0220.0006.00145.00121" reg="mostcommon:Landseer,nomatch:0"><surname>Landseer</surname></persName>'s sheep look into the mouth of the empty cannon on a dismantled fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>These are the days for revery, and your thoughts fly forth, gliding without friction over this smooth expanse; or, rather, they are like yonder pair of white butterflies that will flutter for an hour just above the glassy surface, traversing miles of distance before they alight again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>By a happy trait of our midsummer, these <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> various phases of wind and water may often be included in a single day. On <num value="3">three</num> mornings out of <num value="4">four</num> the wind blows northwest down our bay, then dies to a calm before <time value="12pm">noon</time>. After an hour or <num value="2">two</num> of perfect stillness, you see the line of blue ripple coming up from the ocean till it conquers all the paler water, and the southwest breeze sets in. This middle zone of calm is like the noonday of the <name>Romans</name>, when they feared to speak, lest the great <name n="God" type="God">god</name> Pan should be awakened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>While it lasts, a thin, aerial veil drops over the distant hills of Conanicut, then draws nearer and nearer till it seems to touch your boat, the very nearest section of space being filled with a faint disembodied blueness, like that which fills on winter days, in colder regions, the hollows of the snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Sky and sea show but gradations of the same color, and afford but modifications of the same element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>In this quietness, yonder schooner seems not so much to lie at anchor in the water as to anchor the water, so that both cease to move; and though faint ripples may come and go elsewhere on the surface, the vessel rests in this liquid island of absolute calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>For there certainly is elsewhere <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> a sort of motionless movement, as <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0220.0006.00147.00122" reg="mostcommon:Keats,nomatch:0"><surname>Keats</surname></persName> speaks of <quote>a little noiseless noise among the leaves,</quote> or as the summer clouds form and disappear without apparent wind and without prejudice to the stillness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>A man may lie in the profoundest trance and still be breathing, and the very pulsations of the life of nature, in these calm hours, are to be read in these changing tints and shadows and ripples, and in the mirage-bewildered outlines of the islands in the bay. It is this incessant shifting of relations, this perpetual substitution of fantastic for real values, this inability to trust your own eye or ear unless the mind makes its own corrections,--that gives such an inexhaustible attraction to life beside the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The seachange comes to you without your waiting to be drowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>You must recognize the working of your own imagination and allow for it. When, for instance, the sea-fog settles down around us at nightfall, it sometimes grows denser and denser till it apparently becomes more solid than the pavements of the town, or than the great globe itself; and when the fog-whistles go wailing on through all the darkened hours, they seem to be <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> signalling not so much for a lost ship as for a lost island.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>How unlike are those weird and gloomy nights to this sunny noon, when I rest my oars in this sheltered bay, where a small lagoon makes in behind <placeName reg="Coaster's Harbor Island">Coaster's Harbor Island</placeName>, and the very last breath and murmur of the ocean are left outside!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>The coming tide steals to the shore in waves so light they are a mere shade upon the surface till they break, and <num value="10">ten</num> die speechless for <num value="1">one</num> that has a voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>And even those rare voices are the very most confidential and silvery whispers in which Nature ever spoke to man; the faintest summer insect seems resolute and assured beside them; and yet it needs but an indefinite multiplication of these sounds to make up the thunder of the surf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>It is so still that I can let the wherry drift idly along the shore, and can watch the life beneath the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>The small fry cluster and evade between me and the brink; the half-translucent shrimp glides gracefully undisturbed, or glances away like a flash if you but touch the surface; the crabs waddle or burrow, the smaller species mimicking unconsciously the hue of the soft green <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> sea-weed, and the larger looking like motionless stones, covered with barnacles and decked with fringing weeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>I am acquainted with no better Darwinian than the crab; and however clumsy he may be when taken from his own element, he has a free and floating motion which is almost graceful in his own yielding and buoyant home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>It is so with all wild creatures, but especially with those of water and air. A gull is not reckoned an especially graceful bird, but yonder I see <num value="1">one</num>, snowy white, that has come to fish in this safe lagoon, and it dips and rises on its errands as lightly as a butterfly or a swallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>Beneath that neighboring causeway the water-rats run over the stones, lithe and eager and alert, the body carried low, the head raised now and then like a hound's, the tail curving gracefully and aiding the poise; now they are running to the water as if to drink, now racing for dear life along the edge, now fairly swimming, then devoting an interval to reflection, like squirrels, then again searching over a pile of sea-weed and selecting some especial tuft, which is carried, with long, sinuous leaps, to the unseen nest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>Indeed, man himself is graceful in his unconscious <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> and direct employments: the poise of a fisherman, for instance, the play of his arm, the cast of his line or net,--these take the eye as do the stealthy movements of the hunter, the fine attitudes of the wood-chopper, the grasp of the sailor on the helm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>A haystack and a boat are always picturesque objects, and so are the men who are at work to build or use them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>So is yonder stake-net, glistening in the noonday light,the innumerable meshes drooping in soft arches from the high stakes, and the line of floats stretching shoreward, like tiny stepping-stones; <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> row-boats are gathered round it, with fishermen in <rs type="color">red</rs> or <rs type="color">blue</rs> shirts, while <num value="1">one</num> white sailboat hovers near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>And I have looked down on our beach in spring, at sunset, and watched them drawing nets for the young herring, when the rough men looked as graceful as the nets they drew, and the horseman who directed might have been Redgauntlet on the <rs>Solway Sands</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>I suppose it is from this look of natural fitness that a windmill is always such an appropriate object by the sea-shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>It is simply a <num value="4">four</num>-masted schooner, stranded on a hill-top, and adapting itself <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> to a new sphere of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>It can have needed but a slight stretch of invention in some seaman to combine these lofty vans, and throw over them a few remodelled sails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>The principle of their motion is that by which a vessel beats to windward; the miller spreads or reefs his sails, like a sailor, --reducing them in a high wind to a mere <quote>pigeon-wing</quote> as it is called, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> in length, or in some cases even scudding under bare poles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>The whole structure vibrates and creaks under rapid motion, like a mast; and the angry vans, disappointed of progress, are ready to grind to powder all that comes within their grasp, as they revolve hopelessly in this sea of air.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>When the sun grows hot, I like to take refuge in a sheltered nook beside <placeName key="possibilities=86" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Goat Island</placeName> Lighthouse, where the wharf shades me, and the resonant plash of waters multiplies itself among the dark piles, increasing the delicious sense of coolness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>While the noonday bells ring <num value="12">twelve</num>, I take my rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>Round the corner of the pier the fishing-boats come gliding in, generally with a boy asleep forward, and a weary man at the helm; <num value="1">one</num> can almost fancy that the boat itself looks weary, <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> having been out since the early summer sunrise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>In contrast to this expression of labor ended, the white pleasure-boats seem but to be taking a careless stroll by water; while a skiff full of girls drifts idly along the shore, amid laughter and screaming and much aimless splash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>More resolute and business-like, the boys row their boat far up the bay; then I see a sudden gleam of white bodies, and then the boat is empty, and the surrounding water is sprinkled with black and bobbing heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>The steamboats look busier yet, as they go puffing by at short intervals, and send long waves up to my retreat; and then some schooner sails in, full of life, with a white ripple round her bows, till she suddenly rounds to, drops anchor, and is still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>Opposite me, on the landward side of the bay, the green banks slope to the water; on yonder cool piazza there is a young mother who swings her baby in the hammock, or a white-robed figure pacing beneath the trailing vines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>Peace and lotus-eating on shore; on the water, even in the stillest noon, there are life and sparkle and continual change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/><num value="1">One</num> of those fishermen whose boats have just <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> glided to their moorings is to me a far more interesting person than any of his mates, though he is perhaps the only <num value="1">one</num> among them with whom I have never yet exchanged a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>There is good reason for it; he has been deaf and dumb since boyhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>He is reported to be the boldest sailor among all these daring men; he is the last to retreat before the coming storm; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> after the storm to venture through the white and whirling channels, between dangerous ledges, to which others give a wider berth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>I do not wonder at this, for think how much of the awe and terror of the tempest must vanish if the ears be closed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>The ominous undertone of the waves on the beach and the muttering thunder pass harmless by him. How infinitely strange it must be to have the sight of danger, but not the sound!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Fancy such a deprivation in war, for instance, where it is the sounds, after all, that haunt the memory the longest; the rifle's crack, the irregular shots of skirmishers, the long roll of alarm, the roar of great guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>This man would have missed them all. Were a broadside from an enemy's gunboat to be discharged above his head, he would not hear it; <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> he would only recognize, by some jarring of his other senses, the fierce concussion of the air.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>How much deeper seems his solitude than that of any other <quote>lone fisher on the lonely sea</quote> ! Yet all such things are comparative; and while the others contrast that wave-tossed isolation with the cheeriness of home, his home is silent too. He has a wife and children; they all speak, but he hears not their prattle or their complaints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>He summons them with his fingers, as he summons the fishes, and they are equally dumb to him. Has he a special sympathy with those submerged and voiceless things?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Dunfish, in the old newspapers, were often called <quote>dumb'd fish</quote> ; and they perchance come to him as to <num value="1">one</num> of their kindred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>They may have learned, like other innocent things, to accept this defect of utterance, and even imitate it. I knew a deaf-and-dumb woman whose children spoke and heard; but while yet too young for words, they had learned that their mother was not to be reached in that way; they never cried or complained before her, and when mrZZZ would only whisper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>Her baby tenZZZ if disturbed in the night, would creep<persName n="ZZZ,,,,," id="n0220.0006.00154.00123" reg="mostcommon:ZZZ,nomatch:0"><surname>ZZZ</surname></persName> <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> touch her lips, to awaken her, but would make no noise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/><num value="1">One</num> might fancy that all men who have an agonizing sorrow or a fearful secret would be drawn by irresistible attraction into the society of the deaf and dumb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>What awful passions might not be whispered, what terror safely spoken, in the charmed circle round yonder silent boat,--a circle whose centre is a human life which has not all the susceptibilities of life, a confessional where even the priest cannot hear!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>Would it not relieve sorrow to express itself, even if unheeded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>What more could <num value="1">one</num> ask than a dumb confidant?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>and if deaf also, so much the safer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>To be sure, he would give you neither absolution nor guidance; he could render nothing in return, save a look or a clasp of the hand; nor can the most gifted or eloquent friendship do much more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Ah! but suddenly the thought occurs, suppose that the defect of hearing, as of tongue, were liable to be loosed by an over-mastering emotion, and that by startling him with your hoarded confidence you were to break the spell!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>The hint is too perilous; let us row away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>A few strokes take us to the half-submerged <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> wreck of a lime-schooner that was cut to the water's edge, by a collision in a gale, <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago. The water kindled the lime, the cable was cut, the vessel drifted ashore and sunk, still blazing, at this little beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>When I saw her, at sunset, the masts had been cut away, and the flames held possession on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Fire was working away in the cabin, like a live thing, and sometimes glared out of the hatchway; anon it clambered along the gunwale, like a school-boy playing, and the waves chased it as in play; just a flicker of flame, then a wave would reach up to overtake it; then the flames would be, or seem to be, where the water had been; and finally, as the vessel lay careened, the waves took undisturbed possession of the lower gunwale, and the flames of the upper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>So it burned that day and night; part red with fire, part black with soaking; and now <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> have made all its visible parts look dry and white, till it is hard to believe that either fire or water has ever touched it. It lies over on its bare knees, and a single knee, torn from the others, rests imploringly on the shore, as if that had worked its way to land, and perished <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> in act of thanksgiving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>At low tide, <num value="0.5">one half</num> the frame is lifted high in air, like a dead tree in the forest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Perhaps all other elements are tenderer in their dealings with what is intrusted to them than is the air. Fire, at least, destroys what it has ruined; earth is warm and loving, and it moreover conceals; water is at least caressing,--it laps the greater part of this wreck with protecting waves, covers with sea-weeds all that it can reach, and protects with incrusting shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Even beyond its grasp it tosses soft pendants of moss that twine like vine-tendrils, or sway in the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>It mellows harsh colors into beauty, and <persName n="Ruskin,,,,," id="n0220.0006.00157.00124" reg="mostcommon:Ruskin,nomatch:0"><surname>Ruskin</surname></persName> grows eloquent over the wave-washed tint of some tarry, weatherbeaten boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>But air is pitiless: it dries and stiffens all outline, and bleaches all color away, so that you can hardly tell whether these ribs belonged to a ship or an elephant; and yet there is a certain cold purity in the shapes it leaves, and the birds it sends to perch upon these timbers are a more graceful company than lobsters or fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>After all, there is something sublime in that sepulture of the <name>Parsees</name>, who erect near every village a <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> <hi rend="italics">dokhnma</hi>, or <persName n="Tower,,,,," id="n0220.0006.00158.00125" reg="mostcommon:Tower,nomatch:0"><surname>Tower</surname></persName> of Silence, upon whose summit they may bury their dead in air.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>Thus widely may <num value="1">one</num>'s thoughts wander from a summer boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>But the season for rowing is a long <num value="1">one</num>, and far outlasts in Oldport the stay of our annual guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Sometimes in autumnal mornings I glide forth over water so still, it seems as if saturated by the Indian-summer with its own indefinable calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>The distant islands lift themselves on white pedestals of mirage; the cloud-shadows rest softly on Conanicut; and what seems a similar shadow on the nearer slopes of <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Fort Adams</placeName> is in truth but a mounted battery, drilling, which soon moves and slides across the hazy hill like a cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>I hear across nearly a mile of water the faint, sharp orders and the sonorous blare of the trumpet that follows each command; the horsemen gallop and wheel; suddenly the band within the fort strikes up for guard-mounting, and I have but to shut my eyes to be carried back to warlike days that passed by,--was it centuries ago?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Meantime, I float gradually towards <placeName reg="Brenton Cove, Newport, Rhode Island" key="tgn,2193487">Brenton's Cove</placeName>; the lawns that reach to the water's edge were never so gorgeously green in any summer, and the departure of the <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> transient guests gives to these lovely places an air of cool seclusion; when fashion quits them, the imagination is ready to move in. An agreeable sense of universal ownership comes over the winter-staying mind in Oldport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>I like to keep up this little semblance of habitation on the part of our human birds of passage; it is very pleasant to me, and perhaps even pleasanter to them, that they should call these emerald slopes their own for a month or <num value="2">two</num>; but when they lock the doors in autumn, the ideal key reverts into my hands, and it is evident that they have only been <quote>tenants by the courtesy,</quote> in the fine legal phrase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Provided they stay here long enough to attend to their lawns and pay their taxes, I am better satisfied than if these estates were left to me the whole year round.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>The tide takes the boat nearer to the fort; the horsemen ride more conspicuously, with swords and trappings that glisten in the sunlight, while the white fetlocks of the horses twinkle in unison as they move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/><num value="1">One</num> troop-horse without a rider wheels and gallops with the rest, and seems to revel in the free motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>Here also the tide <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> reaches or seems to reach the very edge of the turf; and when the <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light battery</orgName> gallops this way, it is as if it were charging on my floating fortress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>Upon the other side is: adene of peace; and a fisherman sings in his boat as he examines the floats of his stake-net, hand over hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>A white gull hovers close above him, and dark <num value="1">one</num> above the horsemen, fit emblems of peace and war. The slightest sounds, the rattle of an oar, the striking of a hoof against a stone, are borne over the water to an amazing distance as if the calm bay, amid its seeming quiet, were watchful of the slightest noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>But look!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>in a moment the surface is rippled, the sky is clouded, a swift change comes over the fitful mood of the season; the water looks colder and deeper, the greensward assumes a chilly darkness, the troopers gallop away to their stables, and the fisherman rows home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>That indefinable expression which separates autumn from summer creeps almost in an instant over all. Soon, even upon this Isle of Peace, it will be winter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>Each season, as winter returns, I try in vain to comprehend this wonderful shifting of expression that touches even a thing so essentially unchanging <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> as the sea. How delicious to all the senses is the summer foam above yonder rock; in winter the foam is the same, the sparkle as radiant, the hue of the water scarcely altered; and yet the effect is, by comparison, cold, heavy, and leaden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>It is like that mysterious variation which chiefly makes the difference between <num value="1">one</num> human face and another; we call it by vague names, and cannot tell in what it lies; we only know that when expression changes, all is gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>No warmth of color, no perfection of outline can supersede those subtile influences which make <num value="1">one</num> face so winning that all human affection gravitates to its spell, and another so cold or repellent that it dwells forever in loneliness, and no passionate heart draws near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>I can fancy the ocean beating in vague despair against its shores in winter, and moaning, <quote>I am as beautiful, as restless, as untamable as ever: why are my cliffs left desolate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>I sit above it now, upon the steep bank, knee-deep in buttercups, and amid grass so lush and green that it seems to ripple and flow instead of waving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>Below lies a tiny beach, strewn with a few bits of drift-wood and some purple shells, and so sheltered by projecting walls that its wavelets plash but lightly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>A little farther out the sea breaks more roughly over submerged rocks, and the waves lift themselves, before breaking, in an indescribable way, as if each gave a glimpse through a translucent window, beyond which all ocean's depths might be clearly seen, could <num value="1">one</num> but hit the proper angle of vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>On the right side of my retreat a high wall limits the view, while close upon the left the crumbling parapet of <placeName reg="Fort Greene">Fort Greene</placeName> stands out into the foreground, its verdant scarp so relieved against the blue water <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> that each inward-bound schooner seems to sail into a cave of grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>In the middle distance is a white lighthouse, and beyond lie the round tower of old <placeName key="tgn,7013423" n="1.000 10" reg="Biloxi, Harrison, Mississippi">Fort Louis</placeName> and the soft low hills of Conanicut.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Behind me an oriole chirrups in triumph amid the birch-trees which wave around the house of the haunted window; before me a kingfisher pauses and waits, and a darting blackbird shows the scarlet on his wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>Sloops and schooners constantly come and go, careening in the wind, their white sails taking, if remote enough, a vague blue mantle from the delicate air. Sail-boats glide in the distance,--each a mere white wing of canvas, --or coming nearer, and glancing suddenly into the cove, are put as suddenly on the other tack, and almost in an instant seem far away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>There is to-day such a live sparkle on the water, such a luminous freshness on the grass, that it seems, as is so often the case in early <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, as if all history were a dream, and the whole earth were but the creation of a summer's day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>If <persName n="Petrarch,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00199.00225" reg="mostcommon:Petrarch,nomatch:0"><surname>Petrarch</surname></persName> still knows and feels the consummate beauty of these earthly things, it may seem to him some repayment for the sorrows of a lifetime <pb id="p.200" n="200"/> that <num value="1">one</num> reader, after all this lapse of years, should choose his sonnets to match this grass, these blossoms, and the soft lapse of these blue waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>Yet any longer or more continuous poem would be out of place to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>I fancy that this narrow cove prescribes the proper limits of a sonnet;. and when I count the lines of ripple within yonder projecting wall, there proves to be room for just <num value="14">fourteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>Nature meets our whims with such little fitnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>The words which build these delicate structures of <persName n="Petrarch,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00200.00226" reg="mostcommon:Petrarch,nomatch:0"><surname>Petrarch</surname></persName>'s are as soft and fine and close-textured as the sands upon this tiny beach, and their monotone, if such it be, is the monotone of the neighboring ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>Is it not possible, by bringing such a book into the open air, to separate it from the grimness of commentators, and bring it back to life and light and <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>The beautiful earth is the same as when this poetry and passion were new; there is the same sunlight, the same blue water and green grass; yonder pleasure-boat might bear, for aught we know, the friends and lovers of <measure n="5centuries" type="date">five centuries</measure> ago; <persName n="Petrarch,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00200.00227" reg="mostcommon:Petrarch,nomatch:0"><surname>Petrarch</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> might be there, with <persName n="Boccaccio,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00200.00228" reg="mostcommon:Boccaccio,nomatch:0"><surname>Boccaccio</surname></persName> and Fiammetta as comrades, and with <persName n="Chaucer,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00200.00229" reg="mostcommon:Chaucer,nomatch:0"><surname>Chaucer</surname></persName> as <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> their stranger guest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>It bears, at. any rate, if I know its voyagers, eyes as lustrous, voices as sweet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>With the world thus young, beauty eternal, fancy free, why should these delicious <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00201.00230" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> pages exist but to be tortured into grammatical examples?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>Is there no reward to be imagined for a delightful book that can match <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00201.00231" reg="mostcommon:Browning,nomatch:0"><surname>Browning</surname></persName>'s fantastic burial of a tedious <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>When it has sufficiently basked in sunshine, and been cooled in pure salt air, when it has bathed in heaped clover, and been scented, page by page, with melilot, cannot its beauty once more blossom, and its buried loves revive?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>Emboldened by such influences, at least let me translate a sonnet, and see if anything is left after the sweet <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00201.00232" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> syllables are gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>Before this continent was discovered, before <name>English</name> literature existed, when <persName n="Chaucer,,,,," id="n0220.0008.00201.00233" reg="mostcommon:Chaucer,nomatch:0"><surname>Chaucer</surname></persName> was a child, these words were written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>Yet they are to-day as fresh and perfect as these laburnum-blossoms that droop above my head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>And as the variable and uncertain air comes freighted with clover-scent from yonder field, so floats through these long centuries a breath of fragrance, the memory of <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>Elsewhere the high-road has usurped its place, and you have the privilege of the path without its charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>In remoter places the path grows wilder, and has ramifications striking boldly across the peninsula through rough moorland and among great ledges of rock, where you may ramble for hours, out of sight of all but some sportsman with his gun, or some truant-boy with dripping water-lilies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>There is always a charm to me in the inexplicable windings of these wayward tracks; yet I like the path best where it is nearest the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>A footpath cannot be quite spoiled, so long as it remains such; you can make a road a mere avenue for fast horses or showy women, but this humbler track keeps its simplicity, and if a queen comes walking through it, she comes but as a village maid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>So much of loitering and indolence and impulse have gone to its formation, that all which is stiff and military has been left out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>It is this unintentional adaptation that makes a footpath so indestructible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>Instead of striking across the natural lines, it conforms to them, nestles into the hollow, skirts the precipice, avoids the morass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>An unconscious landscape-gardener, it seeks the most convenient course, never doubting that grace will follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>When a footpath falls thus unobtrusively into its place, all natural forces seem to sympathize <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> with it, and help it to fulfil its destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>Once make a well-defined track through a wood, and presently the overflowing brooks seek it for a channel, the obstructed winds draw through it, the fox and woodchuck travel by it, the catbird and robin build near it, the bee and swallow make a highroad of its convenient thoroughfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>In winter the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> snows mark it with a white line; as you wander through you hear the blue-jay's cry, and see the hurrying flight of the sparrow; the graceful outlines of the leafless bushes are revealed, and the clinging bird's-nests, <quote>leaves that do not fall,</quote> give happy memories of summer homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>Thus Nature meets man half-way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>The paths of the wild forest and of the rural neighborhood are not at all the same thing; indeed, a <quote>spotted trail,</quote> marked only by the woodman's axe-marks on the trees, is not a footpath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>The dark brown pellucid water sleeps between banks of softest moss; white stars of twin-flowers creep close to the brink, delicate sprays of dewberry trail over it, and the emerald tips of drooping leaves forever tantalize the still surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>The analogy is as unmistakable as that between the scorching heats of summer and the shrill cry of the cicada.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>The narrower the path, the more domestic and familiar it seems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>The railroad may represent the capitalist or the government; the high-road indicates what the surveyor or the county commissioners thought best; but the footpath shows what the people needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Its associations are with beauty and humble life,--the boy with his dog, the little girl with her fagots, the pedler with his pack; cheery companions they are or ought to be. <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="couplet"><l>Jog on, jog on the footpath way,</l> <l>And merrily hent the stile-a:</l> <l>A merry heart goes all the day,</l> <l>Your sad <num value="1">one</num> tires in a mile-a.</l></lg></quote> The footpath takes you across the farms and <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> behind the houses; you are admitted to the family secrets and form a personal acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>There is a healthy vigor in the mind of the boy who would like of all things to be lost in the woods, to build a fire out of doors, and sleep under a tree or in a haystack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>Civilization is tiresome and enfeebling, unless we occasionally give it the relish of a little outlawry, and approach, in imagination at least, the zest of a gypsy life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>The records of pedestrian journeys, the <hi rend="italics">Wanderjahre</hi> and memoirs of good-for-nothings, and all the delightful <name>German</name> forest literature,--these belong to the footpath side of our nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>The thoughts that the railway affords us are dusty thoughts; we ask the news, read the journals, question our neighbor, and wish to know what is going on because we are a part of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>This whole interior is traversed by a network of footpaths, rarely passable for a wagon, and not always for a horse, but enabling the pedestrian to go from any <num value="1">one</num> of these villages to any other, in a line almost direct, and always under an agreeable shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>In the little <pb id="p.252" n="252"/> inn at the former village there used to hang an old map of this whole forest region, giving a chart of some of these paths, which were said to date back to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlement of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>Those woods have been lately devastated; but when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> knew that region, it was as good as any <name>German</name> forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>Often we stepped almost from the edge of the sea into some gap in the woods; there seemed hardly more than a rabbit-track, yet presently we met some wayfarer who had crossed the <name>Cape</name> by it. A piny dell gave some vista of the broad sea we were leaving, and an opening in the woods displayed another blue sea-line before; the encountering breezes interchanged odor of berrybush and scent of brine; penetrating farther among oaks and chestnuts, we come upon some little cottage, quaint and sheltered as any <persName n="Spenser,,,,," id="n0220.0010.00252.00290" reg="mostcommon:Spenser,nomatch:0"><surname>Spenser</surname></persName> drew; it was built on no high-road, and turned <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> its vine-clad gable away from even the footpath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>Then the ground rose and we were surprised by a breeze from a new quarter; perhaps we climbed trees to look for landmarks, and saw only, still farther in the woods, some great cliff of granite or the derrick of an unseen quarry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/><measure n="3miles" type="distance">Three miles</measure> inland, as I remember, we found the hearthstones of a vanished settlement; then we passed a swamp with cardinal-flowers; then a cathedral of noble pines, topped with crow's-nests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>If we had not gone astray by this time, we presently emerged on Dogtown Common, an elevated table-land, overspread with great boulders as with houses, and encircled with a girdle of green woods and an outer girdle of blue sea. I know of nothing more wild than that gray waste of boulders; it is a natural Salisbury Plain, of which icebergs and ocean-currents were the <name>Druidic</name> builders; in that multitude of couchant monsters there seems a sense of suspended life; you feel as if they must speak and answer to each other in the silent nights, but by day only the wandering sea-birds seek them, on their way across the <name>Cape</name>, and the sweet-bay and green fern imbed them in a softer <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> and deeper setting as the years go by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>I recall another footpath near <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester, Massachusetts</placeName>; it leads up from the low meadows into the wildest region of all that vicinity, <placeName reg="Tatesset Hill">Tatesset Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>The familiar birds and butterflies linger below with them, and in the upper and more sacred depths the wood-thrush chants his litany and the brown mountain butterflies hover among the scented vines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>Farther on, the deep, cool forest was luxurious with plumy ferns; we trod on moss-covered roots, finding the emerald steps so soft we scarcely knew that we were ascending; every breath was aromatic; there seemed infinite healing in every fragrant drop that fell upon our necks from the cedar boughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>It seemed an impertinence to ask him to come out of his <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> dream and offer us dinner; but his instincts of hospitality failed not, and the red-shirted guide was sent to the camp, which was, it seemed, on the other side of the lake, to prepare our meal, while we bathed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>I am thus particular in speaking of the dinner, not only because such is the custom of travellers, but also because it was the occasion of an interlude which I shall never forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>As we were undressing for our bath upon the lonely island, where the soft, pale water almost lapped our feet, and the deep, wooded hills made a great amphitheatre for the lake, our host bethought himself of something neglected in his instructions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>All day and all night we rode between <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> distant prairie-fires, pillars of evening light and of morning cloud, while sometimes the low grass would burn to the very edge of the trail, so that we had to hold our breath as we galloped through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>Parties of armed Missourians were sometimes seen over the prairie swells, so that we had to mount guard at nightfall; Free-State emigrants, fleeing from persecution, continually met us; and we sometimes saw parties of wandering <placeName key="tgn,7014508" n="1.000 30" reg="sioux city, woodbury, iowa">Sioux</placeName>, or passed their great irregular huts and houses of worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> desolate prairie summit on which an Indian boy sat motionless on horseback; his bare red legs clung closely to the white sides of his horse; a gorgeous sunset was unrolled behind him, and he might have seemed the last of his race, just departing for the hunting-grounds of the blest.
