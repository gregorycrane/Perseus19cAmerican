<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>My grandfather owned large tracts of land in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and many slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>My Grandmother <persName n="Fontaine,,La,,," id="n0026.0001.00003.00010" reg="default:Fontaine,La,,,"><foreName>La</foreName> <surname>Fontaine</surname></persName> was a cousin of <persName n="Price,General,Sterling,,," id="n0026.0001.00003.00011" reg="default:Price,Sterling,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Sterling</foreName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>, of Mexican War and Confederate fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>When my father and mother were married, <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> grandfather gave my mother, as a wedding-present, a colored man, his wife, and <num value="2">two</num> children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Soon after my birth, my Grandfather <persName n="Cunningham,,,,," id="n0026.0001.00004.00012" reg="nearbymention:Cunningham,John,M.,,"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>, having liberated his slaves in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, removed to <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Illinois</placeName>, and became urgent for my father to come to him to look after him in his declining years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Full of filial affection, father decided that he could not resist Grandfather <persName n="Cunningham,,,,," id="n0026.0001.00004.00013" reg="nearbymention:Cunningham,John,M.,,"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>'s appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>He therefore disposed of his business, liberated his slaves, and returned to <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Illinois</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The country was new and population sparse; but my father, full of courage, made every effort to overcome all difficulties and hew his way to success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In his efforts he was ably seconded by my self-denying, loyal, and courageous mother, whose brilliant mind enabled her to devise ways and means of meeting every emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In a brief time my father became <num value="1">one</num> of the most popular men in that locality, our home then being at <placeName reg="Marion, Williamson, Illinois" key="tgn,2028967">Marion, Williamson County</placeName>, where we resided during my childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Schools were very few, and we had only the advantages of itinerant teachers, who came and went periodically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Father and mother were so anxious for us children to be educated that they lost no opportunity of employing these teachers, as well as taking advantage of every other source of education for us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Illinois</placeName> at that time was not so advanced in civilization as the far Western States of to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The wealth of the nation was not what it is at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The earlier settlers of the border States and Territories of the <rs>West</rs> had not the modern inventions and improvements which have in later years so facilitated their settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The pioneers of the whole belt of country south of the <orgName n="Ohio and Mississippi Railroad" type="railroad">Ohio and Mississippi Railroad</orgName> had accomplished wonders in the matter of clearing away the dense forests, draining the swamp-lands of that locality, making large farms, and building up towns and villages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Still, under the methods then employed, it was a slow process, and they were far behind in matters of education and <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Free schools were unknown, much prejudice existing against the education of the masses, through the influence of the <name>Southerners</name>, who were greatly in the majority among the settlers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>People from the slave States opposed education on the ground that they could not <quote>keep the niggers down if they had larnin&lsquo;.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They considered illiteracy their surest bulwark for the protection of their cherished institution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>With but <num value="1">one</num> railroad &mdash; the <rs>Illinois Central</rs>--which runs transversely through the whole length of the <rs>State</rs>, communication and intercourse with the world was limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Agriculture was the chief resource of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Every child was, to a certain extent, a producer, and children had to work part of each year before they had reached their teens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>From early spring until the crops were in and the grain harvested the girls and boys had to assist in putting in the wheat and small grain that must be sown in the fall, and in gathering and garnering the corn and other products, and all without the aid of machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There were no <persName n="McCormick,,,,," id="n0026.0001.00005.00014" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,nomatch:0"><surname>McCormick</surname></persName> reapers and harvesters, or <persName n="Hough,,,,," id="n0026.0001.00005.00015" reg="mostcommon:Hough,nomatch:0"><surname>Hough</surname></persName>'s ploughs and planters; but with oxen, mules, and horses men and boys ploughed all day long, while the women and weaker or aged men followed in the furrows, dropping the seeds by hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The harvesting was done with cradle, scythe, or sickle, while men followed the skilful cradler, and by hand bound the bundles of rye, oats, and wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Others followed and shocked them in the fields till they had passed through the <quote>sweat</quote> and were ready for the thrashing-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Here was heard the stamp of many horses' feet, tramping out the grain on the smooth yard prepared for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The <rs>Ruths</rs> and <rs>Naomis</rs> were many, who gleaned the fields carefully after the men, to be sure that, as nearly as possible, every grain should be saved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Besides the gleaning, the women and girls worked prodigiously to brew, bake, and cook for the harvesters, who went into the fields at <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The women had to rise long before that hour to give them their breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><pb id="p.6" n="6"/> At <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> came lunch, at <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> a dinner composed of every variety of meat and vegetables at their command, and at <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> supper for all the men who worked together in the harvest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><num value="4">Four</num> meals a day cost these faithful women aching limbs and much fatigue that would now dishearten housewives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In addition, the young girls had to assist in carding, spinning, weaving, and making the clothes for the family, including those of the men. Ready-made clothes were little known even to well-to-do people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Such clothes were regarded with great contempt, as being made of <quote>factory material</quote> of inferior quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><quote>Very few pieces of factory cloth are a yard wide and all wool,</quote> would be said depreciatingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>After all this work, it was not an unusual thing to hear the thrifty housewives say: <quote>I have done very little this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I have made only so many yards of jeans, blankets, flannel, cotton cloth, carpeting, etc. Not by &mdash; so many yards as last year.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Unless they could show an incredible number of yards of material manufactured, dyed, and then made into clothing they had not accomplished the full measure of their ambition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It goes without saying that these women were more industrious, abler managers of domestic affairs, and better wives and mothers than a majority of the wives and mothers of this era. The multiplication of labor-saving machines and the introduction of luxuries which were unknown to our mothers have begotten a spirit of indifference and lassitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Mothers now rarely feel it incumbent upon them to enlighten their marriageable daughters on the duties of wifehood and motherhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Girls marry now expecting only indulgence from their husbands, and if children are born to them trained nurses are called to relieve the mothers of the care and responsibility of their babies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They are more interested in the preservation of their girlish figures after childbirth than in the welfare of their offspring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Household duties devolved absolutely upon the female <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> members of the family, it being effeminate for any male member to perform any labor of a domestic nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Many stalwart sons have stood idly by while their delicate mothers, wives, or sisters exposed themselves in inclement weather, milking the cows and performing the hardships which were considered woman's work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>On the other hand, the men did not hesitate to insist upon the same mothers, wives, and sisters trudging up and down the rows, dropping and covering the corn with a hoe, or following the reapers, turning and raking the grain as it fell before the sickle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The blessed wives of pioneers fulfilled to the letter their marriage vows of devotion in <quote>sickness and in health, for richer or poorer.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They were handmaidens when the family were in health, nurses and ofttimes physicians when any of the family were ill; even undertakers when death visited a household, unless, forsooth, that office was performed by some friend or neighbor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/><persName n="Roosevelt,Ex-President,,,," id="n0026.0001.00007.00016" reg="mostcommon:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,:1"><roleName n="Ex-President">Ex-President</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName>'s heart would have been delighted with the large families which were the rule, and not the exception, in those days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I have often heard mothers say they had no more trouble in caring for half a dozen children than for <num value="1">one</num> because, in either case, it took all their time to look after the home and baby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>When there were more than <num value="1">one</num> the children took care of each other, and they could only give all their time under any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>These children were reared by their own parents, and not by indifferent, ill-mannered, unscrupulous servants, whose influence is so baneful in many of the homes of to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>They were taught self-denial, and to help themselves and their brothers and sisters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>I doubt seriously if there is now half the happiness among the people generally that there was in those pioneer days, when all worked hard, and all enjoyed the holidays and merrymakings together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Old and young joined in the sports and pastimes with an abandon of enthusiasm which springs from healthy minds and bodies that have not been satiated by too much leisure and overindulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><pb id="p.8" n="8"/> </p> 
<p>Amusements were often preceded by the accomplishment of something useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>If a piece of land was to be cleared, not infrequently the proprietor invited all his neighbors to give him a day of their services in felling and rolling the logs that he could not possibly handle by himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>If he had the money to pay men to assist him he could rarely get them, because there were few in the country who could afford to leave their own work to engage in the service of anybody for the low wages paid in localities where slavery did not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>However, where persons had anything like a favorable standing in the community in which they lived neighbors would readily accept their invitation, and give an honest hard day's work to help each other with their clearing, harvesting, husking, or house-raising. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>A few days before he was ready for the work the person desiring this assistance would mount a horse, and ride for miles from house to house, asking old and young men to come on a certain day to help him; and as the good wife had a very important part to play in preparing the feast for the occasion, the husband usually bore his wife's compliments to the female members of his friends' families and an invitation to them to come also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>This invitation, these good women knew, meant that the wife wanted some assistance in her work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The women held quilting-parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>A patchwork quilt was generally prepared thus for quilting: The lining was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> laced in frames made for the purpose, the cotton laid smoothly over the lining, then the patchwork spread over and basted closely all around the edges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Then, with chalk and a line, the women marked out the designs for the quilting, fan-shaped figures being the most popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>After quilting <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> rows of fans, according to the size, the side frames were loosened, the quilted part rolled up, and the frame again fastened by placing a peg through the holes in the frames, thus allowing the quilters to reach another row nearer the centre, repeating the process until the whole of the quilt was quilted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><pb id="p.9" n="9"/> </p> 
<p>Among so many there were often drones, or unskilled needlewomen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>These went into the kitchen and helped the housewife cook the dinner and supper, an indispensable feature of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The young people many times remained for dancing or games, according to the scruples of the persons giving the entertainment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The <quote>corn-huskings</quote> and <quote>apple-parings</quote> were evening affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>A company of young men and women, in an evening from <num value="6">six</num> to <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, would husk a <num value="100">hundred</num> bushels of corn, and peel many bushels of apples, peaches, or pears, for drying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The young men paired off, as they are ever wont to do, each inviting the girl he fancied to sit beside him. They talked, they sang, and merrily chaffed each other as they rapidly husked the corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Every time a red ear was found a scuffle ensued, as the finder claimed a kiss from his partner, who, with becoming modesty, resisted the attempts to kiss her. All enjoyed the fun at the expense of the blushing girl, who was always captured, and could do nothing but surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The <quote>fruit-parings</quote> were characterized by the same jollity and good humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>After the work was over everything would be set aside, and the merriest dances indulged in, lasting till the wee small hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>These. indefatigable people were as bright and ready for the fun at <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> in the morning as if they had neither worked nor danced a step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They would go to their homes and take up their duties the following day regardless of the fact that they had hardly slept an hour of the previous <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Toward the evening of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day, however, they began to lag, and followed with avidity <placeName reg="Franklin, Johnson, Indiana" key="tgn,2031887">Franklin</placeName>'s maxim, <quote>Early to bed,</quote> etc. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The harvesting was done in much the same way: neighbors going from farm to farm, joining forces and despatching the work with great rapidity, the lads having many a frolic with the lassies in the light of the witching harvest-moon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>In case of intermarriage between members of the more wealthy families a series of parties and banquets would be <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> organized, and for a whole week following the wedding the neighbors would go from house to house, on horseback and in every conceivable vehicle, to attend the parties which were given for miles around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>They gave themselves up to feasting, dancing, and merrymaking, troops of them staying all night at <num value="1">one</num> house and the next day going to another, until they had finished their round of festivities. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/><dateStruct value="-01-01"><occasion>New Year's Day</occasion></dateStruct> was celebrated generally by dinner-giving, much feasting, and dancing-parties in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The custom of making ceremonious calls on <dateStruct value="-01-01"><occasion>New Year's Day</occasion></dateStruct> did not obtain in this country until later years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Usually the evening was taken up with social affairs as a finale to the festivities of the preceding holiday week. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/><placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>'s Birthday had its annual celebration by banquets, which were great events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Eloquent and patriotic speeches were made in response to the toasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Thrilling stories were told of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0026.0001.00010.00018" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:3"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> and the battles of the <rs>Revolutionary War</rs>. A grand ball invariably followed the banquets, either at the mansion of some private individual or in a hall, and was attended by the eligible society people of every community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Extensive preparations, consuming much time of the most prominent members of society, were made for these celebrations of the natal day of the <rs>Father</rs> of His Country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Training Day, which usually occurred in midsummer, was anticipated with the wildest enthusiasm and outbursts of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>They imagined that annual meetings were quite sufficient to cultivate the proper military spirit and keep aglow the fires of patriotism in the hearts of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>They were thoroughly imbued with the belief that-<quote>To fight <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/><rs type="color">Red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs>, and <rs type="color">blue</rs> calico was displayed in great profusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Flags and bunting not being so plentiful as they are to-day, the ingenious people used every symbol of love of country which they could conceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Those truly patriotic people were unable to remember correctly the arrangement of the colors in Old Glory-so familiar to every child of this age of patriotic instruction, flag drill, and with the emblem of freedom waving above every schoolhouse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>All the treasures which had been preserved in families whose antecedents had ever been in the service in any capacity were brought forth and displayed on that day. The <quote>sword of <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>,</quote> and the rusty blades used in other engagements were brightened up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Mother was almost overcome, <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> as she read page after page of father's graphic stories of all that had taken place since he left us; of his disappointments and successes; of the legions of seekers after gold from every country on the globe; of his longing to return home and his tender messages to us children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>No such long intervals between his letters again occurred, as the mails from <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> subsequently came by sea around the <name>Horn</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It was an important appointment, on account of the passage by Congress of the <quote>Bit act,</quote> which meant that actual settlers inside the radius of the district of which <placeName reg="Shawneetown, Gallatin, Illinois" key="tgn,2030128">Shawneetown</placeName> was the headquarters could enter <measure n="160acres" type="area">one hundred and sixty acres</measure> of land, at <measure n="12.5cents" type="currency">twelve and one-half cents</measure> per acre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>As the time was limited for such entries, it was necessary for father to assume the duties of the office as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We removed to <placeName reg="Shawneetown, Gallatin, Illinois" key="tgn,2030128">Shawneetown</placeName>, and father opened the <orgName n="Land Office" type="office">land office</orgName> on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> floor of the large house he was able to secure as a residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The question as to where I was to be sent to school was soon settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>It was then, and still is, <num value="1">one</num> of the best schools in the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>In the community where I had always lived there were few <persName n="Catholics,,,,," id="n0026.0002.00029.00065" reg="mostcommon:Catholics,nomatch:0"><surname>Catholics</surname></persName>, and no churches, monks, nuns, or priests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>I was totally ignorant of the ceremonies and symbols of the church and of the significance of the costumes worn by the priests and nuns, and had consequently much to learn that was not in the curriculum of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>I was in my <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> year, but had had more experience in the realities of life than <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> many older girls on account of being the eldest of a large family, for whom mother and I had to care during father's absence in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>, and subsequently in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>For once I was silent, as I could not have spoken had my life depended upon it. The bars and grates of the doors and windows suggested incarceration to my unsophisticated mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>In answer to father's ring the angelic face of a sister appeared at the little grated panel in the door, and, upon father's announcing his name, she quickly unlocked the door and invited us into the parlor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Under the influence of her gentle manner and the immaculate appointment of the room, together with the bright wood-fire in the fireplace, I began to feel less frightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>After seating us, the sister withdrew to call the sister superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>In a few moments <persName><roleName n="Sister">Sister</roleName> <foreName>Isabella</foreName></persName> came in. She was short and very stout, had a jolly face, and the cordial greeting so important in a mother superior.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Memory brings back incidents in the lives of these slaves that are as vivid as if I had witnessed them yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Nearly, if not all, of the negroes belonged to the slaveholders in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Among them was <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName></persName>, the overseer's best hand on the big farm connected with the convent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> was never the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/><placeName reg="Franklin, Missouri, United States" key="tgn,1002384">Franklin County</placeName> was an important county in that part of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>With untiring energy, much thought, and patient care, everything belonging to the animal and vegetable kingdoms, or to domestic and household art, was exhibited in the pleasant rivalry for premiums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Quick as a flash <persName n="Logan,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0003.00052.00142" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Logan</surname></persName> paused in his pleading and seized upon the incident to the profit of his bitterly prosecuted client, insisting that the innocent lamb had come to offer itself as a sacrifice to save the life of the unfortunate prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>His touching appeal so impressed the jury that the young man was acquitted, while the judge announced the verdict in open court, betraying much emotion, the whole audience and the prisoner weeping like children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>In the evening lawyers, judges, and citizens congregated together, sometimes to play poker, sometimes to smoke and talk; discussing always every phase of the politics of the day. It was a curious fact that the men of that time were, without exception, thoroughly posted on political questions, and while perhaps very partisan, they knew all about political <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> affairs, and espoused <num value="1">one</num> side or the other with enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>An <quote>independent</quote> was unknown, and our modern <quote><num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-party men</quote> would have had little encouragement from these intensely earnest people, whose politics were as much a part of their faith as their religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Sometimes they carried their intensity so far that they came to blows over questions or individuals whom equally earnest opponents were espousing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>On such occasions men fought each other like tigers: pounding, biting, cutting, and sometimes shooting each other fatally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Duelling was never recognized in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, as it was farther south, but the equally barbarous practice of assaulting each other with knives, bludgeons, brickbats, pound weights, and any instrument of destruction at hand was freely indulged in. There was seldom a term of the court when there was not a murder case on the docket and always cases of assault and battery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>The judges and lawyers were obliged to travel in buggies or stages from <num value="1">one</num> place of holding court to another, and any overland conveyance which they could obtain was gladly used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>The distance was always from <num value="25">twenty-five</num> to <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure>, over the worst of roads, through the wind and rain of the spring and the bitter blasts of the <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>My husband always insisted upon my accompanying him whenever it was possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>The taverns were invariably small and poorly furnished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>The court-rooms were circumscribed and densely crowded with people who looked upon the terms of court as their <num value="1">one</num> opportunity to hear the arguments in litigation and the often eloquent speeches of the attorneys, together with the political discussions that usually occupied some hour during court week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Everybody's affairs were talked of. All the gossip of the country was retailed to the visitors who attended court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>It was a luxury to the many who seldom saw newspapers and the monotony of whose lives was only relieved by these occasional recreations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/><pb id="p.54" n="54"/> </p> 
<p>We remember how some of the lawyers were obliged to carry their law-books from court to court, as they could not depend upon finding authorities in every town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Law libraries were few and incomplete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/><num value="1">One</num> lawyer always carried a green-baize bag, in which were the books he was constantly quoting when he had a case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>He would bring the bag into court every morning, and lay it on the bench or a table beside him, to show that he was well fortified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>He was an Irishman, and would parry with his <name>Irish</name> wit the fun poked at him by his brother lawyers, always concluding with: <quote>I've the authorities with me, will ye mind that, my fellows?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Many of the cases were most amusing and difficult of adjustment, as, for instance: a Mr. B, Sr., married the daughter of a widow who had property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>His son, <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> B, Jr., married his wife's mother; that is, he married the mother of his stepmother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>Both mother and daughter had children, and got into litigation to establish the relationship of these children, their inheritance, and the division of the property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>The father being son-in-law to his own son, his son's wife being his mother-in-law, and at the same time his daughter-in-law, while the father's young children were half brothers and sisters to their grandfather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>The son's children were his grandchildren, and also his brothers and sisters in law, because they were his wife's half brothers and sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>For years this case was on the docket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Argument after argument was heard by judge and jury without deciding the status of this much-mixed-up family, until the residue of the estate was absorbed by costs and attorneys' fees. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The digging and delving into facts and authorities, together with the earnest work that was unavoidable to attain success in any case, wonderfully developed these naturally able men. As a result, a galaxy of illustrious men were produced who have made an impress upon the nation as well as the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The scene of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0003.00054.00143" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s early career was farther north in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>The central and northern part of the <rs>State</rs> <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> had its own bar of remarkable men whom I knew in later days. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>The presidential campaign of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> was <num value="1">one</num> of intense interest, far in excess of that of any preceding campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The Kansas and <placeName key="tgn,7007525" n="1.000 4" reg="nebraska">Nebraska</placeName> trouble had brought out most conspicuously the subtlety of the slaveholder of the <rs>South</rs> and the no-longer-to-be-concealed fact that, in order to extend slavery into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and to perpetuate that institution, they would not hesitate to overthrow every opposition, even to the destruction of the government and the disruption of the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Scarcely a man in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Illinois</placeName> was so ignorant as not to think he knew all about the important principles involved in the contest, and thought it was necessary for him to be on hand on all occasions when political affairs were discussed or in any way under consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Hence, at all public gatherings and meetings multitudes assembled, men and women flocking to a political demonstration as they would to a camp-meeting or to a circus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Before the hour for speaking or joint discussions these occasions were enlivened by processions led by bands of music, when often unique banners and devices were displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Among these, not infrequently, was a pyramid of seats arranged on long wagons, upon which would be seated young girls representing every State in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>The girls were dressed in white with <rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs>, and <rs type="color">blue</rs> ribbons flying from their waists and shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>A goddess of liberty was placed in the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Her robe was made of the flag; <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> stripes in the skirt and a waist of blue studded with stars of <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs>, while in her hand she carried a flag or sceptre, thus impersonating <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>These spectacles awakened the wildest enthusiasm, and the people became so absorbed that the girl representing a State immediately became its champion, together with all its interests and <quote>isms,</quote> whatever they happened to be. Heated controversies often arose between <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> before the fair <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> representatives had laid aside the printed name of the <name>States</name> they represented. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Barbecues which would have done credit to the feasts of the days of <name>Roman</name> greatness were usually a feature of these political gatherings, whole beeves, sheep, and pigs being cooked to feed the multitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>After butchering and quartering the animal, long pits were dug and filled with logs of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>These logs were set on fire, and kept burning until the pits were quite full of live coals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Across these were placed iron bars, and on these bars were laid the quarters or halves of the animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>By a system of turning over and over, the huge pieces of meat were cooked to perfection, while chicken and other fowl were daintily broiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Potatoes, both white and sweet, and green corn were roasted, and with the delicious bread baked in <quote><placeName reg="Dutch, Braxton, West Virginia" key="tgn,2302045">Dutch</placeName> ovens</quote> of private families a feast fit for the gods was the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>In the groves of trees, always an indispensable adjunct for a barbecue, long tables were constructed, upon which were spread the viands, and around these the multitudes gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>After enjoying the great feast, toasts and speeches were in order, and some as brilliant speeches as ever followed any banquet of the <name>Gridiron</name> or the <rs>Clover Club</rs> have echoed through the trees above these crude tables, eliciting shouts of applause from appreciative hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>The crowd then congregated around the speaker's stand, erected sufficiently far away from the table and pits to keep the noise of clearing away of dishes and the last of the feast from disturbing either speaker or audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>Then began in earnest the business of the day in the discussion of political topics. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> was very greatly in the majority in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Illinois</placeName>, and controlled all the party-machinery resources, having done so for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>It was not surprising, therefore, that the local as well as the national nominees were elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The campaign of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> aroused the lethargic as never before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>In the subsequent contests for the <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> election of the legislators who were to vote for <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> senator, there was even greater excitement, and more bitter controversy than had characterized the presidential campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Lying as <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Illinois</placeName> does-between <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>-and having then a population strongly sympathizing with the slave-holders, the questions that had arisen would not down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Popular sovereignty, the motto of the <rs>State</rs>, under the leadership of <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0003.00057.00144" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, the champion of States' rights, had thoroughly impressed itself upon a large majority of the citizens south of the <orgName n="Ohio and Mississippi Railroad" type="railroad">Ohio and Mississippi Railroad</orgName> without it ever occurring to them to what extent this theory could be carried, or whither they were drifting in advocating this dangerous doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of the most earnest advocates of popular sovereignty, not even <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0003.00057.00145" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, who claimed the authorship of the bill, ever had a disloyal thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>They would not for <num value="1">one</num> moment have sustained the theory that, acting under its tenets, a State had the right to secede; and yet secession was the logical sequence and result of the agitation of the question and theory of popular sovereignty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>As I look back over the past, I am glad that my husband insisted upon taking me with him, whenever it was possible, wherever he went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Therefore I was fortunate enough to witness the stirring scenes of those eventful days which prepared me for the memorable ones preceding and during the <rs>Civil War</rs>.. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>At the <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> election in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> my husband was elected to the <orgName n="Illinois Legislature" type="legislature">Illinois legislature</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>It was an elegant affair, notwithstanding the fact that the decorations of that time were very unlike the richer displays of the present day. I remember at each end of the <rs>Van Buren</rs> mirror, with its filigree railing of gold bronze, that formerly adorned the centre of the table on all state occasions, there were <num value="2">two</num> tall gilt baskets in which were <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> arranged plaster-of-Paris fruits painted in very unnaturally bright colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>The variety included oranges, apples, peaches, grapes, etc.,with artificial leaves here and there among the mimic fruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>I remember, too, the historic china, with the red band and coat of arms of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>The gold-<rs n="plated spoons" type="product">plated spoons</rs>, solid-silver service, and cut glass, though familiar to me since from frequent dinings at the executive mansion, have never looked half so gorgeous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>Though delighted over the invitation, for days before the affair I was wholly engrossed by the momentous questions of what I should wear; what I should do when I got there; and how I should ever command ideas enough to carry me safely through a long state dinner and not become a bore to my escort &mdash; that was the rub. Who that unfortunate individual was to be it was impossible to find out. Was he to be a personage of agreeable manners, or arrogant, pedantic, and probably patronizing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>Any of these latter characteristics would make me so unhappy that I should be unable to appear to any advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>Then if he betrayed in &mdash; the slightest degree that he was bored or really endured me because there was no escape I should have suffered intensely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>I was proud of my husband, whose handsome face and brilliant conversation would charm all about him, but for myself I had many misgivings and visions of hours of agony. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>However, the desire to see the pomp and display of a state dinner and to hear the conversation of the distinguished guests I expected to meet at such a ceremonious affair overcame every scruple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of those hot, dusty days in that semitropical climate when man and beast panted for breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>At an early hour the people began to arrive, and before <time value="12pm">noon</time>--the hour at which <persName n="Logan,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0004.00093.00475" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Logan</surname></persName> was due &mdash; a surging throng of human beings filled the public square, impatiently watching the road over which he was to drive into town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>Getting into a buggy early that morning, I drove out on the road leading to <placeName key="tgn,7013549" n="1.000 8" reg="carbondale, jackson, illinois">Carbondale</placeName>, a station on the <orgName n="Illinois Central Railroad" type="railroad">Illinois Central Railroad</orgName>, to meet my husband, who was to come to <placeName key="tgn,2028967" n="1.000 5" reg="marion, williamson, illinois">Marion</placeName> in a carriage that had been sent to bring him from the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>It was a distance of <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,2028967" n="1.000 5" reg="marion, williamson, illinois">Marion</placeName></placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013549" n="1.000 8" reg="carbondale, jackson, illinois">Carbondale</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>I kept driving but did not meet him. Fearing something was wrong, I continued my journey to <placeName key="tgn,7013549" n="1.000 8" reg="carbondale, jackson, illinois">Carbondale</placeName>, to learn that the <rs>Eastern</rs> train on the <orgName n="Ohio and Mississippi Railroad" type="railroad">Ohio and Mississippi Railroad</orgName>, and the <orgName n="Illinois Central Railroad" type="railroad">Illinois Central Railroad</orgName> upon which he was to come had missed connection at the crossing at <persName n="Odin,,,,," id="n0026.0004.00093.00476" reg="mostcommon:Odin,nomatch:0"><surname>Odin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>There was no possible chance for him to get down until <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> the following morning; hence he could not speak until the following day. Appreciating the disappointment it would be to the people of <placeName key="tgn,2028967" n="1.000 5" reg="marion, williamson, illinois">Marion</placeName>, knowing their inflammable natures, <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> and that many men among them had probably been drinking and were desperate by that time, I knew it was no time to trust a messenger with the simple message that my husband had been detained, but would come the following day, at which time they should return to hear what he had to say. I also wished to consult with the trusted friends we had as to the temper of the people when such numbers were together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>I therefore took a fresh horse and drove back to <placeName key="tgn,2028967" n="1.000 5" reg="marion, williamson, illinois">Marion</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>Many eyes were still peering down the long road, and the moment they spied me coming alone they could hardly wait for me to reach the centre of the square when they gathered around the buggy, stopped the horse, and eagerly cried out: <quote>Where is <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n0026.0004.00094.00477" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><surname>Logan</surname></persName>?</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>Heartsick, frightened, weary with the <measure n="40mile" type="distance">forty-mile</measure> drive, and choking with anxiety and discouragement over the seeming madness of the men, I could only beg them to be quiet; to call <persName n="Swindell,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0004.00094.00478" reg="mostcommon:Swindell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Swindell</surname></persName>, the sheriff, that I might explain to him, and that he should stand up in the buggy and tell them all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>Very soon <persName n="Swindell,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0004.00094.00479" reg="mostcommon:Swindell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Swindell</surname></persName>, a tall, distinguished-looking man, with a fine face, blue eyes as gentle as any woman's, and at the same time full of moral courage and coolness, came to me and I briefly told him the facts: that it was purely an accident occasioned by a delay on the then badly managed road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>He stood up on the seat of the buggy and addressed the surging multitude, appealing to their manhood, their sense of right and propriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>He besought them to go home and go to sleep; to quiet down, and to come back by <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> on the following day when <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n0026.0004.00094.00480" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><surname>Logan</surname></persName>, their leader and best friend, would be there and would tell them everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>He told them that, as they valued their liberty, their homes, and their country, it behooved them to follow <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> him wherever he should go; that he had more at stake than they had; that all that he or they held dear was in the balance against anarchy and rebellion; that they and their posterity would reap the consequences of their sowing; that they knew that his all was at stake with them, and that he, personally, was ready to join <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n0026.0004.00095.00481" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><surname>Logan</surname></persName> with all he had in whatever move <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n0026.0004.00095.00482" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><surname>Logan</surname></persName> said would bring peace to the distracted country, without which they could expect nothing for themselves or their children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>Many were deeply affected and did as he suggested, departing for their homes; others manifested an ugly spirit and continued their wrangling and dissipation, making threats, and in many ways causing me great solicitude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>When the crowd had dispersed I drove to my father's home, and, after consulting with our friends, I decided to take another horse and drive back to <placeName key="tgn,7013549" n="1.000 8" reg="carbondale, jackson, illinois">Carbondale</placeName> to meet my husband, so that I could have a chance to tell him everything &mdash; the exact position of every man in the town, and of many who were in the country; to be able to give him the benefit of what we had done; and suggest to him what we considered the safest line in which he could move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>It was a bright moonlight night, and, as it was before the day of tramps, I was not afraid to go alone, although I should not arrive in <placeName key="tgn,7013549" n="1.000 8" reg="carbondale, jackson, illinois">Carbondale</placeName> before <time value="12am">midnight</time>. In those days the produce was freighted across the country to the railroad in large wagons, forming sometimes quite a train of <num value="10">ten</num> or a dozen together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>The drivers camped at the side of the road, parking their teams, sleeping in their wagons, building fires to cook their food and make their coffee &mdash; the men sometimes sitting up late, playing cards and telling stories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>If <num value="1">one</num> was alone on the highway and had to pass <num value="1">one</num> of these camps, they presented rather a weird appearance, and in times of such excitement it was quite enough to startle the nerves of a weak woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>Driving along the road with a dense forest on either side, and seeing that at the sound of the approaching vehicle some of the men walked out toward the road as if they intended <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> to stop the horse, or at least to know who was passing at so late an hour; fearing that they might not recognize me, and greatly frightened, my heart fluttered like a leaf in a gale of wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>Fortunately they knew me and also my horse, and they called out: <quote>Where are you going &mdash; has anything happened?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>I halted long enough to tell them, and they expressed regret that I had undertaken so lonely a journey and that none of them could leave their teams, as they were then returning to <placeName key="tgn,2028967" n="1.000 5" reg="marion, williamson, illinois">Marion</placeName> with valuable freight, or they would not let me continue alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>I bade them good night and hurried on, congratulating myself upon my good fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>I reached <placeName key="tgn,7013549" n="1.000 8" reg="carbondale, jackson, illinois">Carbondale</placeName> <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> before <persName n="Logan,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0004.00096.00483" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Logan</surname></persName> arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>It was <time value="2am">two o'clock A. M.</time> before his train halted at the <rs>Illinois Central</rs> depot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>We were both weary and half-sick from fatigue, anxiety, and loss of sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>We went to the hotel, and, as quickly as he could get away from the many who had been waiting for him, we retired to our room to rest till <time value="7am">seven in the morning</time>, when we must go to <placeName key="tgn,2028967" n="1.000 5" reg="marion, williamson, illinois">Marion</placeName> to meet the crowd that would be waiting impatiently for him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>Events of such grave character had happened since we parted early in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, that it seemed ages since we had been together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>The unknown was before us. A more or less reckless people surrounded us, all of them unreasonable in their expectation of what <persName n="Logan,Mister,,,," id="n0026.0004.00096.00484" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Logan</surname></persName> could do; some going so far as to aver that he could have secured the adoption of the <name>Crittenden</name> compromise if he had tried, forgetting that <persName n="Crittenden,,,,," id="n0026.0004.00096.00485" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,John,J.,,:3"><surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0026.0004.00096.00486" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, <persName n="Gushing,,Caleb,,," id="n0026.0004.00096.00487" reg="default:Gushing,Caleb,,,"><foreName>Caleb</foreName> <surname>Gushing</surname></persName>, and the oldest and ablest men in the nation had been unable to get anything done in the way of compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>His former closest friends were the worst secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>Our families were much divided, and we felt that we could trust only each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>He had resolved to enter the army for the war with no alternative but to leave me to do the best I could; and, at the same time, to try to sustain my father and mother (my eldest <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> brother, as before stated, having joined the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>) and those who might be left alone should their husbands, fathers, or brothers volunteer to go with him. Not knowing what fate awaited us, we drove over the familiar road with sad hearts, feeling it was our only opportunity to be alone, or to talk over the plans for the present or the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>As we approached <placeName key="tgn,2028967" n="1.000 5" reg="marion, williamson, illinois">Marion</placeName> the people began to gather about the buggy, cheering and shouting their welcome to <persName n="Logan,General,,,," id="n0026.0004.00097.00488" reg="nearbymention:Logan,John,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Logan</surname></persName>; crowding so near to grasp his hand that it was almost impossible for the horse we were driving to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>He assured them he would speak to them at <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>. It was then almost noon, and he had to go home long enough to remove the dust of travel from his clothing and to get his dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>The very crowd was enough to alarm <num value="1">one</num>; they were so excited-seemingly on the verge of violent demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>When the hour arrived, he came to me and begged me on no account to go into the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>He felt that there might be trouble, and assured me he should be unnerved if he thought I was in the crowd, should mob violence seize the half-crazed people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>I gave my promise, with a mental reservation not to keep it; as I determined to be near him whatever happened, thinking by a disguise in dress and keeping behind him (as he was to speak standing in a wagon in the public square) that I could watch the actions of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> persons who had made threats of a personal assault upon him should he declare for war or attempt to raise a regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>I felt sure I could at least scream should they move toward him with evil intent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>I waited until he was gone and soon followed, keeping out of his sight, but where I could see him and every movement made toward him. I trembled in every limb, my head swam, and I dared not speak to any <num value="1">one</num>, though surrounded by acquaintances who once were friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>He mounted the wagon, and, after waving salutation to the throng who surrounded him, he began to speak in a voice so clear and with such <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> volume that every person, even those farthest from him on the outside of the crowd, could hear him distinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>In a few moments a deathlike stillness prevailed; the most turbulent spirit in the crowd was as quiet as the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>You could hear only his sonorous voice as he with great deliberation pictured the situation of affairs, the inevitable consequences of rebellion against the <rs>Government</rs> should the theory of secession prevail; telling them at what cost of blood and treasure the republic had been established, and how certainly liberty would be forfeited and anarchy reign were the <rs>Union</rs> once dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Step by step he led them on for nearly <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, intensity and earnestness depicted in every lineament of his face, his bright black eyes gleaming with emotion, every gesture emphasizing the truthfulness of his remarks, and his earnestness carrying conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>The effect upon his hearers was magical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>They were swayed by his eloquence until they fairly re-echoed his utterances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Toward the close he said: <quote>The time has come when a man must be for or against his country, not for or against his State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>How long could <num value="1">one</num> State stand up against another, or <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> States against others?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/></p> 
<p>There was an old fifer, <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> tall, and very large in proportion, in the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>It is needless to add that through my own tears I witnessed the most affecting scene that had ever occurred in that or any other town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>The year <dateStruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></dateStruct> was the beginning of the revolutionary action on the part of strikers.
