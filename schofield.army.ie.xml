<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>We removed to <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1843-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct>, and, after a short stay in <placeName reg="Bristol, Bristol, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013454">Bristol</placeName>, my father made a new home for his family in <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName>, where he began his missionary work by founding the <orgName n="Baptist Church 1" type="church">First Baptist Church</orgName> of that place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In all my childhood and youth I had what I regard as the best possible opportunities for education, in excellent public schools where the rudiments of English were <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> taught with great thoroughness, in a fair amount of all kinds of manly sports, and in hard work, mainly on the farm and in building a new home, which left no time and little inclination for any kind of mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>At <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> of age I spent <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> in surveying public lands in the wilds of <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Wisconsin</placeName>, and at <num value="17">seventeen</num> taught district school in the little town of <placeName reg="Oneco, Stephenson, Illinois" key="tgn,2029489">Oneco</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>By that time I had chosen the law as my profession, and was working hard to complete the preparatory studies at my own expense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The winter school term in <placeName reg="Oneco, Stephenson, Illinois" key="tgn,2029489">Oneco</placeName> having closed early in the spring of <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, I returned to <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName> and resumed my struggle with Latin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Then an unforeseen event turned the course of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The young man who had been appointed to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> from our district only a year or <num value="2">two</num> before had failed to continue his course in the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Thus a vacancy occurred just at the close of <persName n="Turner,Mister,Thomas,J.,," id="n0131.0001.00002.00010" reg="default:Turner,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>'s term in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>There was no time for applications or for consultation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He must select another candidate to enter the following <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, or leave the place to be filled by his successor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Fortunately for me, <persName n="Turner,Mister,,,," id="n0131.0001.00002.00011" reg="nearbymention:Turner,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>, as <num value="1">one</num> of the public-school directors, had been present at an examination where the subject with which I had to deal was mathematical; if he had caught me at Latin, the result must have been fatal to all my prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Besides, <persName n="Turner,Mister,,,," id="n0131.0001.00002.00012" reg="nearbymention:Turner,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName> had heard from his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName></persName> of the stamina I had shown in the public land-surveying expedition; and also from my father of my determination to get a good education before beginning the study of law. So he brought me a cadet appointment when he came home, and said he believed a boy with that record could get through <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, the training there being, in his opinion, a good preparation for the study of law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The little savings from all my past work had been invested in a piece of land which was sold to fit me out <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> for my journey to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, including some inexpensive visits en route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I reported at the <name>Academy</name> on <dateStruct value="1849-06-01"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, with less than <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> in my pocket, which I conscientiously deposited with the treasurer, as required by the regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>My reception was of the most satisfactory character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><persName n="Carlin,,William,P.,," id="n0131.0001.00003.00013" reg="default:Carlin,William,P.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Carlin</surname></persName> of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> class, and <persName n="Garber,,Hezekiah,H.,," id="n0131.0001.00003.00014" reg="default:Garber,Hezekiah,H.,,"><foreName>Hezekiah</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Garber</surname></persName> of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, both from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, found me out very soon after I reported, took me under their protection in a brotherly way, and gave me some timely advice&mdash;not to take too seriously any little fun the <q direct="unspecified">men</q> might make of my blue dress-coat and fancy gilt buttons, or anything like that; but I never experienced anything even approaching to hazing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>My rather mature appearance may have had something to do with the respect generally paid me. It was true I was only <measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure> and <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> old, as recorded in the register, but my experience may have had some visible effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I was assigned to a room in the old <placeName reg="South Barracks">South Barracks</placeName>, which were demolished the next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>My room-mates were <persName n="Walker,,Henry,H.,," id="n0131.0001.00003.00015" reg="default:Walker,Henry,H.,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> and <persName n="Chambiiss,,John,R.,," id="n0131.0001.00003.00016" reg="default:Chambiiss,John,R.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Chambiiss</surname></persName>, <num value="2">two</num> charming fellows from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We had hardly learned each other's names when <num value="1">one</num> of them said something about the <q direct="unspecified">blank <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName></q>; but instantly, seeing something that might perhaps have appeared like Southern blood in my face, added, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">You</hi> are not a <hi rend="italics">Yankee</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I replied, <q direct="unspecified">Yes; I am from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><q direct="unspecified">Oh,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">we don't call Western men <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In that remark I found my mission at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, as in after life, to be, as far as possible, a peacemaker between the hostile sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If the great <rs>West</rs> could have been heard, and its more dispassionate voice heeded, possibly peace might have been preserved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>My experience at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> did not differ in many particulars from the general average of cadet life, but a few incidents may be worthy of special mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>My <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> experience in camp was comparatively limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> summer I was on guard only once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Then the corporal of the grand rounds tried to charge over my post without giving the countersign, because I had not challenged promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We crossed bayonets, but I proved too strong for him, and he gave it up, to the great indignation of the officer of the day, who had ordered him to charge, and who threatened to report me, but did not. That night I slept on the ground outside the guard tents, and caught cold, from which my eyes became badly inflamed, and I was laid up in the hospital during the remainder of the encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>On that account I had a hard struggle with my studies the next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>While sitting on the east porch of the hospital in the afternoon, I attracted the kind attention of <persName n="Scott,General,Winfield,,," id="n0131.0001.00004.00017" reg="default:Scott,Winfield,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Winfield</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, who became from that time a real friend, and did me a great service some years later.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In our <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-class encampment, when corporal of the guard, I had a little misunderstanding <num value="1">one</num> night with the sentinel on post along <placeName key="tgn,2335197" n="1.000 1" reg="fort clinton, rockland, new york">Fort Clinton</placeName> ditch, which was then nearly filled by a growth of bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The sentinel tore the breast of my shell-jacket with the point of his bayonet, and I tumbled him over backward into the ditch and ruined his musket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But I quickly helped him out, and gave him my musket in place of his, with ample apologies for my thoughtless act. We parted, as I thought, in the best of feeling; but many years later, a colonel in the army told me that story, as an illustration of the erroneous treatment sometimes accorded to sentinels in his time, and I was thus compelled to tell him I was that same corporal, to convince him that he had been mistaken as to the real character of the treatment he had received.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>That <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-class year I lived in the old <placeName reg="North Barracks">North Barracks</placeName>, <num value="4">four</num> of us in <num value="1">one</num> room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There, under the malign influence of <num value="2">two</num> men who were afterward found deficient, I contracted the bad habit of fastening a blanket against <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> the window after <q direct="unspecified">taps,</q> so that no <num value="1">one</num> outside could see us <q direct="unspecified">burning the midnight oil</q> over pipes and cards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The corps of cadets was not as much disciplined in our day as it is now. If it had been, I doubt if I should have graduated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>As it was, I got <num value="196">196</num> demerits out of a possible <num value="201">200 one</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><num value="1">One</num> more <q direct="unspecified">smoking in quarters</q> would have been too much for me. I protest now, after this long experience, that nothing else at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> was either so enjoyable or so beneficial to me as smoking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I knew little and cared less about the different corps of the army, or about the value of class standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I became quite indignant when a distinguished friend rather reproved me for not trying to graduate higher&mdash;perhaps in part from a guilty conscience, for it occurred just after we had graduated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I devoted only a fraction of the study hours to the academic course&mdash;generally an hour, or <num value="1.5">one and a half</num>, to each lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But I never intentionally neglected any of my studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It simply seemed to me that a great part of my time could be better employed in getting the education I desired by the study of law, history, rhetoric, and general literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Even now I think these latter studies have proved about as useful to me as what I learned of the art and science of war; and they are essential to a good general education, no less in the army than in civil life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I have long thought it would be a great improvement in the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName> if a much broader course could be given to those young men who come there with the necessary preparation, while not excluding those comparatively young boys who have only elementary education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>There is too much of the <q direct="unspecified">cast-iron</q> in this government of law under which we live, but <q direct="unspecified">mild steel</q> will take its place in time, no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The conditions and interests of so vast a country and people are too varied to be wisely subjected to rigid rules.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But I must not be misunderstood as disparaging the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>As it was, and is now, there is, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> I believe, nothing equal to it anywhere in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Its methods of developing the reasoning faculties and habits of independent thought are the best ever devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> <hi rend="italics">training</hi> of the mind is practically perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Its general discipline is excellent and indispensable in the military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Even in civil life something like it would be highly beneficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>In my case that discipline was even more needed than anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The hardest lesson I had to learn was to submit my will and opinions to those of an accidental superior in rank who, I imagined, was my inferior in other things, and it took me many years to learn it. Nothing is more absolutely indispensable to a good soldier than perfect subordination and zealous service to him whom the national will may have made the official superior for the time being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I now think it <num value="1">one</num> of the most important lessons of my own experience that, while I had no difficulty whatever in securing perfect subordination and obedience in a large public school when I was only <measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure> old, or ever afterward in any body of troops, from a squad of cadets up to an army of men, others did not find it by any means so easy to discipline me. What I needed to learn was not so much how to command as how to obey.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>My observation of others has also taught much the same lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Too early independence and exercise of authority seem to beget some degree of disrespect for the authority of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>I once knew a young majorgen-eral who, in his zeal to prevent what he believed to be the improper application of some public funds, assumed to himself the action which lawfully belonged to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The question thus raised was considered paramount to that of the proper use of the funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The young officer lost his point, and got a well-merited rebuke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>But it is not to be expected that complete military education can be obtained without complete military experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The rules of subordination and obedience <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> <hi rend="italics">in</hi> an army are so simple that everybody learns them with the utmost ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>But the relations between the army and its administrative head, and with the civil power, are by no means so simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>When a too confident soldier rubs up against them, he learns what <q direct="unspecified">military</q> discipline really means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It sometimes takes a civilian to <q direct="unspecified">teach a soldier his place</q> in the government of a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>If a soldier desires that his own better judgment shall control military policy, he must take care not to let it become known that the judgment is his. If he can contrive to let that wise policy be invented by the more responsible head, it will surely be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It should never be suspected by anybody that there is any difference of opinion between the soldier and his civil chief; and nobody, not even the chief, will ever find it out if the soldier does not tell it. The highest quality attributed to <persName n="Moltke,,Von,,," id="n0131.0001.00007.00018" reg="default:Moltke,Von,,,"><foreName>Von</foreName> <surname>Moltke</surname></persName> was his ability to make it clearly understood by the <rs>Emperor</rs> and by all the world that the <rs>Emperor</rs> himself commanded the <name>German</name> army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>My constitutional habit once led me into a very foolish exploit at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>A discussion arose as to the possibility of going to New York and back without danger of being caught, and I explained the plan I had worked out by which it could be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>(I will not explain what the plan was, lest some other foolish boy should try it.) I was promptly challenged to undertake it for a high wager, and that challenge overcame any scruple I may have had. I cared nothing for a brief visit to New York, and had only <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> in money which <persName n="Bonaparte,,Jerome,N.,," id="n0131.0001.00007.00019" reg="default:Bonaparte,Jerome,N.,,"><foreName>Jerome</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> loaned me to pay my way. But I went to the city and back, in perfect safety, between the <num value="2">two</num> roll-calls I had to attend that day. <persName n="Havens,,Old Benny,,," id="n0131.0001.00007.00020" reg="default:Havens,Old Benny,,,"><foreName>Old Benny</foreName> <surname>Havens</surname></persName> of blessed memory rowed me across the river to <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0131.0001.00007.00021" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s, and the <rs type="place">Cold Spring</rs> ferryman back to the <rs type="place">Point</rs> a few minutes before evening parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I walked across the plain in full view of the crowd of officers and ladies, and appeared in <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> ranks at roll-call, as innocent as anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It is true my up-train did not stop at <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0131.0001.00008.00022" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s or <placeName reg="Cold Spring, Putnam, New York" key="tgn,7013630">Cold Spring</placeName>, but the conductor, upon a hint as to the necessity of the case, kindly slacked the speed of the express so that I could jump off from the rear platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In due time I repaid <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0131.0001.00008.00023" reg="nearbymention:Bonaparte,Jerome,N.,,"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> the borrowed <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure>, but the wager was never paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The only other bet I made at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> was on <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0131.0001.00008.00024" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:1"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s election; but that was in the interest of a Yankee who was not on speaking terms with the <rs>Southerner</rs> who offered the wager.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>I have never had any disposition to wager anything on chance, but have always had an irresistible inclination to back my own skill whenever it has been challenged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The <num value="1">one</num> thing most to be condemned in war is the leaving to chance anything which by due diligence might be foreseen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>In the preparations for defense, especially, there is no longer any need that anything be left to chance or uncertainty.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I attended the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>-class regularly every Sunday after I went to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, and rejoiced greatly in that opportunity to hear the <name>Scriptures</name> expounded by the learned doctor of divinity of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I had never doubted for a moment that every word of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> was divinely inspired, for my father himself had told me it was. But I always had a curious desire to know the reason of things; and, more than that, some of my fellows were inclined to be a little skeptical, and I wanted the reasons with which I could overwhelm their unworthy doubts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>So I ventured to ask the professor <num value="1">one</num> Sunday what was the evidence of divine inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>He answered only what my father had before told me, that it was <q direct="unspecified">internal evidence</q>; but my youthful mind had not yet perceived that very clearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Hence I ventured very modestly and timidly to indicate my need of some light that would enable me to see. The learned doctor did not vouchsafe a word in reply, but the look of amazement and scorn he gave me for my display of ignorance <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> sealed my lips on that subject forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I have never since ventured to ask anybody any questions on that subject, but have studied it out for myself as well as I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Soon after that the doctor preached a sermon in which he denounced skepticism in his own vigorous terms, and consigned to perdition all the great teachers of heresy, of whom he mentioned the names&mdash;before unheard, I am sure, by the great majority of cadets, though their works were to be found in the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> and all other public libraries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>I never looked into any of those books, though other cadets told me that they, at his suggestion, had sought there for the information the good doctor had refused to give us. I have never, even to this day, been willing to read or listen to what seemed to me irreverent words, even though they might be intended to convey ideas not very different from my own. It has seemed to me that a man ought to speak with reverence of the religion taught him in his childhood and believed by his fellow-men, or else keep his philosophical thoughts, however profound, to himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Another sermon of the good doctor of divinity, which I did not happen to hear, on the <name>Mosaic</name> history of creation, contained, as stated to me, a denunciation of the <q direct="unspecified"><name n="God" type="God">God</name>-hating geologists.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>That offended me, for I had, in common with all other cadets, learned greatly to admire and respect our professor of geology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>So I did not go to the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>-class any more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>But the professor of ethics continued to drive his fine fast horse, much the best <num value="1">one</num> on the <rs type="place">Point</rs>, and I believe the best I had ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Hence he continued to enjoy my esteem, though perhaps he did not know it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Near the beginning of the last year of my cadet life an event occurred which very nearly proved fatal to my prospects, and I have often wondered that it did not have some effect on my hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>But, singularly enough, I never had a moment's doubt or anxiety as to the final <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It was then the custom for candidates to report on <dateStruct value="-06-1"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="1">1</day></dateStruct>, or within the next few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They were organized into sections, and placed under the instruction of cadets selected from the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> class to prepare them, as far as possible, for examination about the middle of the month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>I was given charge of a section in arithmetic, and have never in all my life discharged my duty with more conscientious fidelity than I drilled those boys in the subject with which I was familiar, and in teaching which I had had some experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>We had gone over the entire course upon which they were to be examined, and all were well prepared except <num value="2">two</num> who seemed hopelessly deficient upon a few subjects which they had been unable to comprehend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Not willing to omit the last possible effort in behalf of those <num value="2">two</num> boys, I took them to the blackboard and devoted the last <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> before the bugle-call to a final effort to prepare them for the ordeal they must face the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>While I was thus employed several of my classmates came into the room, and began talking to the other candidates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Though their presence annoyed me, it did not interfere with my work; so I kept on intently with the <num value="2">two</num> young boys until the bugle sounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>I then went to my quarters without paying any attention to the interruption, or knowing anything of the character of what had occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>But <num value="1">one</num> of the candidates, perhaps by way of excuse for his failure, wrote to his parents some account of the <q direct="unspecified">deviltry</q> in which my classmates had indulged that day. That report found its way to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and was soon followed by an order to the commandant of cadets to investigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The facts were found fully to exonerate me from any participation in or countenance of the deviltry, except that I did not stop it; and showed that I had faithfully done my duty in teaching the candidates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>After this investigation was over, I was called upon to answer for <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> my own conduct; and, the names of my guilty classmates being unknown to the candidates, I was also held responsible for their conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>I answered by averring and showing, as I believed, my own innocence of all that had been done, except my neglect of duty in tolerating such a proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>My conscience was so clear of any intentional wrong that I had no anxiety about the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>But in due time came an order from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> dismissing me from the academy without trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>That, I believe, shocked me a little; but the sense of injustice was too strong in my mind to permit of a doubt that it would be righted when the truth was known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>I proposed to go straight to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and lay the facts before the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Then I realized for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time what it meant to have friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>All my classmates and many other cadets came forward with letters to their congressmen, and many of them to senators whom they happened to know, and other influential men in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>So I carried with me a great bundle of letters setting forth my virtues in terms which might have filled the breast of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n0131.0001.00011.00025" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> with pride.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>There was no public man in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> whom I had ever seen, and probably no <num value="1">one</num> who had ever heard of me, except the few in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> who knew of my alleged bad conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> would not even see me until I was at last presented to him by an officer of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Then he offered me his forefinger to shake, but he could give me no encouragement whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>This was after I had been in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> several weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>My congressman, <persName n="Campbell,Mister,,,," id="n0131.0001.00011.00026" reg="mostcommon:Campbell,J.,A.,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, who had succeeded <persName n="Turner,Mister,,,," id="n0131.0001.00011.00027" reg="nearbymention:Turner,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>, and several others received me kindly, read my letters, and promised to see the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, which no doubt they did, though without any apparent effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The only result was the impossible suggestion that if I would give the names of my guilty classmates I might be let off. I had made an early call upon <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> the <q direct="unspecified">Little Giant,</q> <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0131.0001.00012.00028" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, to whom I had no letter, and whom I had never met; had introduced myself as a <q direct="unspecified">citizen of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName></q> in trouble; and had told my story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>He said he was not on good terms with that administration, and preferred not to go near the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> if it could be avoided, but if it proved necessary to let him know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Hence, after all else failed, including my personal appeal, which I had waited so long to make, I told <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0131.0001.00012.00029" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> all that had occurred, and suggested that there was nothing left but to <q direct="unspecified">put in the reserve,</q> as the tacticians call it. He replied: <q direct="unspecified">Come up in the morning, and we will go to see about it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>On our way to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> the next morning, the senator said, <q direct="unspecified">I don't know that I can do anything with this&mdash;Whig administration</q>; but he assured me all should be made right in the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>That seemed to me the kind of man I had looked for in vain up to that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>I waited in the anteroom only a few minutes, when the great senator came out with a genial smile on his face, shook me warmly by the hand, and bade me good-by, saying: <q direct="unspecified">It is all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>You can go back to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> has given me his promise.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>I need not go into the details of the long and tedious formalities through which the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s promise was finally fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>It was enough for me that my powerful friend had secured the promise that, upon proof of the facts as I had stated them, I should be fully exonerated and restored to the academy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>I returned to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, and went through the long forms of a <orgName n="Inquiry Court" type="court">court of inquiry</orgName>, a court martial, and the waiting for the final action of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, all occupying some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, diligently attending to my military and academic duties, and trying hard to obey all the regulations (except as to smoking), never for a moment doubting the final result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>That lesson taught me that innocence and justice sometimes need powerful backing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Implicit trust in <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> does not <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> seem to justify any neglect to employ also the biggest battalions and the heaviest guns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>During all that time I continued to live with my old room-<persName n="McPherson,Mate,James,B.,," id="n0131.0001.00013.00030" reg="default:McPherson,James,B.,,"><roleName n="Mate">mate</roleName>, <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>McPherson</surname></persName>, in a tower room and an adjoining bedroom, which <address><street n="La place">La</street></address> <persName n="Livingston,,Rhett,L.,," id="n0131.0001.00013.00031" reg="default:Livingston,Rhett,L.,,"><foreName>Rhett</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Livingston</surname></persName> also shared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>I had been corporal, <rs type="role" n="Sergeant">sergeant</rs>, and lieutenant up to the time of my dismissal; hence the duties of private were a little difficult, and I found it hard to avoid demerits; but with some help from our kind-hearted inspecting officer, <persName n="Cogswell,,Milton,,," id="n0131.0001.00013.00032" reg="default:Cogswell,Milton,,,"><foreName>Milton</foreName> <surname>Cogswell</surname></persName>,&mdash;bless his memory!&mdash; I contrived to get off with <num value="196">196</num> demerits in a possible <num value="200">200</num> that last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>In a mild way, <persName n="McPherson,,,,," id="n0131.0001.00013.00033" reg="nearbymention:McPherson,James,B.,,"><surname>McPherson</surname></persName> was also a little under a cloud at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>He had been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> captain of the battalion and squad marcher of the class at engineering drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>In this latter capacity he also had committed the offense of not reporting some of the class for indulging in unauthorized sport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The offense was not so grave as mine, and, besides, his military record was very much better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>So he was let off with a large demerit mark and a sort of honorable retirement to the office of quartermaster of the battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I still think, as I did then, that <persName n="McPherson,,,,," id="n0131.0001.00013.00034" reg="nearbymention:McPherson,James,B.,,"><surname>McPherson</surname></persName>'s punishment was the more appropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>He also seemed to need the aid of tobacco in his studies.

He was a beardless youth, only <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> high and <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> old when he entered the academy; yet he was so inconsiderate as to keep ahead of me all the time in everything but tactics, and that was of no consequence to him, for he was not destined to command troops in the field, while, as it turned out, I was. It has always seemed to me a little strange that the <num value="1">one</num> branch which <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> I never expected to use afterward was the only study in which I graduated at the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Perhaps <persName n="McPherson,,,,," id="n0131.0001.00014.00038" reg="nearbymention:McPherson,James,B.,,"><surname>McPherson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Craighill,,,,," id="n0131.0001.00014.00039" reg="nearbymention:Craighill,William,P.,,"><surname>Craighill</surname></persName> thought, as I did, that it made no difference where I stood in tactics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Among all the tactical officers of our time, <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,John,M.,," id="n0131.0001.00014.00040" reg="default:Jones,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> was esteemed the most accomplished soldier and tactician, and the most rigid but just and impartial disciplinarian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It had been my good fortune to enjoy his instruction while I was private, <rs type="role" n="Corporal">corporal</rs>, sergeant, and lieutenant, and I fully shared with others in the above high estimate of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>I even flattered myself that my soldierly conduct in all that time had not escaped his favorable notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>When my case was before the <orgName n="Inquiry Court" type="court">court of inquiry</orgName> in the summer of <dateStruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct>, the professors who had been called to testify gave me a high character as a faithful, diligent student.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>When <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0131.0001.00014.00041" reg="nearbymention:Jones,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> was called to testify as to my character as a soldier, he replied that, in his opinion, it was very bad!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>While I was not a little surprised and disappointed at that revelation of the truth from the lips of the superior whom I so highly respected, and did not doubt for a moment his better judgment, I could not be unmindful of the fact that the other tactical officers did not know me so well, and had not so high a reputation as <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0131.0001.00014.00042" reg="nearbymention:Jones,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> in respect to discipline; and I felt at liberty to avail myself, in my own interest, of the opportunity suggested by this reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Hence, when, after my complete restoration to the academy in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, I found my demerits accumulating with alarming rapidity, I applied for and obtained a transfer to <orgName type="company" n="Company C">Company C</orgName>, where I would be under <persName n="Cogswell,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0131.0001.00014.00043" reg="nearbymention:Cogswell,Milton,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Cogswell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Vincent,Cadet,Captain,,," id="n0131.0001.00014.00044" reg="default:Vincent,Captain,,,"><roleName n="Cadet">Cadet</roleName> <foreName>Captain</foreName> <surname>Vincent</surname></persName>, my beloved classmate, who had cordially invited me to share his room in barracks.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>If you will place yourself in my hands and do what I decide is honorable and right, I will be your friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Tell me all about it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>My condition was accepted without reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>My friend, whose home was in a distant city, had been in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> some weeks, and had spent all the money he had and all he could borrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>He was on the eve of negotiating a further loan from a well-known banker when the son of that banker, who had met my friend about town, told his father the plain truth about my friend's habits and his probable value as a debtor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The negotiation was ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>My friend had become a stranger in a strange land, without the means to stay there any longer or to go home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It was a desperate case&mdash; <num value="1">one</num> which could not be relieved by anything less than the blood of the young <q direct="unspecified">villain</q> who had told his father that <q direct="unspecified">infamous</q>&mdash;truth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>I replied: <q direct="unspecified">Yes, that is a bad case; we will have to fix that up. How are you off at <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> home?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>He said the <q direct="unspecified">old man</q> had plenty of money, but had sent him enough to come home once or twice before, and would not send any more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Upon further inquiry, I found that my friend's hotel bill and expenses home would amount to a little less than the sum I had just drawn on my pay account up to date; so I handed him the money, saying that he could return it when convenient, and his <q direct="unspecified">honor</q> was fully satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>I never afterward heard anything from him about that money, and my tailor had to wait a little longer for his pay; but I had done my duty, as I understood it, under the code of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>I saw that friend once afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He went into the army in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, accidentally shot himself, and died miserably on the march, an old musket-barrel, placed there by my order, marking his grave by the wayside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Several times in after years I found it necessary, in order to save time, to repeat to great lawyers the exact words of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>; but their habit was much the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>It is seldom wise to burden the memory with those things which you have only to open a book to find out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>He said if it was a question of statute law he would have to examine the books, but if only a question of common law he could make that as well as anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>But I had nothing better to do for a time in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and when I got out I did not find my memory <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> half so much overloaded with law as my blood was with malarial poison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Luckily, I got rid of the poison after a while, but held on to the law, and I never found it did me any harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>In fact, I would advise all young officers to acquire as much of it as they can.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>A new policy was soon inaugurated, which had for its object to establish a complete line of posts across the <rs>State</rs> from <persName n="Jupiter,,,,," id="n0131.0002.00023.00062" reg="mostcommon:Jupiter,nomatch:0"><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Lake Okeechobee, Florida, United States" key="tgn,7013860">Lake Okeechobee</placeName>, and thence westward to the gulf, so as more securely to confine the <name>Seminoles</name> within the <placeName reg="Everglade, Sutter, California" key="tgn,2320357">Everglade</placeName> region, although, so far as I know, nobody then wanted the use of that more northern part of this vast territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step was to reopen the old military road from the mouth of <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Indian River</placeName> across to the <placeName key="tgn,1125609" n="1.000 1" reg="kissimmee, florida, united states">Kissimmee River</placeName>, and thence to <placeName key="tgn,7013974" n="1.000 23" reg="tampa, hillsborough, florida">Tampa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Being the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-2">second lieutenant</rs> of the single company, I was given the privilege of doing that work, and <num value="9">nine</num> men and <num value="1">one</num> wagon were assigned me for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>I spent the larger part of my time, going and coming, in hunting on either the right or the left of the road, thereby obtaining all the deer and turkeys the command could consume, but paying very little attention to the road itself, in utter disregard of the usual military rule which requires that a sketch be made and an itinerary kept of all such marches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Hence I was a little puzzled when <persName n="Canby,Acting-Inspector General,,,," id="n0131.0002.00023.00063" reg="mostcommon:Canby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Acting-Inspector General">Acting-Inspector-General</roleName> <surname>Canby</surname></persName>, from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, wanted to go across from <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Indian River</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013974" n="1.000 23" reg="tampa, hillsborough, florida">Tampa</placeName>, and called on me for a copy of my map and itinerary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>But I had stood very high in drawing at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, and could not allow myself to be disturbed in any such way as that; so I unlocked what little recollection I had of the route and my general knowledge of the country, and prepared a very beautiful map and a quite elaborate itinerary, with which the inspector-general seemed greatly pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But I took great care, in addition, to send <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> a man with him who had been with me, and who was a good guide, so I felt quite safe respecting any possible imperfections that the <rs type="role" reg="Inspector General">inspector-general</rs> might find in my work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>I never heard anything more about that matter until <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0002.00024.00064" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and I met <persName n="Canby,General,,,," id="n0131.0002.00024.00065" reg="mostcommon:Canby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Canby</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Portland, Cumberland, Maine" key="tgn,7014272">Portland</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>At that time we had a little laugh at my expense respecting the beauty of that map of mine, and the accuracy with which I had delineated the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>His final attack was heavier than any of the preceding, but it was more firmly met by our troops and completely repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>There is probably no room for doubt that the enemy was beaten if we had but known it; but the battle-field was covered with timber and underbrush, so that nothing could be seen beyond a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>The error was a failure to estimate the effect that must have been produced upon the enemy as well as upon ourselves by so much hard fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>It was only necessary to hold our ground, trusting to the pluck and endurance of our men, and the victory would have been ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The general received me cordially, but, to my great surprise, no questions were asked, nor any mention made, of the bloody field from which I had just come, where <persName n="Lyon,,,,," id="n0131.0003.00049.00225" reg="nearbymention:Lyon,N.,,,"><surname>Lyon</surname></persName> had been killed, and his army, after a desperate battle, compelled to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>I was led at once to a large table on which maps were spread out, from which the general proceeded to explain at length the plans of the great campaign for which he was then preparing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>In general outline the plan proposed a march of the main <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">Army of the West</orgName> through <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">southwestern</rs> Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">northwestern</rs> Arkansas</placeName> to the valley of the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas River</placeName>, and thence down that river to the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, thus turning all the <rs>Confederate</rs> defenses of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName> down to and below <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>We walked down the street for some time in silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Then <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0131.0003.00049.00228" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,P.,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> turned to me and said: <q direct="unspecified">Well, what do you think of him?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>I replied, in words rather too strong to repeat in print, to the effect that my opinion as to his wisdom was the same as it always had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/></p> 
<p>It was a severe blow to the whole <rs>Blair</rs> family&mdash;the breaking, by the rude shock of war, of that idol they had so much helped to set up and make the commander of a great army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>From that day forward there was no concealment of the opposition of the <name>Blairs</name> to <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0131.0003.00049.00230" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,J.,C.,,"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/><pb id="p.50" n="50"/></p> 
<p>I had another occasion at that time to learn something important as to <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0131.0003.00050.00231" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,J.,C.,,"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>'s character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>He had ordered me to convert the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">1st Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="MOVolunteer">Missouri Volunteer Infantry</orgName> into an artillery regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>I had organized <num value="8">eight</num> batteries and used all the field-guns I could get.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>I applied to him personally for those guns, telling him I had a well-disciplined company of officers and men ready to man them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>He gave me the order without hesitation, but when I went to the arsenal I found an order there countermanding the order he had given me. I returned to headquarters, and easily obtained a renewal of the order to issue the guns to me. Determining to get ahead this time, I took the quickest conveyance to the arsenal, but only to find that the telegraph had got ahead of me &mdash;the order was again countermanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>The next day I quietly inquired at headquarters about the secret of my repeated disappointment, and learned that some foreign adventurer had obtained permission to raise a company of artillery troops and wanted those new rifled guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>It was true the company had not been raised, but I thought that would probably make no difference, so I never mentioned the matter to the general again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Instead I planned a flank movement which proved far more successful than the direct attack could possibly have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>I explained to <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n0131.0003.00050.00233" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName> the great need of field-guns and equipment for his army, and suggested that if ordered <address><street n="East point">East</street></address> I might by personal efforts obtain all he needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>He at once adopted my suggestion, bade me sit down at a desk in his room and write the necessary order, and he signed it without reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>I readily obtained <num value="24">twenty-four</num> new rifled <name type="weapon">Parrott guns</name>, and soon had them in service in the <orgName n="Department of the West" type="department">Western Department</orgName>, in lieu of the <num value="6">six</num> guns I had failed to get from the <orgName n="St. Louis Arsenal" type="arsenal">St. Louis Arsenal</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>When I had accomplished this duty and returned to <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, where I arrived in the early part of <dateStruct value="1861-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n0131.0003.00051.00234" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName> had taken the field in the central part of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, with the main body of his army, in which were <num value="8">eight</num> batteries of my regiment.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>There was no organized battery in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, but there were officers and men enough belonging to the different batteries of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MO1">1st Missouri</orgName>, and recruits, to make a medium-sized company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>They had been instructed in the school of the piece, but no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>I hastily put them upon the cars, with <num value="4">four</num> old smooth-bore bronze guns, horses that had never been hitched to a piece, and harness that had not been fitted to the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Early next morning we arrived at <placeName reg="Big River, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2170354">Big River</placeName> where the bridge had been burned, unloaded the battery and horses by the use of platforms extemporized from railroad ties, hitched up, and forded the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>It appeared that <persName n="Carlin,Colonel,,,," id="n0131.0003.00052.00243" reg="nearbymention:Carlin,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Carlin</surname></persName> had the older date as colonel of volunteers, while <persName n="Plummer,Colonel,,,," id="n0131.0003.00052.00244" reg="nearbymention:Plummer,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Plummer</surname></persName> was commanding, by special assignment of <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n0131.0003.00052.00245" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName>, a brigade in which at least <num value="1">one</num> of the colonels was senior, not only to him, but also to <persName n="Carlin,Colonel,,,," id="n0131.0003.00052.00246" reg="nearbymention:Carlin,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Carlin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>It was clear enough that according to the <rs>Articles</rs> of War this senior colonel of the <rs type="place">Cape Girardeau</rs> brigade should command the combined forces; but that would be in plain disregard of <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n0131.0003.00052.00247" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName>'s order, the authority for which nobody knew, but in comparison with which the <rs>Articles</rs> of War or the <rs>Army Regulations</rs> were at that time regarded as practically of trifling consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>How long the enemy had been in that position I have never learned; but it is certain that his presence there was not even suspected by our commander, who supposed him to be in full retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>At once, therefore, I set to work to organize a suitable force, including the <rs>Indian</rs> regiments, to hold the country we had gained, and <num value="3">three</num> good divisions to prosecute such operations as might be determined on, and at once commenced the march <name>north</name> and <name>east</name> toward the theater of future active operations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>The result of this, and of radical influence in general, was that my nomination as major-general of volunteers, then pending in the <name>Senate</name>, was not confirmed, while both <persName n="Blunt,,,,," id="n0131.0004.00064.00332" reg="mostcommon:Blunt,nomatch:0"><surname>Blunt</surname></persName> and <persName n="Herron,,,,," id="n0131.0004.00064.00333" reg="mostcommon:Herron,nomatch:0"><surname>Herron</surname></persName> were nominated and confirmed as major-generals!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Upon learning this, after I assumed command of the department I ordered <persName n="Herron,,,,," id="n0131.0004.00064.00340" reg="mostcommon:Herron,nomatch:0"><surname>Herron</surname></persName> to report for duty to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0004.00064.00341" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> before <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>This brief explanation is all that seems necessary to show the connection between the several events as they appear in the official records.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>But <persName n="Curtis,,,,," id="n0131.0004.00065.00345" reg="nearbymention:Curtis,Samuel,R.,,"><surname>Curtis</surname></persName> would not consent to this; he said he wanted me to command the <orgName n="Army of the Frontier" type="army">Army of the Frontier</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>He thus invited the confidence which he afterward betrayed, and for which he rebuked me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>This feeling was intensified by his conduct in the <name>Herron</name> affair, and by the determination gradually manifested not to permit me or my command to do anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>He for a long time kept up a pretense of wanting me to move <name>east</name> or <name>west</name>, or south, or somewhere, but negatived all my efforts actually to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The situation seemed to me really unendurable: I was compelled to lie at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName> all the latter part of winter, with a well-appointed <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> eager for active service, hundreds of miles from any hostile force, and where we were compelled to haul our own supplies, in wagons, over the worst of roads, <measure n="120miles" type="distance">120 miles</measure> from the railroad terminus at <placeName key="tgn,2060292" n="1.000 108" reg="rolla, phelps, missouri">Rolla</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>In acknowledging the <rs>President</rs>'s letter on <dateStruct value="-06-1"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="1">1</day></dateStruct>, I concluded by saying: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>If this hope be realized, <num value="1">one</num> of my most embarrassing difficulties will be removed, or at least greatly diminished.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>The military problem in that department, as understood by me and by my superiors in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, was at that time a comparatively simple <num value="1">one</num>, though my predecessor in command of the department entertained different views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>With my views of the military situation, whether confined to my own department or extended to embrace the entire country, there was but <num value="1">one</num> course to <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> pursue, namely, to send all available force to assist in the capture of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and the opening of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to the gulf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>After that I could easily operate from points on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> as a base, capture <placeName reg="Little Rock, Pulaski, Arkansas" key="tgn,7013897">Little Rock</placeName> and the line of the <rs>Arkansas</rs>, and then make that river the base of future operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Hence, in response to a request from <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00070.00372" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName>, I at once sent to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00070.00373" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and other commanders at the front all the troops I could possibly spare, saying at the same time that this would leave me very weak, but that I was <q direct="unspecified">willing to risk it in view of the vast importance of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0005.00070.00374" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s success.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/></p> 
<p>Thus I began my military operations by stripping the department of troops to the lowest possible defensive limit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>But this was what I had so earnestly urged before, when in a subordinate position; and I was glad to do it when the responsibility rested upon me. My loan of troops to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0005.00070.00375" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was returned with interest as soon as practicable after <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> had fallen, and I was then able to advance a large force, under <persName n="Steele,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00070.00376" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Steele</surname></persName>, for the capture of <placeName reg="Little Rock, Pulaski, Arkansas" key="tgn,7013897">Little Rock</placeName>, resulting in holding the entire line of the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas River</placeName> from that time forward.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible for me to send away more than a small part of those troops if I had not been able to replace them by <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>For my part, I could see neither necessity nor excuse for quarreling with the governor of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and thus depriving myself and the nation of his legitimate aid. <persName n="Gamble,Governor,,,," id="n0131.0005.00071.00386" reg="nearbymention:Gamble,Hamilton,R.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Gamble</surname></persName> was perhaps <q direct="unspecified">behind the times</q> in his views on the slavery question, although decidedly in favor of gradual emancipation; and he was utterly intolerant of those radical schemes for accomplishing ends by lawless means, then so loudly advocated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>I thought at the time a more radical policy might possibly tend to harmonize the <rs>Union</rs> factions and allay the excitement, and frequently told <persName n="Gamble,Governor,,,," id="n0131.0005.00071.00387" reg="nearbymention:Gamble,Hamilton,R.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Gamble</surname></persName> that it would be necessary to adopt a policy on the negro question more in harmony with the views of the administration and of the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>To this the governor assented, and seemed desirous of going as far in that direction as he could carry the <rs>Union</rs> people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> with him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>But it soon became evident that nothing would satisfy <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> the radical leaders short of the overthrow of the existing State government; that a reconciliation of the quarrel between the <q direct="unspecified">pestilent factions</q><note anchored="yes">

<p>General: For the purpose of restoring order and law and maintaining the authority of the <rs>Federal</rs> and State governments in the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">State of Missouri</placeName>, it is necessary that we have an understanding as to the most important measures to be adopted.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>I have tendered my resignation as governor, and have been requested to withdraw it on the ground that it is necessary to the peace and quiet of the <rs>State</rs> that I remain in office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>In this request you have united with a majority of the convention and multitudes of private citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>I am willing to accede to the request, and, if an ordinance of emancipation is passed, to remain in office, if on the part of the government I can be sure of its cooperation in my efforts to preserve the peace and remove all causes of dissension and dissatisfaction from among the people.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>You are right in saying that I was an anti-slavery man, though not an abolitionist, before the war. These terms have greatly changed their relative meaning since the rebellion broke out. I regard universal emancipation as <num value="1">one</num> of the necessary consequences of the rebellion, or rather as <num value="1">one</num> of the means absolutely necessary to a complete restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;and this because slavery was the great cause of the rebellion, and the only obstacle in the way of a perfect union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The perception of these important truths is spreading with almost astounding <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> rapidity in this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>If so, our difficulties will be substantially at an end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>When the popular mind seizes a great principle and resolves to carry it into execution, it becomes impatient of the restraints imposed by existing laws, and in its haste to break down the barriers which stand in the way of its darling object, becomes regardless of all law, and anarchy is the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>This is our difficulty here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>The people will have freedom for the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>No law of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> nor of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, nor yet any order of the <rs>President</rs>, meets the case.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>my dear Sir: Your despatch, asking in substance whether, in case <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> shall adopt gradual emancipation, the <rs>General Government</rs> will protect slave-owners in that species of property during the short time it shall be permitted by the <rs>State</rs> to exist within it, has been received.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Desirous as I am that emancipation shall be adopted by <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and believing as I do that <hi rend="italics">gradual</hi> can be made better than <hi rend="italics">immediate</hi>, for both <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>, except when military necessity changes the case, my impulse is to say that such protection would be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>I cannot know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>If the period from the initiation to the final end should be comparatively short, and the act should prevent persons being sold during that period into more lasting slavery, the whole would be easier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>I do not wish to pledge the <rs>General Government</rs> to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery, beyond what can be fairly claimed under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>I suppose, however, this is not desired; but that it is desired for the military force of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, while in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, to not be used in subverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the progress of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>This I would desire also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>I have very earnestly urged the slave States to adopt emancipation; and it ought to be, and is, an object with me not to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good faith do to that end. You are therefore authorized to act in the spirit of this letter, in conjunction with what may appear to be the military necessities of your department.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>Although this letter will become public at some time, it is not intended to be made so now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Yours truly, </p><closer> <signed><persName n="Lincoln,,A.,,," id="n0131.0005.00076.00398" reg="expanded:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>A.</foreName>  <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer></body> </text></p></quote> <pb id="p.77" n="77"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>My impression is that the nature of this quarrel in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> was not fully understood at the time in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, as <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00077.00399" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> wrote me that neither of the factions was regarded as really friendly to the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>But my belief is that they were then, as they subsequently proved to be, divided on the <name>Presidential</name> question as well as in State politics; that the conservatives were sincere in their friendship and support of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0131.0005.00077.00400" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and desired his renomination, while the radicals were intriguing for <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0131.0005.00077.00401" reg="mostcommon:Chase,Salmon,P.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> or some other more radical man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>This struggle between extreme radicalism and conservatism among the <rs>Union</rs> people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> was long and bitter, but I have nothing to do with its history beyond the period of my command in that department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>It resulted, as is now well known, in the triumph of radicalism in the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, and the consequent final loss of power by that party in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Such extremes could not fail to produce a popular revulsion, and it required no great foresight to predict the final result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>The factions in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> gave the military commander trouble enough in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>; but to that was added the similar and hardly less troublesome party quarrel in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>I cannot give a more accurate account of the complicated situation there than by quoting from my correspondence and journal of that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>On <dateStruct value="-08-28"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="28">28</day></dateStruct> I wrote to <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0131.0005.00077.00402" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as follows: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>In reply to your telegram of the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num>, transmitting copy of <num value="1">one</num> received from <num value="2">two</num> influential citizens of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, I beg leave to state some of the facts connected with the horrible massacre at <placeName reg="Lawrence, Douglas, Kansas" key="tgn,7013875">Lawrence</placeName>, and also relative to the assaults made upon me by a certain class of influential politicians.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Since the capture of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, a considerable portion of the rebel army in the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs> has disbanded, and large numbers of men have come back to <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, many of them doubtless in the hope of being permitted to remain at their <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> former homes in peace, while some have come under instructions to carry on a guerrilla warfare, and others, men of the worst character, become marauders on their own account, caring nothing for the <rs>Union</rs>, nor for the rebellion, except as the latter affords them a cloak for their brigandage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>Under instructions from the rebel authorities, as I am informed and believe, considerable bands, called <q direct="unspecified">Border Guards,</q> were organized in the counties of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> bordering on <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, for the ostensible purpose of protecting those counties from inroads from <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and preventing the slaves of rebels from escaping from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> into <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>These bands were unquestionably encouraged, fed, and harbored by a very considerable portion of the people of those border counties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Many of those people were in fact the families of these <q direct="unspecified">bushwhackers,</q> who are brigands of the worst type.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Upon the representation of <persName n="Ewing,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00078.00403" reg="mostcommon:Ewing,Hugh,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewing</surname></persName> and others familiar with the facts, I became satisfied there could be no cure for this evil short of the removal from those counties of all slaves entitled to their freedom, and of the families of all men known to belong to these bands, and others who were known to sympathize with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>Accordingly I directed <persName n="Ewing,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00078.00404" reg="mostcommon:Ewing,Hugh,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewing</surname></persName> to adopt and carry out the policy he had indicated, warning him, however, of the retaliation which might be attempted, and that he must be fully prepared to prevent it before commencing such severe measures.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Almost immediately after it became known that such policy had been adopted, <persName n="Quantrill,,,,," id="n0131.0005.00078.00405" reg="mostcommon:Quantrill,W.,C.,,:1"><surname>Quantrill</surname></persName> secretly assembled from several of the border counties of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> about <num value="300">300</num> of his men. They met at a preconcerted place of rendezvous near the <placeName reg="Kansas, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> line, at about sunset, and immediately marched for <placeName reg="Lawrence, Douglas, Kansas" key="tgn,7013875">Lawrence</placeName>, which place they reached at daylight the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>They sacked and burned the town and murdered the citizens in the most barbarous manner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>It is easy to see that any unguarded town in a country where such a number of outlaws can be assembled is liable to a similar fate, if the villains are willing to risk the retribution which must follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>In this case <num value="100">100</num> of them have already been slain, and the remainder are hotly pursued in all directions.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>I am officially informed that a large meeting has been held at <placeName reg="Leavenworth, Leavenworth, Kansas" key="tgn,2036674">Leavenworth</placeName>, in which a resolution was adopted to the effect that the people would assemble at a certain place on the border, on <dateStruct value="-09-8"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="8">8</day></dateStruct>, for the purpose of entering <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> to search for their stolen property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>This statement, following an interview on that subject, was calculated to mislead a large number of welldis-posed people who would not for a moment think of acting in opposition to military rules, and to greatly increase the number <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> of people who would assemble at <placeName key="tgn,2036935" n="1.000 10" reg="paola, miami, kansas">Paola</placeName>, and seriously complicate the difficulty.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>My main object was to secure the full cooperation of the <rs>State</rs> government in preventing the invasion of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>For this purpose I had to consult to a considerable degree the political views and aims of the governor and his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>Their object was, of course, to make out of <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0131.0005.00082.00466" reg="nearbymention:Lane,James,H.,,"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s project as much capital as possible against him.

Viewing matters in this light, the governor and his advisers were strongly inclined to the opinion that the surest way of making capital for themselves out of <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0131.0005.00082.00468" reg="nearbymention:Lane,James,H.,,"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s move was to let him go on with it, without any interference on their part, confident that it would turn out a grand humbug. . . . After reaching <placeName reg="Kansas City, Jackson, Missouri" key="tgn,7013820">Kansas City</placeName> and talking with <persName n="Ewing,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00082.00469" reg="mostcommon:Ewing,Hugh,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Genl.</roleName> <surname>Ewing</surname></persName>, I replied to the governor, accepting the services of as many of his troops as he and <persName n="Ewing,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00082.00470" reg="mostcommon:Ewing,Hugh,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Genl.</roleName> <surname>Ewing</surname></persName> should deem necessary for the protection of all the towns in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> near the border, stating that with <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> so protected, <persName n="Ewing,General,,,," id="n0131.0005.00082.00471" reg="mostcommon:Ewing,Hugh,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Genl.</roleName> <surname>Ewing</surname></persName> would not only carry out his order for the expulsion of disloyal persons, but also in a short time drive out the guerrillas from his district and restore peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>In addition to this, I wrote the governor a private letter urging him to issue his proclamation discouraging the <name>Paola</name> meeting and warning his people against any attempt to go into <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and informing him I would issue an order forbidding armed men not in the regular military service from crossing the line.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>Out of consideration for popular opinion and the well-known wishes of the <rs>President</rs> relative to freedom of speech and of the press, I have forborne until, in my belief, further forbearance would lead to disastrous results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>It is barely possible that I may not have to enforce the order against the public press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>They may yield without the application of force; but I do not expect it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>A distinct approval by the <rs>President</rs> of my proposed action, and a knowledge of the fact here, would end the whole matter at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>I made no remarks relative to the radical party, nor to radicals as a party or class of citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>I spoke of those men and papers who by tolerating and encouraging lawlessness in the name of radicalism had done so much towards producing trouble in the <rs>State</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>It is perhaps natural that any honest man should feel, as you propose, to disown a party in which such abuses are tolerated, but I cannot see the propriety of so doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>Our conversation on the <num value="29" type="ordinal">29th</num> was regarded by me as confidential, and I still desire it to be so regarded by you, and also this letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>The former sufferings of these men from the lawlessness which has so long existed on the border made them willing to do military duty to save from destruction or loss what property they had left.

<p><persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00119.00707" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, on a visit to <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> about the end of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, a few days before the date of the foregoing letter, disclosed to me his general plans for the coming campaign, and the part I was expected to take in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>It would be difficult to give an adequate conception of the feeling of eager expectation and enthusiasm with which, having given my final salutation to my <q direct="unspecified">friends</q> in the <name>Senate</name>, I entered upon the preparations for this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>Of its possible results to the country there was room in my mind only for confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>But for myself, <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> it was to decide my fate, and that speedily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>My reputation and rank as a soldier, so long held in the political balance, were at length to be settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>The longhoped-for opportunity had come, and that under a general whose character and ability were already established, and of the justice of whose judgment and action regarding his subordinates there could be no reason for doubt in my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>My command was to be mostly of veteran troops, and not too large for my experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>Its comparative smallness was a source of satisfaction to me at that time, rather than anything like jealousy of my senior brother commanders of the <rs>Cumberland</rs> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> care was to provide my men with all necessary equipment for the campaign, and to fill up the ranks by calling in all absentees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>It was a refreshing sight to see the changed aspect and feeling of the gallant little army as it marched with full ranks and complete equipment, newly clad, from <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> toward <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>My next thought was to win the respect and confidence of my men. An opportunity to do this was speedily afforded in the delicate operations in front of <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>The result may perhaps be fairly expressed in the words of an old soldier who was overheard to say as I passed his regiment that day under fire: <q direct="unspecified">It is all right, boys; I like the way the old man chaws his tobacco.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>From that day forward I felt that the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 23">Twenty-third Corps</orgName> confided in me as I did in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>I never had any doubt they would do just what I expected them to do, and would take it for granted that it was <q direct="unspecified">all right.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/></p> 
<p>It is with the greatest pleasure that I record here the just tribute paid to that splendid body of men by <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00120.00708" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> about the close of the <rs n="Atlanta Campaign" type="campaign">Atlanta campaign</rs>: <q direct="unspecified">The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 23">Twenty-third Corps</orgName> never failed to do all that was expected of it.</q>

<p>And it is with equal pleasure that I record the just <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> and generous treatment shown by <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00121.00709" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> toward me from the beginning of that campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Although much my senior in years, experience, and reputation, he never showed that he was aware of it, but always treated me as his peer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>In his official reports and his memoirs he has never been unkind or unjust, though it has never been his habit to bestow much praise on individuals, or to think much of the rewards due his subordinates, generally giving credit as justly due to troops rather than to commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>It would be impossible for me not to cherish feelings of strong affection for my old commander, as well as the profound respect due his character as a man and soldier, and his brilliant genius.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>If anything I may say in criticism of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00121.00710" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s acts or words shall seem unkind or be considered unjust, I can only disclaim any such feeling, and freely admit that it would be wholly unworthy of the relations that always existed between us. I write not for the present, but for the future, and my only wish is to represent the truth as it appears to me. If I fail to see it clearly, I do but condemn myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>History will do impartial justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>Having been in a subordinate position in the campaigns of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, I shall not attempt to write a full account of those campaigns, but shall limit myself to such comments as seem to me to be called for upon the already published histories of those campaigns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>In estimating the merits of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0007.00121.00711" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Memoirs,</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/> 
<p>The following was written in <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>, soon after the appearance of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> edition.</p></note> it should be remembered that he does not, and does not claim to, occupy the position of a disinterested, impartial historian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>He writes, not for the purpose of doing equal and exact justice to all actors in a great historical drama, but for the purpose of elucidating his own acts and motives, and vindicating himself against the harsh criticism <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> and censure which have followed some of his most important transactions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>However unconscious <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00122.00712" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> himself may have been of the influence of such motives, their existence was natural, even inevitable, and they have manifestly given their coloring to all of the memoirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>This should not occasion surprise, nor even regret, much less be held to justify unkind criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>It is desirable for the future historian to have the view of the chief actor in any portion of history taken from his own standpoint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>It is only by a critical, laborious and honest comparison of this view with those of other actors and eye-witnesses that impartial history may ultimately be written.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>My present purpose is simply to direct attention to some points in the history of those campaigns of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00122.00713" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in which I was <num value="1">one</num> of his principal subordinates, upon which the views of others were at the time, or have since been, different from his own. In what I have to say the motive of self-vindication can have little or no influence; for, with some unimportant exceptions, <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00122.00714" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> does relatively full justice to me and to the little army which I had the honor to command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>I shall speak mainly of the acts of others, especially the noble dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>I must preface my remarks by observing that the organization of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0007.00122.00715" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> during the <rs n="Atlanta Campaign" type="campaign">Atlanta campaign</rs> was extremely faulty, in that the <num value="3">three</num> grand divisions were very unequal in strength, the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName> having nearly <hi rend="italics"><num value="5">five</num> times</hi> the infantry strength of the <orgName n="Army of the Ohio" type="army">Army of the Ohio</orgName>, and more than twice that of the <orgName n="Army of the Tennessee" type="army">Army of the Tennessee</orgName>, even after the junction of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0131.0007.00122.00716" reg="nearbymention:Blair,P.,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>The cavalry, of which <num value="2">two</num> divisions belonged to the <orgName n="Army of the Ohio" type="army">Army of the Ohio</orgName>, always acted either under the direct orders of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00122.00717" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> or of the nearest army commander, according to the flank on which it was operating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>This inequality resulted from the fact that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0007.00122.00718" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> army was composed of <num value="3">three</num> separate armies, or such portions of them as could be spared from their several departments, united for that campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/><persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00123.00719" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,George,H.,,:16"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was, naturally enough, disinclined to part with any of his troops, and the troops did not wish to be separated from the old army in which they had won so much honor, nor from the commander whom they revered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>Besides, <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00123.00720" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,George,H.,,:16"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> had had much greater experience in the command of troops in the field than I, and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00123.00721" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, if he thought of it at all, may well have doubted the wisdom of diminishing the command of the <num value="1">one</num> to increase that of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>I do not know whether this matter was discussed at all before the opening of the campaign, certainly not by me, who would have been restrained by motives of delicacy, if by no other, from mentioning it. But in fact my ambition was then limited to fighting well and successfully with the single corps under my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>It was only after experience had drawn attention more pointedly to the evils resulting from faulty organization, and success had inspired legitimate confidence, that this subject became matter of much thought and some discussion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>But this faulty organization continued to the end of the <rs n="Atlanta Campaign" type="campaign">Atlanta campaign</rs>, and was, as I think will clearly appear, <num value="1">one</num> of the causes of many of the partial failures or imperfect successes that characterized our operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>It was often attempted to remedy this defect by ordering a division or corps of the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName> to <q direct="unspecified">cooperate with</q> or <q direct="unspecified">support</q> <num value="1">one</num> of the others in making an attack; but military experience has shown that <q direct="unspecified">cooperate</q> and <q direct="unspecified">support</q> mean, in general, to do nothing effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>The corps commanders, <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> generally, not being in the habit of acting independently, and not being in direct communication with the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, and hence not familiar with his plans and views, would not act with the necessary promptness or vigor; and not regarding themselves as absolutely under the orders of the general they were directed to support, they would not obey his orders or requests unless they were in accord with their own views; while <num value="1">one</num> of these corps commanders, <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00124.00723" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> says, manifested an ambition to get <num value="1">one</num> of the separate armies under his command and win a victory on his <q direct="unspecified">own hook.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>But <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0007.00124.00724" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> fails to state that he encouraged all this by his own now well-known erroneous opinion upon the question of the relative rank of army and corps commanders; that this vital question was evaded until its decision in a special case&mdash;that of <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0131.0007.00124.00725" reg="mostcommon:Stanley,Pulaski,,,:1"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> and <persName n="Schofield,,,,," id="n0131.0007.00124.00726" reg="nearbymention:Schofield,J.,M.,,"><surname>Schofield</surname></persName>&mdash;became absolutely necessary, and was then decided erroneously, the error resulting in failure and great disappointment to <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0007.00124.00727" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>Had this question been decided at an early day according to the plain import of the law, as was afterward done by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and orders given to corps commanders to obey instead of <q direct="unspecified">cooperate</q> or <q direct="unspecified">support,</q> much trouble would have been avoided.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>Clearly, such an assault should not be attempted except as the only chance of victory; and then the subordinate officers and men should be clearly informed precisely what they are expected to do, and made to understand the necessity for so great and unusual a sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>This successful movement was essentially the same as that which had been previously made to dislodge the enemy from <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, and that by which <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0008.00143.00922" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had been transferred from <orgName n="New Hope Church" type="church">New Hope Church</orgName> to the railroad in front of <placeName key="tgn,2129741" n="1.000 35" reg="allatoona, bartow, georgia">Allatoona</placeName>, as well as that by which <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> was afterward captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>Hence the existence of this <q direct="unspecified">alternative</q> could not have been unthought of by any of us at the time of the assault on <placeName key="tgn,2062292" n="1.000 10" reg="Kenesaw, Adams, Nebraska">Kenesaw</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>But there was another alternative in this and similar cases, which was much discussed at various times during the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>Its practicability can be judged of only upon general principles, for it was never tried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>It was to detach <num value="2">two</num> or <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">three corps</orgName>, nearly half our army (which was about double the strength of the enemy), make a detour wide enough to avoid his fortifications, and strike directly at his flank and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>Such a movement, it was urged, at <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2062292" n="1.000 10" reg="Kenesaw, Adams, Nebraska">Kenesaw</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> would have compelled <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0131.0008.00143.00923" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> to fight a battle on equal terms with <num value="0.5">one half</num> of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0008.00143.00924" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, while he had to hold his parapets against the other half.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>Whatever else may be said of this proposed movement, it would undoubtedly have been more hazardous and much more decisive, <num value="1">one</num> way or the other, than any of the plans actually adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>It certainly promised success proportionate to the cost, instead <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> of a costly failure, which the assault of fortified lines had almost invariably proved to be.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>There were doubtless many occasions in the <rs n="Atlanta Campaign" type="campaign">Atlanta campaign</rs> when the enemy's intrenchments could have been assaulted with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>These were when the position had been but recently occupied and the fortifications were very slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>After several days' occupation, as at the points attacked by <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0008.00144.00933" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,George,H.,,:16"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> and <persName n="McPherson,,,,," id="n0131.0008.00144.00934" reg="nearbymention:McPherson,James,B.,,"><surname>McPherson</surname></persName>, the lines became impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>Frequent efforts were made, and by none more earnestly than by <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0008.00144.00935" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, to press the troops to a vigorous assault of the enemy's position <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> under the favorable circumstances above referred to. But the general feeling of the army, including not only privates, but officers of nearly all grades, was undoubtedly opposed to such attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>The notion was very prevalent that there was no necessity of fighting the enemy on unequal terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>When attacked, either with or without cover, the troops would fight with the most determined valor, and almost invariably with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>So when attacking the enemy in open ground there was no lack of energy or pluck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>But we lose <num value="1">one</num> of the most important lessons of the war if we fail to remember and appreciate the fact that our veteran troops are very loath to make an attack where they believe they have not a fair chance of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>This feeling must be attributed, not to a lack of high soldierly qualities, but to intelligence and good sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>The veteran American soldier fights very much as he has been accustomed to work his farm or run his sawmill: he wants to see a fair prospect that it is <q direct="unspecified">going to pay.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>His loyalty, discipline, and pluck will not allow him under any circumstances to retreat without orders, much less to run away; but if he encounters a resistance which he thinks he cannot overcome, or which he thinks it would <q direct="unspecified">cost too much</q> to overcome, he will lie down, cover himself with a little parapet, and hold his ground against any force that may attempt to drive him back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>This feeling of the soldier is an element in the problem of war which cannot be ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>The general who, with such an army, would win the full measure of success due to greatly superior numbers, must maneuver so as to compel the enemy to fight him on approximately equal terms, instead of assaulting fortifications where, against modern weapons, numbers are of little or no avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>In the days of the bayonet successful tactics consisted in massing a superior force upon some vital point, and breaking the enemy's line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>Now it is the fire of the musket, not the bayonet, that decides <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>To mass troops against the fire of a covered line is simply to devote them to destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>The greater the mass, the greater the loss&mdash;that is all. A large mass has no more chance of success than a small <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>That this is absolutely true since the introduction of breechloaders is probably not doubted by any <num value="1">one</num>; and it was very nearly true with the muzzle-loading rifles used during our late war, as was abundantly demonstrated on many occasions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>I have always believed that the true tactics of our late war, whenever our force was double that of the enemy (as it sometimes was and always should have been at all points where decisive movements were to be made), were to throw <num value="0.5">one half</num> the force upon the enemy's rear, so as to compel him to attack that force or else retreat by side roads with loss of trains and artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>This would doubtless have been a bold departure from the ancient tactics, which had not yet been proved obsolete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>Yet I always thought it strange that our leading generals were unwilling to attempt it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>Sherman at once sent to me for <hi rend="italics">all my artillery</hi>, which responded to his call at a full gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>He led the batteries in person to some high, open ground <hi rend="italics">in front of our line</hi> near the <rs type="place">Howard House</rs>, placed them in position, and directed their fire, which from that advanced position enfiladed the parapets from which our troops had been driven, and which the enemy then occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>With the aid of that terrible raking fire, the division of Union troops very quickly regained the intrenchments they had lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>I was occupied in forming my <orgName n="Infantry Reserve" type="military">infantry reserve</orgName> to meet the enemy if <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n0131.0008.00147.00944" reg="mostcommon:Logan,John,A.,,:3"><surname>Logan</surname></persName>'s troops did not drive them back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>The primary and principal cause of this and all similar difficulties during the <rs n="Atlanta Campaign" type="campaign">Atlanta campaign</rs> was the grave error of opinion which disregarded the special rank of army and department commanders given them by the <rs>President</rs>'s assignment under the law, and the still graver error of judgment in leaving such an important question open until the eve of battle, in the <q direct="unspecified">hope that there would be no necessity for making this decision.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>This error seems incomprehensible when it is considered that it in effect nullified the <rs>President</rs>'s selection of army and department commanders at the most important of all moments, the crisis of battle, by making these commanders subject to the orders of any general of older commission whose troops happened to be adjacent to theirs.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>If the plan then decided on and ordered had been carried out, <num value="3">three</num> divisions of infantry and nearly all the artillery of the army would have been in position at <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName> and well intrenched long before the head of <orgName n="column"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00215.01621" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s column</orgName>, without any artillery, came in sight of that place late in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>That position would have been secured beyond doubt until the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>The army would have marched to <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName> early in the night of the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="29">29th</day></dateStruct>, instead of after <time value="12am">midnight</time> as it actually did. That would have given the enemy the afternoon and night in which to lay his pontoons and cross his artillery and trains at <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>But that would not have been a serious matter, in view of the situation as it was understood by me up to about <time value="8am">8 A.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>But in view of the information received by me after <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> that morning, and the altered plan decided on soon after <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, the situation became very materially different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>Under this plan the army must be ready to encounter a formidable enemy either in the position then occupied on <placeName reg="Duck River, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098878">Duck River</placeName>, or at some point on the road between that place and <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>Hence I determined to keep the main body of the troops together, and trust to <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00215.01626" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,D.,S.,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s <num value="1">one</num> division to hold <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName> until the army should reach that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>That is to <pb id="p.216" n="216"/> say, I decided to take the chances of a pitched battle at any point the enemy might select between <placeName reg="Duck River, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098878">Duck River</placeName> and <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName>, as well as that of holding the latter place with <num value="1">one</num> division against any hostile force which might reach it before dark.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2336"/>There was no anxiety in my mind about what might happen at <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName> after dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>The danger which actually developed there between dark and midnight &mdash;of which I knew nothing until several days afterward&mdash;resulted entirely from faulty execution of my orders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>I arrived at <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName> at dusk with the head of the main column, having ordered all the troops to follow in close order, and (except <persName n="Ruger,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01627" reg="mostcommon:Ruger,Thomas,H.,,:2"><surname>Ruger</surname></persName>'s troops, which I took to <persName n="Thompson,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01628" reg="mostcommon:Thompson,Jeff,,,:2"><surname>Thompson</surname></persName>'s) to form line on the right of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01629" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,D.,S.,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> at <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName>, covering the pike back toward <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>In that contemplated position, if <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01631" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> had attacked at any time in the night we would have had decidedly the advantage of him. I had no anxiety on that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>When informed, about midnight, that <persName n="Cox,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01632" reg="mostcommon:Cox,Jacob,D.,,:2"><surname>Cox</surname></persName> had arrived, I understood that my orders had been exactly executed, and then ordered <persName n="Cox,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01633" reg="mostcommon:Cox,Jacob,D.,,:2"><surname>Cox</surname></persName> to take the lead and the other divisions to follow, from the right by the rear, in the march to <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>But it happened that only <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Whitaker,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01634" reg="mostcommon:Whitaker,nomatch:0"><surname>Whitaker</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Kimball,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01635" reg="mostcommon:Kimball,Nathan,,,:1"><surname>Kimball</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, to which I gave the orders in person, followed <persName n="Ruger,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01636" reg="mostcommon:Ruger,Thomas,H.,,:2"><surname>Ruger</surname></persName>'s. Hence that <num value="1">one</num> brigade was the only force we had in line between <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00216.01637" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s bivouac and the turnpike that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>If that fact had been known to the enemy, the result would have been embarrassing, but not very serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>If the enemy had got possession of a point on the pike, the column from <placeName reg="Duck River, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098878">Duck River</placeName> would have taken the country road a short distance to the west of <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName> and <placeName reg="Thompson's Station, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101805">Thompson's Station</placeName>, and marched on to <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>The situation at <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName> in the night was <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> not by any means a desperate <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>Veteran troops are not so easily cut off in an open country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>The annotation upon the copy filed in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> of the order actually given to the troops on <dateStruct value="-11-29"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="29">29</day></dateStruct> explains how that mistake occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>In brief, the draft of an order prepared in writing for another purpose, but not issued, was by some unexplained blunder substituted for the oral orders actually dictated to a staff officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>It was an example of how the improvised staff of a volunteer army, like the <q direct="unspecified">non-military agencies of government,</q> may interfere with military operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>The serious danger at <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName> ended at dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>The gallant action of <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00217.01638" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,D.,S.,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> and his <num value="1">one</num> division at that place in the afternoon of <dateStruct value="-11-29"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="29">29</day></dateStruct> cannot be overestimated or too highly praised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>If the enemy had gained a position there in the afternoon which we could not have passed round in the night, the situation would then have become very serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>But, as I had calculated, the enemy did not have time to do that before dark, against <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0131.0011.00217.01639" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,D.,S.,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s stubborn resistance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>I content myself with the simple remark that, in my opinion, if my own orders had been carried out as I gave them, and my reasonable suggestion to my superior in the rear to bridge the <rs>Harpeth</rs> at <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName> had been promptly acted on, there would have been far less risk of failure than must frequently be incurred in war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>I then role forward and reported to <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0012.00226.01722" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, whom I found waiting for me at the place he had selected for the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 23">Twenty-third Corps</orgName> in the defensive line about <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>I have often thought that I may not have shown due appreciation of his kindness at that moment, for I did not then feel very grateful to him; but he gave no indication that he thought me unappreciative of his approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>When I awoke after that thoroughly refreshing sleep the annoyance I had felt on account of the embarrassments experienced during the retreat was replaced by reflections of a much more satisfactory character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>Hence it was not possible for me to give any full account of the distinguished services of those <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>The cavalry were never seen by me. They were far in front or on the flank, doing all the <q direct="unspecified">seeing</q> for me, giving me information of vital importance in respect to the enemy's movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>In fact, the redoubtable <rs>Forrest</rs> had become famous, and his troopers were esteemed a very large factor in the problem then undergoing solution&mdash;greater in some respects, as I have pointed out, than the events justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>In my report of the <rs n="Battle of Franklin" type="battle">battle of Franklin</rs> I gave all the information in my possession of the gallant action of our cavalry in driving that of the enemy back across the <rs>Harpeth</rs> at the very time when his infantry assault was decisively repulsed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>I have always regarded it as a very remarkable, and to me a very fortunate, circumstance that the movements of my infantry columns were at no time seriously interfered with by the enemy's more numerous cavalry&mdash;not even at <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName>, where <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0131.0012.00228.01729" reg="mostcommon:Stanley,Pulaski,,,:1"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> was attacked by cavalry as well as infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>Hence I have had no inclination to make any investigation respecting the details of the action of troops, only temporarily under my command, whose gallant conduct and untiring vigilance contributed all that was needed to the complete success of the military operations intrusted to my immediate direction by our common superior, the department commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>I have now, as always heretofore, only words of highest praise for the services of the <orgName n="Cavalry Corps" type="corps">cavalry corps</orgName> under my command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 4">Fourth Corps</orgName> was under my own eye nearly all the time; and sometimes, in emergencies, I even gave orders directly to the subordinate commanders, without the formality of sending them through the corps commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>Hence I have spoken of that corps with the same freedom as of my own <num value="23" type="ordinal">Twenty-third</num>; and I hope I have not failed <pb id="p.229" n="229"/> to give, so far as the very restricted scope of my account would permit, full justice to that noble corps of veteran soldiers, as well as to its officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>As I have had special occasion to say of the action of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Opdycke,,,,," id="n0131.0012.00229.01730" reg="mostcommon:Opdycke,Emerson,,,:1"><surname>Opdycke</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> and of the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="KY16">16th Kentucky</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 23">Twenty-third Corps</orgName> at <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>, the conduct of those troops was beyond all praise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>I believe little disputes always arise out of the honorable rivalry which exists between bodies of troops acting together in a great battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>I was then, as I am now, perfectly satisfied with the sense of triumph which filled my soul when I saw my heroic comrades hurl back the hosts of rebellion with slaughter which to some might seem dreadful, but which I rejoiced in as being necessary to end that fratricidal war. It is not worth while to conceal the fact that most earnest patriotism sometimes arouses in the soldier's breast what might seem to be a fiendish desire to witness the slaughter of his country's enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>Only a soldier of fortune or a hireling can be a stranger to such feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>Yet I aver that I had not the slightest feeling of personal enmity toward my old friend and classmate <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0131.0012.00229.01733" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, or his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>It was the <q direct="unspecified">accursed politicians</q> who had led them into such a fratricidal strife who were the objects of our maledictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2654"/>It now appears to be fully established by the records that <orgName n="infantry"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00247.01904" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s infantry</orgName> force in the <rs n="Battle of Nashville" type="battle">battle of Nashville</rs> was very far inferior to that of <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00247.01905" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, and he had sent a large part of his cavalry, with some infantry, away to <placeName reg="Murfreesboroa">Murfreesboroa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>This disparity must have been perfectly well known to <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00247.01906" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, though not to <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00247.01907" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>Hence it would seem that <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00247.01908" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> must have known that it was utterly <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> impossible for his army to resist the assaults which he must expect on <dateStruct value="-12-16"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="16">16</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>Since all this has become known, it is impossible not to see now that the comparatively feeble resistance offered by the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> was due not so much, perhaps, to any lack of valor on the part of those troops, as to their comparatively small numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>I recall distinctly the conversation I had with a Confederate field-officer a few minutes after he was captured that day, and which I reported to <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0013.00248.01909" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2659"/>In answer to my question as to when the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops recognized the fact that they were beaten, he answered, <q direct="unspecified">Not till you routed us just now.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2660"/>I did not believe him then, for I thought they must have recognized their defeat at <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>, or at least on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="2">15th</day></dateStruct>, at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2661"/>But now I think he probably told me the exact truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2662"/>I doubt if any soldiers in the world ever needed so much cumulative evidence to convince them that they were beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2663"/><q direct="unspecified">Brave boys were they!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2664"/>If they had been fighting in a cause that commanded the sympathy and support of the public conscience of the world, they could never have been beaten; it is not necessary to search for any other cause of the failure of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2665"/>The most notable feature, on our side, of the battle of <dateStruct value="-12-16"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="16">16</day></dateStruct> was the wasting of nearly the entire day, so that operations ended with the successful assault at dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2666"/>What was left of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00248.01910" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had time to retreat across the <rs>Harpeth</rs> during the night and destroy the bridges before the pursuit could be commenced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>But the results of the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> operations at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> were too gratifying to admit of contemporaneous criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>The battle has been generally accepted as a perfect exemplification of the art of war. It is certainly a good subject for the study of military students, and it is partly for their benefit that I have pointed out some of its prominent defects as I understand them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>Its commendable <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> features are sufficiently evident; but in studying the actions that have resulted in victory, we are apt to overlook the errors without which the victory might have been far more complete, or even to mistake those errors for real causes of success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>The pursuit from <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> was necessarily an imperfect <num value="1">one</num> from the start, simply because the successful assault having been made at the close of day, the broken enemy had time to get across the <rs>Harpeth</rs> and destroy the bridges before morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>The singular blunder by which <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0013.00249.01911" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s pontoon-train was sent toward <placeName reg="Murfreesboroa">Murfreesboroa</placeName> instead of <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00249.01912" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> added somewhat to the delay, but probably did not essentially change the result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>The state of all the roads except the <num value="1">one</num> turnpike, the soft condition of the fields everywhere, the bad weather,&mdash; rain, sleet, and ice,&mdash;made the movements of troops which were necessary to an effective pursuit extremely difficult, and often impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>The energy and determination of <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0013.00249.01913" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> and of all who could take any active part in that pursuit were probably never surpassed in military history, but the difficulties to be overcome were often insurmountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>Under the conditions at that season of the year and in that state of weather, the only possible chance of reaping fruits commensurate with the brilliant victory at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> and with the great preparations which had been made for pursuit was to make the final assault at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> early enough in the day to leave time before dark to prevent the enemy from crossing the <rs>Harpeth</rs> and destroying the bridges.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>But this would have been difficult, if not impossible, to prevent on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="2">15th</day></dateStruct>, on account of the great extent and nature of the movements necessarily required to open the battle on that day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>As we sat together on horseback just in rear of <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00250.01917" reg="nearbymention:Wood,Frank,F.,,"><surname>Wood</surname></persName>'s right and of <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00250.01918" reg="nearbymention:Smith,A.,J.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s left, on ground overlooking nearly the entire field, the general would frequently reach for my glasses, which he had occasionally used before and said were the only field-glasses he had ever found of much use to him, and try to peer through the misty atmosphere far over the woods and fields where his infantry and cavalry were advancing against the enemy's left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>After thus looking long and earnestly, he would return the glasses to me, with what seemed to be a sign of irritation or impatience, for he uttered very few words in that long time, until late in the afternoon, when, after using my field-glasses for the last time, he said to me, with the energy which battle alone could arouse in his strong nature: <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0131.0013.00250.01919" reg="nearbymention:Smith,A.,J.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName> has not reached far enough to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>That he thought his chance a very brilliant <num value="1">one</num> is not remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>If he could cut off my retreat or force me to a pitched battle, he had full reason to hope for the most decisive results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>This fact should be given full weight in connection with the question why <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02006" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> did not avoid intrenched positions and make a raid into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, which he could easily have done at that time, because <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02007" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was not yet ready to meet him in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>The moral effect of such a raid would, of course, have been very great; but it must have proved disastrous in the end, for the reason that <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02008" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> would in a short time have had in <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02009" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s rear a far superior force to cut off his retreat and force him to a decisive battle; whereas if <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02010" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> could defeat and seriously cripple, if not destroy, the only organized army in the field then opposed to him, he could afterward attend to <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02011" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s scattered detachments in succession, or invade <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, as he might think expedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>As <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02012" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> was operating in the country of his own friends, he did not lack full and accurate information of the strength and movements of his adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>Indeed, we were also fully informed in due time of all of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02013" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s movements, but overestimated his strength because we did not have friends residing in his camps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>But the defeat of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02014" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>, and <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00259.02015" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s concentration of troops at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>, completely reversed the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>The artillery in the field is not specially considered <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> in any of these estimates, because it was ample in quantity and efficient in quality on both sides, and need not be compared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>This formidable army was now in <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02017" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s immediate front at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>, while the important strategic points of <placeName reg="Murfreesboroa">Murfreesboroa</placeName> and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> were strongly garrisoned and fortified, and the railroads strongly guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>It had become too late for <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02018" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> even to attempt a raid into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>But successful operations against <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> were far less possible to <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02020" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> than an invasion of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>While no commander could possibly think of destroying his own army by assaulting a fortified place in which the garrison was more than double his own strength, or indulge the hope of any valuable results from a less than half investment of such a place, so bold a commander as <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02021" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> might possibly attempt a raid into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, as the only thing he could possibly do except retreat across the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName>, and thus abandon his cause as lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>It was this view of the situation by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02022" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and the authorities in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> that caused such intense anxiety on account of the delay of <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02023" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> in attacking <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02024" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>It was perfectly evident that <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02025" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> could beat <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02026" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> whenever he chose to attack him, and that <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02027" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> must be fully aware of that fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>Hence it was naturally apprehended that <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02028" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> would either make a raid into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> or else retreat across the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName> without suffering any further damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>To those who were watching <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00260.02029" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> closely at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>, and especially to those who understood his character, there seemed no ground for either apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>All his operations indicated a serious attempt to besiege <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>, though it was impossible to imagine what he could hope to accomplish, unless it was to wait in the most convenient <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> place while his adversary, with all the great resources of the country at his back, got ready to crush him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>As stated in his report, <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00261.02030" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> estimated <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00261.02031" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s strength as being at least equal to his own, and with all the deliberation of his nature, he insisted upon making the full preparations which he considered essential to success not only in battle, but in pursuit of a defeated enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>From his point of view, <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00261.02032" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was unquestionably right in his action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>How he came to make so great an overestimate of the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> strength, in view of the means of information in his possession and the estimate <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00261.02033" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had given him before he started for <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, it is difficult to conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>But the fact is now beyond question that <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00261.02034" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> made all those elaborate preparations to attack an enemy of less than half his own strength, under the belief that his adversary was at least equal in strength to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>That <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00261.02035" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> then knew his own exact strength is a matter of course, and that he did not underestimate the strength of his adversary is almost equally certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>During the <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> in which his army lay in front of <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>, if not before, he must have ascertained very closely the strength of the <rs>Union</rs> forces in his front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>Hence <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00261.02036" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">siege</q> of <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> for <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> could not be regarded otherwise than as a stupendous farce, were it not for the desperate bravery with which he thus kept up the appearance of still fighting for a lost cause rather than be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to admit by his own action that it was indeed lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>It is now well known that the feeling among the <rs>Southern</rs> people and that of some of the highest officers of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> made it impossible for any officer of their army to admit in any public way the failure of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> until after the enforced surrender of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00261.02037" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:2"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>Indeed, it required much moral courage on the part of General <pb id="p.262" n="262"/> <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00262.02038" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:3"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> voluntarily to enter into a capitulation even after the capture of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00262.02039" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:2"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>This is unquestionably the explanation of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0014.00262.02040" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s desperate act in waiting in front of <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> and inviting the destruction or capture of his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>The crushing blow he there received was like a death-blow delivered by a giant full of strength and vigor upon a gladiator already beaten and reduced in strength nearly to exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>Any estimate of the <rs n="Battle of Nashville" type="battle">battle of Nashville</rs> which fails to take into account the foregoing facts must be essentially erroneous, and it is not doing any honor to the great soldier who fought that battle to compare it with his previous achievements when he heroically met and defeated superior numbers of fresh and vigorous troops.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>In the morning it was found that the enemy still held his position in our front, of which the hill in front of <persName n="Couch,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00269.02106" reg="mostcommon:Couch,N.,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Couch</surname></persName> was the key, and had thrown up considerable breastworks during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>In the histories of the <rs n="Battle of Nashville" type="battle">battle of Nashville</rs> heretofore published, it appears to have been assumed that the plan of battle issued to the troops before the movement of <dateStruct value="-12-15"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="15">15</day></dateStruct> was equally applicable to the operations of the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num>, was so understood by the subordinate commanders, and was the authoritative guide for their action during the entire day of the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>Hence it has seemed to me necessary to direct attention to the above extracts from the official records, as well as to give my own personal recollections, for the benefit of future historians.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>Unquestionably the <hi rend="italics">general plan</hi> of battle embraced in the orders of <dateStruct value="-12-14"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="14">14</day></dateStruct> for the attack on the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> was well applicable to the situation which actually existed in the morning of the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>It was requisite only to direct in what manner the several corps of the army should act in <hi rend="italics">concert</hi> in the <hi rend="italics">changed situation</hi> of both <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> armies, as had so clearly been done for the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>, in the <hi rend="italics">situation then existing</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>The only possible explanation of this very remarkable absence of timely orders from <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00271.02120" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> for the battle of <dateStruct value="-12-16"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="16">16</day></dateStruct>, and of the long delay on that day, seems to be found in his well-known constitutional habit, sometimes spoken of by his brother officers who had long been familiarly acquainted with him. Unless the opinions of those familiar acquaintances and friends were substantially erroneous, <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00271.02121" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s habit of great deliberation did not permit him to formulate in the night of <dateStruct value="-12-15"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="15">15</day></dateStruct> the comparatively simple orders requisite for the several corps to <hi rend="italics">resume</hi>, in the morning of the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct>, the movement <q direct="unspecified">against the enemy's left flank,</q> which he says he <q direct="unspecified">directed</q> to be <q direct="unspecified">continued</q> some time in <hi rend="italics">the afternoon</hi> of that day&mdash;so late, however, <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> that some of the troops at least, becoming impatient at the long delay, did not wait even for the orders they had asked for, but initiated on their own responsibility the action which resulted in victory before any directions whatever from <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00272.02122" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> had reached them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>However this may be, it seems to be clearly established by the records that the movements which prepared the way for the final assault, and that assault itself, were both made under the orders of subordinates, and not in obedience to any orders or directions from <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00272.02125" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, nor in accordance with any general plan which he had informed them was to be the guide for their action that day.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>But these little services, not worthy of mention in terms of special praise, seemed to me worthy of record, especially the latter, since I had made a long ride in a dark night, after having already been in the <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> saddle from daylight till dark, to carry that information to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> in person, and try to convince him of its correctness.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>A single word signifies sometimes much more than is imagined by him who uses it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>But the continuation, at <num value="3">3</num> or <time value="4pm">4 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>Indeed, when a military movement is suspended at nightfall on account of darkness, it is properly spoken of as <hi rend="italics">resumed</hi>, not <q direct="unspecified">continued,</q> even at daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>The word <q direct="unspecified">continued</q> was used to express what was directed to be done at <num value="3">three</num> or <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the afternoon&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">the movement against the enemy's left flank</q> which was not any movement that had been going on that day and which could therefore be continued, but the movement which, in fact, had ended the day before in a very important success which had materially altered the military situation under which the orders for the previous day had been given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>Hence this use of the word <q direct="unspecified">continued</q> furnishes food for thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>To have <hi rend="italics">resumed</hi>, some time in the afternoon, those operations of the preceding day would have been to state that they had been suspended, not only during the night on account of darkness, but during the greater part of the next day for no apparent reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>That would have been manifestly inconsistent with the theory that the operations of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day were only a continuation of those of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, all in accordance with the plan of battle published <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before, upon which theory the reports of <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0014.00274.02140" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> and of some of the sub-commanders appear to have been based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>I could not possibly have made a truthful and rational report which would have stood the test of just criticism without reference to the documents in that appendix; and it was far more respectful to <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00281.02187" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> simply to attach the documents, leaving him to make any explanations he might think necessary, than to call attention myself to the necessity for any such explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>It would have been impossible to give any rational explanation of the false position occupied <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> by the troops at <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName> up to the very last moment of safety except by reference to <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00282.02188" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s orders to <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00282.02189" reg="mostcommon:Stanley,Pulaski,,,:1"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> and me, and the subsequent correspondence on that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>The great tenacity with which I held on at <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName> and on the north bank of <placeName reg="Duck River, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098878">Duck River</placeName> could not have been justified except by reference to the despatches showing <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00282.02195" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s wishes and his assurance of reinforcements at those points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>If I had been free to do so, nothing could have been plainer than my duty to have fallen back behind the <rs>Harpeth</rs> when I found that <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00282.02196" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> could not or would not reinforce me on the line of <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Duck River</placeName>, and before <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00282.02197" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> could endanger my retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>It was not possible for me, without utter disregard for the truth of history as well as for my own military reputation, to attempt to conceal those facts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>It must seem remarkable that in my report, dated <dateStruct value="-12-7"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="7">7</day></dateStruct>, of operations from <dateStruct value="-11-14"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="14">14</day></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> <num value="1">1</num>, <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, including the <rs n="Battle of Franklin" type="battle">battle of Franklin</rs>, on which <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02199" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> placed his indorsement commending my <q direct="unspecified">skill,</q> no mention whatever was made of any orders or instructions from <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02200" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>The simple fact was that I could not have quoted the orders and instructions <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02201" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> had given me for my guidance during those operations without implied criticism of <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02202" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>; hence it was then thought best to omit any reference to any such orders or instructions, and to limit the report to a simple recital of the facts, thus making the report strictly truthful so far as concerned my own action and that of the troops under my command, without any reference whatever to my superior at <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 4" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>, under whose orders I was supposed to be acting; and that report of <dateStruct value="-12-7"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="7">7</day></dateStruct> appeared to be entirely satisfactory to <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02203" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> in that respect as well as in all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>But when the time came to make my final report of the entire campaign, which must go upon the public records as my full and exact contribution to the history of military operations in which I had taken an important part, truth and justice to all required me to make the record complete so far as lay in my power; and if there was anything in the record, as submitted by me to <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02204" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, to which he took exception, it was as plainly his duty to truth and justice to place those exceptions also on the public records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>So far from suggesting in my final report any possible criticism of <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02205" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, I put the best possible construction upon all the despatches I had received from him, by accepting them together as showing me that his object was <q direct="unspecified">to hold the enemy in check</q> until he (<persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02206" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>) could concentrate his reinforcements, and not to fight <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02207" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName>, as he (<persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00283.02208" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>) had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>I simply submitted to him the plain record, with the best possible construction I could put upon it, and that only so far as it was necessary for me to construe it to give the general basis of my action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>If <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> any official duty remained to be done in that regard, that duty devolved on <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00284.02209" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, not on me.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>The reinforcements thus expected were about equal to the force we then had in the field, and would make our entire force, when concentrated, equal, or somewhat superior, to that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>To effect this concentration was therefore of vital importance, a consideration to which all others were secondary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>This required that the enemy's advance should be delayed as much as possible, and at the same time a decisive battle avoided, unless it could be fought on favorable terms.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/></p> 
<p>I refrained from quoting either of the despatches from <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00284.02214" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>,&mdash;that dated <dateStruct value="-11-8"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="8">8</day></dateStruct> to <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0131.0015.00284.02215" reg="mostcommon:Stanley,Pulaski,,,:1"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, or that dated <num value="19">19</num>, repeating in substance that of the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>,&mdash;or my reply of <dateStruct value="-11-20"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="20">20</day></dateStruct> pointing out the reasons why the position at <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName> was a false <num value="1">one</num> to occupy under the circumstances; and I still think, as I then thought, that that was done as delicately as possible so as to avoid suggesting to <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0131.0015.00284.02216" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> that I thought his order a blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>His reply of the same date shows that he so appreciated it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>No obedience to any erroneous orders or instructions of his, sent from a distance whence the actual situation could not be seen as clearly as at the <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> front, could have justified me in case of failure.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>Since I had to fight, I sometimes regretted that I could not have a chance with a musket in the ranks (behind a good parapet and <q direct="unspecified">head-log,</q> of course!), for I was a remarkably good shot in my youth.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>Personal feeling in battle is sometimes remarkable, even to the person himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>In my own experience, the degree of danger was not often entirely unthought of; and in the comparatively few cases where it was, the actual danger was much the greatest ever experienced by me. That such should be the experience of a general in chief command, under the responsibilities of a great battle, is natural enough; but that the same should occur when there is little or no responsibility seems worthy of remark in reference to its apparent cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>In my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle,&mdash;that of <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n0131.0018.00363.03223" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,J.,H.,,:3"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s Creek,&mdash;where I was a staff officer under a soldier of great experience, ability, and unsurpassed courage,&mdash;<persName n="Lyon,General,,,," id="n0131.0018.00363.03224" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,Nathaniel,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName>,&mdash;I felt for a long time no sense of responsibility whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>I had only to convey his orders to the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>Yet the absorption of my mind in the discharge of this simple duty, and in watching the progress of the battle, was so complete that I absolutely had no thought whatever of self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/><pb id="p.364" n="364"/> My absolute confidence in my chief left no room in my mind for even such thoughts as those.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>It was not until wounds had produced discouragement in the bravest soul I ever knew that I was aroused to some sense of my own responsibility as his senior staff officer, and spontaneously said: <q direct="unspecified">No, general; let us try it again.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3701"/>This is the feeling that must dominate the action of every successful commander.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>It may not be a proper subject for criticism at this time, and certainly is not for any that might seem harsh or unkind, yet it is an instructive lesson which ought never to be forgotten, that feeling and passion sometimes more than reason, sound military principles, or wise statesmanship, dictated military as well as political policy during and long after the <rs>Civil War</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>No doubt all are now ready to admit this in respect to the political measures which wrought so much evil in the <rs>South</rs> during the so-called reconstruction period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3705"/>But those who are not familiar with the facts will, I think, be amazed when they see the evidences of this influence in military operations, and perhaps at no time more strikingly than during the last period of the <rs>Civil War</rs>. It would seem that the official correspondence of that period ought to be a sufficient warning to deter any future generation from bringing the country into a condition where even some of the most distinguished citizens, statesmen, and soldiers seem to be governed more by passion than by reason in the conduct of public affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>The inevitable horrors of war are bad enough in any <pb id="p.365" n="365"/> case, but they are vastly increased when the passions begotten of civil strife become dominant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3707"/>While all parts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have reason for pride in the manhood and valor of American soldiers, and in the patriotic devotion of citizens to the cause which they believed to be right, and profound gratitude for the restoration of the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName>, the people of this entire country should bow their heads in humiliation when they think of the general low state of civilization which made such a war possible, and much of its conduct the dictate of passion and hate rather than of reason or regard for the public good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3708"/>Even if it is true, as some soldier-statesmen have said, but which I do not believe, that occasional wars are necessary to the vitality of a nation,&mdash;necessary to keep up the fires of patriotism and military ardor upon which the national life depends,&mdash; let them be foreign and not civil wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>It is a great mistake, though apparently a common <num value="1">one</num>, to suppose that a country benefits ultimately, in some mysterious way, by civil war, in spite of all its losses during the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3710"/>It is, no doubt, true that the body politic, like the natural body, may in extreme cases be so diseased either by inheritance or from violation of natural laws, as to require the surgeon's knife to remove the diseased part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>being in command in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> at the close of the war, I was connected for a short period with the very earliest consideration of the vital question of the restoration of civil government in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, in which I acted a more important part at a later period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>The moment the surrender of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0131.0019.00367.03230" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> made it evident that the end was near, the question arose, and was much discussed among some of the prominent officers, as to the status of the negroes in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>The position was promptly taken by me, as the responsible commander in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, that the question at that time was solely <num value="1">one</num> of fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3720"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s proclamation of emancipation was virtually a military order to the army to free all the slaves in the insurgent States as rapidly as military operations should bring them within its control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>Whatever the legal effect of the proclamation upon the status of slaves not within the reach of the army when it was issued, there could be no question of its binding obligation, as an order to the army, to be executed and made practically effective as rapidly as it came within the power of the army to execute it. Accordingly, the following order was issued by me to give full practical effect to the proclamation, and <pb id="p.368" n="368"/> to maintain the freedom of all former slaves, so long as the subject-matter should remain under military control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>This order, which was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> public official declaration on the subject, was mentioned by <num value="1">one</num> of the leading journals of New York at the time as having at least the merit of <q direct="unspecified">saving a world of discussion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3823"/>My <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> reason for objecting to the proposition is the absolute unfitness of the negroes, as a class, for any such responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3826"/>They do not even know the meaning of the freedom that has been given them, and are much astonished when informed that it does not mean that they are to live in idleness and be fed by the government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>It is true they are docile, obedient, and anxious to learn; but we certainly ought to teach them something before we give them an equal voice with ourselves in government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>This view is so fully recognized as correct by all who are familiar, by actual contact, with the negro character and condition, that argument seems superfluous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>I have yet to see a single <num value="1">one</num> among the many Union men in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> who would willingly submit for a moment to the immediate elevation of the negro to political equality with the white man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>They are all, or nearly all, content with the abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3831"/>Many of them are rejoiced that it is done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3832"/>But to raise the negro, in his present ignorant and degraded condition, to be their political equals would be, in their opinion, to enslave them [the white citizens].

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3833"/>A government so organized would in no sense be a popular government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3834"/>After careful consideration of all the questions involved, I am fully convinced as to the best policy to be adopted in this State, which I will submit in outline:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3835"/>A <rs type="role" reg="military-Governor">military governor</rs> to be appointed, who shall have command of all the troops in the <rs>State</rs>; or the department commander be authorized to assume, by virtue of his command, the functions of military governor, which naturally devolve upon him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3836"/>The <rs type="role" reg="military-Governor">military governor</rs> to declare the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of the <rs>State</rs> in force immediately preceding the pretended Act of Secession (so far as the same are not inconsistent with the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the war proclamations of the <rs>President</rs>) to be still in force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>To make provisional appointments of justices of the peace, sheriffs, and such other inferior officers as the <rs>State</rs> laws empower the governor to appoint, to serve until the organization of a civil government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>To order an enrolment of all electors who may take the <rs>President</rs>'s amnesty oath.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>As soon as this enrolment shall be completed, to call an election for delegates to a <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State convention</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>The qualifications of voters and candidates to be those prescribed by the <rs>State</rs> laws, and that they shall take the amnesty oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>All acts of the convention to be submitted to the people, for their ratification or rejection, at the same time with the election of governor and members of the legislature, which would be ordered by the convention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>I would confidently expect a convention, so chosen, to repudiate the doctrine of secession, abolish slavery, and fully restore the <rs>State</rs> to its practical constitutional relations to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>The people are now ripe for such action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>They only ask to know what the government desires them to do, and how they are to do it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>If, however, they should fail to do this, I would regard them as having violated their oaths, would dissolve the convention, and hold the <rs>State</rs> under military government until the people should come to their senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>I would have a lawful popular government or a military government&mdash;the latter being a necessary substitute in the absence of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3946"/>A great people who have heretofore lived under a government so mild that they were scarcely aware of its existence have found, in time of war, that government to be <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest in the world [cheers], raising and maintaining armies and navies vaster than any ever before known [cheers].

This was the grandest lesson of the war. It shows that the power of a nation to maintain its dignity and integrity does not result from or depend upon its form of government; that the greatest national strength&mdash;the power to mass the largest armies in time of war&mdash;is entirely consistent with the broadest liberty of the citizen in time of peace [enthusiasm].

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3977"/>I have since heard it discussed very freely by many prominent men of all shades of political opinion, among others <persName><roleName n="Prince">the Prince</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3978"/>All seem to recognize the falsity of the <rs>Emperor</rs>'s assumptions where he says: <q direct="unspecified">In <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> the government founded by the will of the people is consolidating itself,</q> etc. Yet his statements are, no doubt, believed by a large majority of the <rs>French</rs> people, and therefore afford him a very good reason for yielding to the demand, made in common by the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 5" reg="france">France</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, that his intervention in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> shall be brought to an end.

While we laugh at the absurdity of his premises, we can hardly find fault with his conclusion, and hence it is not worth while to criticize any part of his argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/>Rather I think it well to let him make the most of his audacity in the creation of convenient facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>The opinion seems to be universal here that the <rs>Emperor</rs> is sincere in his declarations of intention as to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; indeed, that the has adopted the policy of making the strongest possible bid for the friendship of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>The State had yet to obtain from Congress a recognition of its government, which recognition was understood to depend upon the ratification by the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State legislature</orgName> of the then pending <num value="14" type="ordinal">Fourteenth</num> Amendment to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>This subject was very fully discussed between me and the leading members of the legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>I advised them to accept the proposed amendment as the only means of saving the <rs>State</rs> from the more <q direct="unspecified">radical</q> reconstruction under act of Congress, which was then threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>It was urged that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would not suffer much from the operation of the <num value="14" type="ordinal">Fourteenth</num> Amendment, because of the general intelligence of her white population and their <pb id="p.395" n="395"/> superiority in numbers over the negroes&mdash;advantages which some of the other Southern States did not enjoy; that if the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia legislature</orgName> would ratify the pending amendment, Congress could not refuse to recognize the existing State government and make it permanent; and that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would thus be restored at once to her full privileges as a State in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>It fell to my lot to command the <orgName type="district" n="district 1">First Military District</orgName>, into which <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was converted by the act of Congress.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>The terrible oppression of the <rs>Southern</rs> people embodied in those acts of Congress has hardly been appreciated <pb id="p.396" n="396"/> by even the most enlightened and conservative people of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4029"/>Only those who actually suffered the baneful effects of the unrestrained working of those laws can ever realize their full enormity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4030"/>The radical Congress was not content to impose upon the <rs>Southern States</rs> impartial suffrage to whites and blacks alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4031"/>They were not content even to disfranchise the leading rebels, according to the terms of the <num value="14" type="ordinal">Fourteenth</num> Amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>Even those would not be sufficient to put the <rs>Southern</rs> whites under the domination of their former slaves and of adventurers from the <rs>North</rs>, and thus to secure the radical supremacy in the reconstructed States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>Hence another and an enormous stride was taken, with the purpose of putting those States under what became known as <q direct="unspecified"><rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs></q> governments, so offensive as to be nearly intolerable even to their authors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>That stride consisted in imposing the so-called <q direct="unspecified">iron-clad oath</q> upon all officers, of whatever grade or character, in all the former <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>That oath excluded from office not only all who had in any way taken active part in the rebellion, but even the most constant Union men of the <rs>South</rs> who had remained at home during the war; for not <num value="1">one</num> of them had escaped <q direct="unspecified">giving aid or comfort</q> in some way to those engaged in the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>Even so conspicuous a loyalist as <persName n="Rives,Judge,,,," id="n0131.0021.00396.03341" reg="mostcommon:Rives,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName>, afterward <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> district judge, declared, after mature deliberation, that he could not take that oath, although his constant fidelity to the <rs>Union</rs> was known to all in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>I asked this noted Union man to accept the office of chief justice of the <rs>State</rs>, but he could not take the prescribed oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>He had permitted his boy, about to join the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, to take <num value="1">one</num> of his horses rather than see him go afoot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>Perhaps the judge was too conscientious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>But it was the evil effect of the law to exclude the highly honorable and let the rascals in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>And thus, although the acts of Congress permitted a majority of the whites to vote, their choice of officers was restricted to negroes and <q direct="unspecified">carpet-baggers</q>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>To these latter, therefore, was committed the entire work of organizing and administering the <rs>Southern State</rs> governments, which required the aid of the <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4088"/>dear General: In spite of every effort that could be made to prevent it, the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName> has adhered to its proscriptive measures, or rather to the most objectionable of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4089"/>After every other means had failed, I even went so far as to visit the <rs>Convention</rs> and urge the repeal of the test oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4090"/>But what I said seemed not to have the slightest influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4091"/>I inclose a newspaper report, which is a pretty accurate <num value="1">one</num>, of what I said, and which will show that I have at least done my duty in that regard, if not more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4092"/>The same baneful influence that secured the election of a majority of ignorant blacks, and equally ignorant or unprincipled whites, to the <rs>Convention</rs>, has proved sufficient to hold them firmly to their original purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4093"/>They could only hope to obtain office by disqualifying everybody in the <rs>State</rs> who is capable of discharging official duties, and all else to them was of comparatively slight importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4094"/>Even the question whether their Constitution will be ratified or rejected, they treat with indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4095"/>Congress, they say, will make it all right anyway. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4096"/>Of course I may be mistaken, but my opinion is that the <rs>Constitution</rs> must be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4097"/>This would not be a serious matter if it (the <rs>Constitution</rs>) were a good <num value="1">one</num>, and good officers could be elected under it. But it seems hardly possible that the <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName> can organize upon a satisfactory basis for the election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4098"/>The negroes and their associates will doubtless insist <pb id="p.401" n="401"/> upon unqualified indorsement of the <rs>Constitution</rs> by their nominees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4099"/>This the respectable whites will not give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4100"/>Hence the late Convention will be reproduced in the legislature, a large majority being either worthless radicals, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, or bitter opponents of reconstruction upon the congressional plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/>The danger is that we will have on our hands, not only <num value="1">one</num> big elephant in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but a host of little ones in the shape of officers-elect who are not fit to be installed&mdash;a prospect not very encouraging, at least.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4102"/>My impression is that the wisest course would be to let the thing fall and die where it is&mdash;not submit it to the people at all. We can then go on putting Union men in office and reorganizing the provisional government upon a loyal basis, until the friends of reconstruction get control of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4103"/>Then a convention can be called which will frame a Constitution fit to be ratified by the people of the <rs>State</rs> and approved by Congress and the country at large.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>If Congress would give a little more latitude in the selection of officers, by modifying the test oath, there would be no difficulty in filling all the offices in the <rs>State</rs> with men who would aid restoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>Without some such change, the work of reorganization cannot be carried very far. The view of the question which I have given above is, of course, the local <num value="1">one</num>; but it seems to me the national <num value="1">one</num> leads to the same conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>I can't see how the indorsement of such a Constitution as this <num value="1">one</num>, by the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, can be otherwise than damaging to them in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4107"/>Would it not be wise for Congress to say at once, We reject, once and for all, proscriptive constitutions?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4108"/>I have written this letter merely to suggest points that occur to me as worthy of very careful consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4109"/>I suppose Congress alone can determine what is to be done.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/>As explained in my official letter to-day, I feel bound to await the action of Congress before ordering an election.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4115"/>As was to be expected, and in spite of any influence which the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commander</rs> could properly exert, that proposed Constitution, like those framed in the other States, perpetuated the worst features of the acts of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4116"/>It disqualified all the respectable whites from any active part in the government, leaving the negroes and <q direct="unspecified">carpet-baggers</q> full sway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4117"/>So sweeping was this disqualification that in many parts of the <rs>State</rs> not a native Virginian, <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs>, could be found who could read or write, and who would be eligible for election or appointment to any office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4118"/>In my great anxiety to save the <rs>State</rs> from so great an evil, I went to the hall of the <rs>Convention</rs> and explained the impossibility of organizing a government under such a Constitution, and besought the <rs>Convention</rs> to strike out the disqualifying clause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4119"/>I was listened to with cold respect, my advice was disregarded, and promptly after my departure the <rs>Constitution</rs> was finally adopted, and the <rs>Convention</rs> adjourned <hi rend="italics">sine die</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4120"/>But the <rs>State</rs> was, nevertheless, saved from the impending disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4121"/>The act of Congress required that the <rs>Constitution</rs> be submitted to the people for ratification or rejection; but Congress had failed to appropriate money to pay the expenses of an election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4122"/>If an election was to be held, the money must be taken from the treasury of the <rs>State</rs>, by the order of the district commander, or else Congress must make a special appropriation for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4123"/>I declined to sanction the use of the people's money for any such purpose, refused to order an election for ratification or rejection of the obnoxious Constitution, and referred the matter to Congress, with a recommendation that the people be authorized to vote separately on the disqualifying clause&mdash;a privilege which the <rs>Convention</rs> had denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4124"/><pb id="p.403" n="403"/></p> 
<p>The radicals in Congress were so glad, apparently, of this mode of escape from a result so obnoxious to the better sense of the <rs>Union</rs> people at that time, that not a voice was raised in favor of the <q direct="unspecified"><rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs></q> Constitution or in disapprobation of my action in regard to it. The instrument was permitted to rest quietly in the pigeonhole of the district commander's desk until the next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4125"/>Then an act was passed providing for submitting that Constitution to the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, with the privilege of voting separately on the disfranchising clause, which clause they, of course, rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4126"/>Thus <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was saved from the vile government and spoliation which cursed the other Southern States, and which the same radical Congress and its successors sustained until the decent public sentiment of the <rs>North</rs> would endure them no longer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4127"/>It is, perhaps, not too much to say that if the other district commanders had in like manner refused to make themselves parties to the spoliation of the people placed under their charge, Congress would have shrunk from the direct act of imposing upon them such obnoxious governments, and the country might have been saved the disgrace of the <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> of <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs> rule in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4128"/>At least it is certain that a large proportion of the more moderate among the <rs>Republican</rs> majority in Congress at that time indulged the hope that respectable governments might be organized under the acts of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4129"/>But they made this difficult, if not impossible, when they gave their assent to the amendment of those acts, prepared by the extremist radicals, depriving the <rs>Southern</rs> whites of any active part in the organization of their governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4130"/>Impartial justice, as expressed in <q direct="unspecified">impartial suffrage,</q> might have led to tolerable results even in those States where the blacks were in the majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4131"/>But under a law which gave universal suffrage to the blacks and disfranchised the influential <pb id="p.404" n="404"/> whites, any tolerable result was impossible unless under the administration of a man who had the independence and courage to disarm such a law of its poisonous sting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4132"/>However this may be, it is certain that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> owes her escape from the sad fate of her sister States to the action of her district commander, who has abundant reason for the belief that the good people of that State fully appreciated the fact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4133"/>With this service to the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, my duty in that State practically terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4134"/>The impeachment trial of <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0131.0021.00404.03346" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had reached its crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4135"/>It had become evident to those who were wise enough to discern the <q direct="unspecified">signs of the times</q> that the <name>Senate</name> would probably not sustain the articles of impeachment by the necessary <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4136"/>This would leave unsettled the quarrel between the <rs>President</rs> and Congress over the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and that on the eve of an exciting Presidential election, in which several of the newly reconstructed States were expected to take part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4137"/>In not <num value="1">one</num> of these States was the new government able to stand alone or to preserve the peace within its borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4138"/>A firm and impartial administration of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> in the sole interest of peace and order during the coming contest was the <num value="1">one</num> indispensable want of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4139"/>Without that, a revival of civil strife seemed inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4140"/>Under these circumstances, I was urged to accept the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs></orgName>, with the assurance that in this way the contest which endangered the peace of the country could be adjusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4141"/>I gave my consent, the nomination was promptly sent to the <name>Senate</name>, and that body, in spite of its very large majority in opposition to the <rs>President</rs>, confirmed the appointment with almost entire unanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4142"/>The impeachment was dismissed, and that dangerous farce, which had come within <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> votes of inflicting lasting disgrace upon the country, happily came to an end. <pb id="p.405" n="405"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4151"/>During their long absence from the capital neither of these generals could exercise any appreciable influence over either the administration or the command of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4153"/>It is no reflection upon the many eminent, patriotic citizens who have held the war portfolio to say that the very few men who have proved unworthy of that great trust would have been much less likely to do serious harm to the public interests if they had been under the watchful eye of a jealous old soldier, like <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0131.0022.00407.03353" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> or <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0022.00407.03354" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who was not afraid of them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4155"/>The cause of this trouble has seemed to be inherent in the form and character of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4157"/>It is manifestly indispensable that the executive head of a government be clothed with this authority.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4160"/>The art of war has in all ages called forth the highest order of genius and character, the great captains of the world having been esteemed as among the greatest men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4179"/>By such means the <rs>President</rs> could have actually exercised the chief command imposed upon him by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, sharing in due measure with his chief military officer the responsibilities imposed by their high offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4182"/>It is only in this country, where the chief of state has generally no military training, and his war minister the same, that a chief of staff of the army is supposed to be unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4232"/>He said: <q direct="unspecified">A majority of Republicans in both houses of Congress and throughout the country now regret the commencement of the impeachment proceedings, since they find how slight is the evidence of guilty intent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4233"/>But now the serious question is, how to get out of the scrape?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4234"/>A judgment of guilty and removal of the <rs>President</rs> would be ruinous to the party, and cause the political death of every senator who voted for it as soon as the country has time to reflect upon the facts and appreciate the frivolous character of the charges upon which the removal must be based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>I have no means of knowing to what extent, if any, the <name>Senate</name> was influenced by this nomination, but anxiety about the ultimate result seemed to be soon allayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4277"/>About a month later a vote was taken in the <name>Senate</name>, and the impeachment failed; my nomination was then confirmed, as stated at the time, by a nearly unanimous vote of the <name>Senate</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4278"/>I entered upon the duties of the office as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> on the <dateStruct value="-06-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, and continued to discharge them until a few days after <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00419.03474" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s inauguration in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4279"/>I was greeted very cordially by the <rs>President</rs>, by all the members of his cabinet, by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00419.03475" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and by a large number of senators who called upon me at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4280"/>The duties devolved upon me were often of a very delicate character, and it required at times no little tact to avoid serious trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/><persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0131.0022.00419.03476" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s views were sometimes in direct conflict with those which I felt compelled to maintain under the acts of Congress affecting the <name>States</name> lately in rebellion; but it is due to the memory of <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0131.0022.00419.03477" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> to say that he did not at any time require me to do anything contrary to my interpretation of the acts of Congress, and that he in general acquiesced without objection in all the measures I deemed necessary to preserve the peace and secure a fair vote of the newly enfranchised citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs> in the <name>Presidential</name> election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>The cordial assistance of <persName n="Evarts,Mister,,,," id="n0131.0022.00419.03478" reg="nearbymention:Evarts,W.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Evarts</surname></persName> as <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> was a great help to me in such matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4283"/>When he was present I had little difficulty in respect to the law involved in any question; but when he happened to be absent, and I was compelled to stand alone against all the cabinet, or all who chose to take any interest in the question, it was hard work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4284"/>But I always carried the day&mdash;at least, in act if not in argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> never decided against me. He thus fulfilled to the letter the implied <pb id="p.420" n="420"/> promise made when he submitted my nomination to the <name>Senate</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>If there ever had been any real ground for the widespread apprehension of criminal purpose on the part of <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0131.0022.00420.03479" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, certainly all indication of any such purpose disappeared with the failure of his impeachment and the settlement of the long-standing controversy respecting the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>The so-called reconstruction laws, which the <rs>President</rs> so emphatically condemned as being unconstitutional, were carried out without further objection from him; the <name>Presidential</name> election in the <rs>Southern States</rs> was conducted with perfect good order; a free ballot and a full count were secured under the supervision and protection of the army&mdash;a thing supposed to be so dangerous to the liberties of a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>This and many other examples in the history of this country, from the time when <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0131.0022.00420.03480" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:2"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> surrendered his commission to the <orgName n="Continental Congress" type="congress">Continental Congress</orgName> down to the present time, show that a <q direct="unspecified">free people</q> have nothing to fear from their army, whether regular, volunteer, or militia; the soldiers are, in fact, among the most devoted and loyal citizens of the republic, and thoroughly imbued with the fundamental principle of subordination of the military to the civil power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>With <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00420.03481" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> my relations while in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> were of the most satisfactory character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>As a candidate for the <name>Presidency</name>, and as <rs type="role" reg="President elect">President-elect</rs>, he naturally desired to be as free as possible from the current duties of his office as general of the army, and he was absent from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> much of the time, his chief of staff, <persName n="Rawlins,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00420.03482" reg="mostcommon:Rawlins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rawlins</surname></persName>, remaining there to promulgate orders in his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/>Thus it devolved upon me to exercise all the functions of <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the army</q>&mdash;functions which it is usually attempted to divide among <num value="3">three</num>,&mdash;the <rs>President</rs>, the <rs>Secretary</rs> of <pb id="p.421" n="421"/> War, and the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>,&mdash;without any legal definition of the part which belongs to each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>Of course <q direct="unspecified">the machine</q> ran very smoothly in the <num value="1">one</num> case, though there had been much friction in the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>In compliance with the wish of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03483" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, I remained in office under him for a few days, for the purpose of inaugurating the system which he hoped would end the long-standing controversy between the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and the headquarters of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>The order which was issued assigning <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03484" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> to command the entire army, staff as well as line, was prepared by me under <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03485" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s instructions, and the draft of the order was approved by him as expressing the views he had maintained when he was general-in-chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>As <rs type="role2">President</rs> he very soon yielded to the opposite views, and caused the order to be amended accordingly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>That <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03486" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> then entertained views of his authority which were too broad, as <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03487" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had also done, is no doubt true; but it ought not to have been very difficult to correct such errors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>It was easier to take away all administrative authority and all command over the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> of the army, and the latter course was adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>The ancient controversy was up to <dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct> no nearer settlement than it was in <dateStruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct>, though in <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03488" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s time some progress had been made in the persistent efforts to deprive the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> of the little authority which had been left to <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03489" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>. <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03490" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> had, with his usual gallantry and confidence, renewed the contest, but had been worsted in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encounter with the <rs>Secretary</rs>, and then gave up the struggle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>Upon my assignment to the <q direct="unspecified">command of the army</q> in <dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct>, I determined to profit so far as possible by the unsatisfactory experience of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03491" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03492" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03493" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00421.03494" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>&mdash;at least so far as to avoid further attempts to accomplish the impossible, which attempts <pb id="p.422" n="422"/> have usually the result of accomplishing little or nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>In fact, long study of the subject, at the instance of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00422.03495" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00422.03496" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, earnest efforts to champion their views, and knowledge of the causes of their failure, had led me to the conclusion heretofore suggested, namely, that under the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> an actual military commander of the army is not possible, unless in an extreme emergency like that which led to the assignment of <persName n="Grant,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0131.0022.00422.03497" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>; and that the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, or nominal commanding general, can at most be only a <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="Chief of Staff">chief of staff</rs>,</q>&mdash;that or nothing, &mdash;whatever may be the mere title under which he may be assigned to duty by the <rs>President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>As the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step in the experimental course decided upon, I sent an order in writing to the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>, directing him never, under any circumstances, to issue an order dictated by me, or in my name, without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> laying it before the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>; and I made it known to all the staff that I disclaimed the right to issue any order to the army without the knowledge of the <rs>President</rs> or the <rs>Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>I also forbade the issuing of any order in my name without my knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rule was easy, the latter very difficult, to enforce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>I found, with no little surprise, that the office of the <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs></q> usually learned for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time of routine orders issued in his name by seeing them published in the New York papers the next day; and it was quite difficult at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to make it distinctly understood that such a practice could not be tolerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>In fact, it became necessary to call attention to the question of veracity involved in such a use of the general's name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>Such was the condition the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> had reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs> had acquired the habit of issuing nearly all orders to the army without the knowledge of any <num value="1">one</num> of his superiors&mdash;the <rs>President</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, or the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>In fact, the adjutantgeneral <pb id="p.423" n="423"/> had in practice come very near being <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/></p> 
<p>Some time and much patience were required to bring about the necessary change, but ere long the result became very apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>Perfect harmony was established between the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and the headquarters of the army, and this continued, under the administrations of <persName n="Proctor,Secretary,,,," id="n0131.0022.00423.03498" reg="mostcommon:Proctor,Redfield,,,:1"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretaries</roleName> <surname>Proctor</surname></persName>, <persName n="Elkins,Secretary,,,," id="n0131.0022.00423.03499" reg="mostcommon:Elkins,Stephen,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Secretary"></roleName><surname>Elkins</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Lamont,Secretary,,,," id="n0131.0022.00423.03500" reg="mostcommon:Lamont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary"></roleName><surname>Lamont</surname></persName>, up to the time of my retirement from active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>The orders issued were actually the <rs>President</rs>'s orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4313"/>No matter by whom suggested or by whom formulated, they were in their final form understandingly dictated by the <rs>President</rs>, and sent to the army in his name by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>, thus leaving no possible ground for question as to the constitutional authority under which they were issued, nor of the regularity of the method, in conformity with army regulations, by which they were communicated to the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>It is, I think, to be hoped that the system thus begun may be fully developed and become permanent, as being the best practicable solution of a long-standing and dangerous controversy, and as most in accord with the fundamental principles of our constitutional government, under which the <rs>President</rs>, whether a soldier or a civilian, is in fact as well as in name the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the army and navy. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4394"/>The policy of the preceding king had been annexation to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; but the new sovereign and his advisers were opposed to that policy, although very friendly to <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0131.0023.00432.03540" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, and largely controlled by their influence in governmental affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4395"/>It was manifest that the question of annexation ought not to be discussed at that time, but that action ought to be taken at once to secure to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the exclusive right to the use of <placeName reg="Pearl River harbor">Pearl River harbor</placeName> for naval purposes, and to prepare the way to make annexation to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> sure in due time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4397"/>The continuous and rapid decay of all the ancient families of chiefs, from which alone would the people ever think of electing a king or a queen, and the notorious corruption in blood and character of the few remaining half-castes nominally belonging to those ancient families, made it plain to all that the monarchical government must soon die a natural death, or become so intolerably corrupt as to make its overthrow inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4399"/>While perfectly faithful to that government, they <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> had lost none of their love for their native country, and looked forward with confidence to the time when the islands, like ripe fruit, should fall into the lap of their beloved mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4400"/>These American Hawaiians were men of very high character, and much above the average of intelligence even in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4401"/>They had no desire to force the ripening of the fruit, but were perfectly content to bide the course of nature, which must of necessity produce the result in no long time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4402"/>It seems to me a very narrow view of the intelligence of the people of this country which suggests any serious difficulty in the government of outlying possessions which are essential military and naval outposts simply because their heterogeneous populations are not yet capable of self-government, or fit for admission to the <rs>Union</rs> as a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4403"/>If the <name>Territorial</name> system to which the country is accustomed is not appropriate in any special case, and the prejudice against a military government is regarded as insurmountable, we have an example in the present government of the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of the best and most economical in the world,&mdash;which would require very slight modification to make it perfectly applicable to any of the islands of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, the <rs>Pacific</rs>, or the gulf which may be acquired by this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4404"/>I do not believe any man worthy of the title of statesman will admit for a moment that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> cannot govern, and govern well, any national outposts or other possessions which the interests of the country may require it to hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4405"/>In fact, it seems an almost self-evident proposition that a government, under exclusive national authority, exercised over comparatively small districts of country and small population, under the constant observation of the people and public press of the entire country, is more likely to be just and pure than any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4406"/>Responsibility to a local constituency undoubtedly has great advantages, but responsibility to <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> the government and entire people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has vastly greater.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4408"/>I believe now that the highest external incentive to honorable conduct anywhere in the world is that of responsibility to the government and the whole people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4409"/>There need be no apprehension that any American who has a national reputation at stake will be guilty of any of the crimes which are said to stain the administration of viceroys in some parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4410"/>The prejudice which still exists in this country in respect to military government is due solely to the fact that the people do not yet appreciate the legitimate influence which they themselves exercise over their public servants, military no less than civil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4411"/>Indeed, there is perhaps no other class of citizens so sensitive to public criticism as those in the military service, certainly none who value more highly their reputation for faithful and honorable conduct in the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>I do not hesitate to give it as my deliberate judgment, based upon the experience of half a century, that the best and most satisfactory government any island of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName> can have in the next <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> will be a military government under an officer of the <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4413"/>It is only an incident of despotic governments, past or present, that soldiers have been employed to execute despotic orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4414"/>The common inference that military government is essentially despotic is absolutely false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4415"/>On the contrary, military men are, as a rule, the most humane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4416"/>This has been most notably so in the history <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4417"/>Almost without exception, the soldiers of all grades in the <rs>Union</rs> army desired to treat the conquered <rs>South</rs> with all possible kindness and humanity, while the men who inflicted upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people the worst form of cruelty were men who had never fought a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4418"/>There have been some cruel soldiers in the world, many more cruel men who were not soldiers except perhaps in name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4419"/>Men of that character generally avoid danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4420"/>What mankind has most to dread is the placing of military power in the hands of men who are not real soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>They are quite sure to abuse it in <num value="1">one</num> way or the other, by cruelty to their own men, or else to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>The same disregard for human life which induces an ignorant man to take command of troops and send them to useless slaughter may well manifest itself in barbarity toward prisoners of war or non-combatants; but a real soldier is never guilty of either of those crimes, which seem to me alike among the greatest in military experience.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/>my dear General: I was not taken entirely by surprise by your despatch relative to the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> superintendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4474"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00440.03563" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> mentioned the subject to me soon after the war, and army officers since that time have spoken of it often enough to keep me in mind of the fact that I might some time be called upon to assume that responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4475"/>Yet it is with a strong feeling of reluctance that I have brought myself to regard <pb id="p.441" n="441"/> it as a thing to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4476"/>This feeling results from several causes, which I desire to explain to you, while I know you will give me credit for a desire to do what appears best for the public service, and satisfactory to all concerned, without too much concern for my own personal preferences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4477"/>In the first place, I have no little doubt of the possession of any special fitness for that position, and have pretty strong appreciation of its difficulties and importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4478"/>I do not feel at all confident that the flattering expectations of my friends will be realized from my management of the academy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4479"/>I have been there enough to know pretty well how difficult a post that of superintendent is, and how varied the good qualities a man ought to possess to fit him in all respects for it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4480"/>Rank and reputation will of course be of some assistance, but their good effect will be greatly impaired without the dignity of command belonging to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4481"/>To transfer an officer of rank from a high command and post of great responsibility and trust to <num value="1">one</num> heretofore regarded as appropriate to an inferior grade, may be regarded as elevating the dignity of the new command, but looks much more like degrading the officer, and to that extent impairs the good effect desired to be produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4482"/>Besides, it is impossible for any officer not to <hi rend="italics">feel</hi> that in taking such inferior command, although it is even for the avowed purpose of raising its dignity, that he is stooping to do so. Especially must both these effects be produced when the assignment is only an executive act. If it was done in pursuance of law, the case would be materially different. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4483"/>We were all delighted at the news of your return to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and the prospect of your restoration to the proper duties and authority of general of the army; and I sincerely hope the events to occur this week, alluded to in your telegram to-day, may be such as to justify you in taking the course universally desired by the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4484"/>We want our general where he can best look after all the interests of the military service, with power to command the army in fact as well as in name.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4485"/>I have read with the greatest pleasure your capital speech to the <name>Knights</name> of St. Patrick.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4486"/>Please present my respectful compliments to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and my kindest regards to the <rs>President</rs>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4488"/>During the <rs>Civil War</rs> the demand for the services in the field of the most capable officers had, as was generally understood, been prejudicial to the interests of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName>; and this continued some time after the close of the war, in consequence of the unusual increase of rank of those officers who were known to be fitted in all respects for the head of that institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4489"/>This difficulty was increased by the very unreasonable notion that because the law had opened the academy to the line of the army, the superintendent must necessarily be taken from the line, and not from the corps of engineers, although the latter contained many officers of appropriate rank who had then added to their high scientific ability and attainments distinguished services in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4490"/>Even in the line, officers were not wanting of appropriate rank, character, ability, education, and experience to qualify them for the duties of superintendent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4491"/>For example, my immediate predecessor, <persName n="Ruger,Major-General,Thomas,H.,," id="n0131.0024.00442.03565" reg="default:Ruger,Thomas,H.,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Ruger</surname></persName>, then a colonel of infantry, was in all respects highly qualified for that office; and when I relieved him I found the academy in about the same state of efficiency which had characterized it before the war. There was, in fact, at that time little, if any, foundation for the assumption that the interests of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName> required the assignment of any officer of higher rank than colonel to duty as superintendent of the academy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4492"/>Of course I did not know this before I went there, and it was a matter for the judgment of my superiors, whose duty, and not mine, it was to know the facts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4493"/>But <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00442.03566" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had other reasons, some of them very cogent in his own estimation at least, for desiring my presence somewhere in the <rs>Eastern States</rs>; and the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> <q direct="unspecified">detail</q> was the only way in which that could readily be brought about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4494"/>He had just been restored, or was about to be, to the actual command of the <pb id="p.443" n="443"/> army, after having been practically suspended from command a long time because of his differences with the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4495"/>He desired especially to bring the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName> under his command, and appears to have been assured of <persName n="Grant,President,,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03567" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s support in that regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4496"/><persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03568" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> also wished me to revise the army regulations, so as to incorporate the theory of relation between the administration and the command which he and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03569" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had maintained as the true <num value="1">one</num>, but which had generally, if not always, been opposed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretaries of War</rs> and by the chiefs of staff departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4497"/>These were doubtless the principal reasons for <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03570" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s anxiety to have me accept the assignment to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4498"/>But very soon after my arrival in the <rs>East</rs> I found that I was also expected to preside over a board of review in the case of <persName n="Porter,General,Fitz-John,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03571" reg="default:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Fitz-John</foreName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> and in that of <persName n="Hammond,Surgeon General,William,A.,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03572" reg="default:Hammond,William,A.,,"><roleName n="Surgeon General">Surgeon-General</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Hammond</surname></persName>; and that my junior in rank, MajorGen-eral <persName n="McDowell,,Irvin,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03573" reg="default:McDowell,Irvin,,,"><foreName>Irvin</foreName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, could not be given a command appropriate to his rank unless it was the division which I had consented to vacate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4499"/>Of course I could not but feel complimented by this indication that my superiors thought me capable of doing well so many things at once, nor yet could I fail to see that, after all, my care of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> had not been considered of so vital importance, since it would not interfere with the all-important revision of the army regulations, and the retrial of <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03574" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hammond,,,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03575" reg="nearbymention:Hammond,William,A.,,"><surname>Hammond</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4500"/>But I had given my consent, though under erroneous impressions as to the reasons and necessity, to what my superiors desired, and hence determined to keep my thoughts to myself so long as the promises made by <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03576" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> were fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4501"/>But I had hardly got settled in the academic chair before I received a great affront from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, through the adjutantgeneral of the army, in direct violation of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00443.03577" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.444" n="444"/> promise that I should <q direct="unspecified">be subject to no supervision except by the usual <orgName n="Visitors Board" type="board">board of visitors</orgName> and the general commanding the army.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4502"/>This offensive action arose not simply from ignorance of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00444.03578" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s promise, of which the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs> and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> had evidently not been informed, but from culpable ignorance of the academic regulations on the part of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>, and still more culpable disregard of the invariable rule of courtesy enjoined by military law among military men. With no little difficulty I restrained my indignation so far as to write a calm and respectful letter to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, inclosing a copy of my correspondence with <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00444.03579" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> respecting my command at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, and pointing out the regulation which he or the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs> had ignored, and requesting him to submit the whole matter to the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4503"/>It is due to the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary">Honorable Secretary</rs>, and is a pleasure to me, to say that he did not wait the slow course of the mail, but telegraphed me at once that it was all a mistake, and that he made all the amend that a gentleman could make under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4504"/>He as well as I had been made the victim of the ignorance and discourtesy of a staff officer, in a matter about which the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> could of necessity know nothing unless the staff officer informed him. But I was determined to guard against any such outrage in future, and hence insisted that <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> be erected into a military department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4505"/>By this means I would become entitled to the effective intervention and protection of the general of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4506"/>This is the origin of that anomaly which must have puzzled many military men, namely, the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="Department of the West" type="department">Department of West</orgName> Point.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4507"/></p> 
<p>But I discovered in time that even this safeguard was by no means sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4508"/>I had some apprehension on this subject at the start, and telegraphed <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00444.03580" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> <pb id="p.445" n="445"/> about it; but his answer of <dateStruct value="-05-25"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="25">25</day></dateStruct> was accepted as sufficiently reassuring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4509"/>Indeed it could hardly have been imagined that a President of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would disregard an honorable obligation incurred by his predecessor; but before I got through with that matter I was enlightened on that point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4510"/>In the spring of <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct> there arose great public excitement over the case of the <num value="1">one</num> colored cadet then at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4511"/>This cadet, whose name was <persName n="Whittaker,,,,," id="n0131.0024.00445.03581" reg="mostcommon:Whittaker,nomatch:0"><surname>Whittaker</surname></persName>, had twice been found deficient in studies, and recommended by the academic board for dismissal; but had been saved therefrom by me, in my perhaps too strong desire to give the young colored man all possible chance of ultimate success, however unwise his appointment to the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName> might have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4512"/>As was stated by me at the time, in my report of the case to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, that <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and unusual indulgence was based upon the fact that he was the only representative of his race then at the academy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4513"/>Being again, for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time, in danger of dismissal, that colored cadet, either by his own hands, or by others with his consent (of which he was finally convicted by a <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">general court</orgName>-martial), was bound hand and foot and mutilated in such manner as, while doing him no material injury, to create a suspicion of foul play on the part of other cadets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4514"/>An official investigation by the commandant, <persName n="Lazelle,Colonel,Henry,M.,," id="n0131.0024.00445.03582" reg="default:Lazelle,Henry,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Lazelle</surname></persName>, led him to the conclusion that the other cadets had no knowledge whatever of the outrage, and that the colored cadet himself was guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4515"/>Not being fully satisfied with that conclusion, I appointed a <orgName n="Inquiry Court" type="court">court of inquiry</orgName> to investigate the matter more thoroughly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4516"/>The result of that investigation fully sustained the finding of <persName n="Lazelle,Colonel,,,," id="n0131.0024.00445.03583" reg="nearbymention:Lazelle,Henry,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lazelle</surname></persName>, that the colored cadet himself was the guilty person.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4517"/>But those judicial conclusions did not suffice to allay the public clamor for protection to the recently emancipated <pb id="p.446" n="446"/> negroes in the enjoyment of privileges in the national institutions for which they had not become either mentally or morally fitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4518"/>A presidential election was pending, and the colored vote and that in sympathy with it demanded assurance of the hearty and effective support of the national administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4519"/>Nothing less than a radical change at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> would satisfy that demand, and who could be a more appropriate victim to offer as a sacrifice to that Moloch than <num value="1">one</num> who had already gone beyond the limits of duty, of justice, and of wisdom in his kind treatment of the colored cadet?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4520"/>It was decided in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> that he, the over-kind superintendent himself, should be sacrificed to that partizan clamor before the coming election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4521"/>Some rumor of this purpose had reached me, though it had been concealed from <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00446.03584" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who assured me that no such purpose existed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>In <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00446.03585" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s absence, <persName n="Terry,General,Alfred,H.,," id="n0131.0024.00446.03586" reg="default:Terry,Alfred,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Alfred</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Terry</surname></persName> was chosen to succeed me. He came to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, <dateStruct value="-08-14"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="14">14</day></dateStruct>, for the purpose of learning from me in person the truth as to the assertion made to him that the proposition to relieve me from duty at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> was in accord with my own wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/>When informed, as he had suspected, that I could not possibly have expressed any such wish under the circumstances then existing, he positively refused, like the honorable man that he was, to be made a party to any such act of wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4524"/>There was not the slightest foundation in fact for the assumption that my relief from command could be based upon my own request, and no such reason could have been given in an order relieving me. That assumption could have had no other apparent motive than to induce my warm friend <persName n="Terry,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00446.03587" reg="nearbymention:Terry,Alfred,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Terry</surname></persName> to accept the appointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4525"/>As soon as he learned the truth from me, <persName n="Terry,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00446.03588" reg="nearbymention:Terry,Alfred,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Terry</surname></persName> went to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and exposed the falsehood of which he and I together were the intended victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4526"/>This <pb id="p.447" n="447"/> action of a true friend, and the correspondence which had passed between <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00447.03589" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and me, sufficed to prevent the consummation of the wrong which had been contemplated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4527"/>After the presidential election was over, and partizan passion had subsided, I made a formal application, <dateStruct value="1880-11-12"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="12">12</day>, <year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, to be relieved from duty at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> on or before the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> following, and to be permitted to await orders until an appropriate command became vacant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>I repeatedly expressed my desire that none of my brother officers should be disturbed in their commands on my account, and that no new command should be created for me. I was entirely content to await the ordinary course of events, in view of pending legislation relative to retirements for age, and of retirements which might be made under the laws then existing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>My relief from <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> was effected earlier than <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00447.03590" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> or I had anticipated.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>my dear General: I have received your confidential letter of yesterday, informing me of the bungling scheme which has been worked out without your help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>I presume it would be fruitless to attempt any opposition to the species of mania which manifests itself in such action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4541"/>It may be best to let it run its course during the short time which must yet elapse until a reign of reason is again inaugurated with the incoming administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>But it occurs to me that you may be able to save the useless expense to the government and the great inconvenience and expense to staff officers which would necessarily result from the organization of a division which could only last for a few months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>To me personally it is a matter of little moment; but not so with the staff officers and the military appropriations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4544"/>I am not willing to have such a thing done, even apparently, on my account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/>Please advise what official action, if any, should be taken by me in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4546"/>Personally I am perfectly ready to obey the <rs>President</rs>'s order, without a word of protest; but I am not willing to be the occasion of manifest injury to the public service, and of useless inconvenience and expense to the officers of the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> who must be assigned to the headquarters of the new division.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4547"/>Very truly yours, </p><closer><signed><persName n="Schofield,,J.,M.,," id="n0131.0024.00448.03596" reg="expanded:Schofield,John,M.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName>  <surname>Schofield</surname></persName>.</signed></closer></body></text></p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4548"/>But the public interests, and my desire to make my own entirely subservient thereto, were alike disregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4549"/>A new division was carved out of the <num value="3">three</num> old ones, in violation of the plainest dictates of military principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4550"/>The government was subjected to a worse than useless expense of many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of dollars, and a number of staff officers to like useless expense and trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4551"/>For all this there was no other apparent motive but to make it appear that there were appropriate commands for all the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major-generals</rs> then in active service, and hence no reason for placing any <num value="1">one</num> of them on the retired list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4552"/>As a part of that scheme, <num value="1">one</num> of the most active brigadier-generals, younger than <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major-generals</rs>, was selected instead <pb id="p.449" n="449"/> of the latter to make way for an aspirant having greater <q direct="unspecified">influence.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4553"/>The correspondence of that period shows the indignation felt in the army at such disregard of the just claims of officers and of the interests of the military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4554"/>Neither <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00449.03597" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> nor any of the several higher officers at that time could hope to derive any advantage from the passage of the act of Congress, then pending, to retire all officers at a fixed age. On the contrary, such a law would most probably cut them off when in the full prime of activity and usefulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>But all were more than willing to accept that rather than still be in a position to be arbitrarily cut off to make place for some over-ambitious aspirant possessed of greater influence, of whatever kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/>I know perfectly well that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00449.03598" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> was governed by a generous desire to give <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00449.03599" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> command of the army for a number of years, while the latter was still in the prime of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>But that he could have done, and had announced his intention to do, by requesting to be relieved from the command and permitted to await the <rs>President</rs>'s orders, performing such duties, from time to time, as the <rs>President</rs> might desire of him. Such a status of high officers of great experience, whose inspections, observations, and advice might be of great value to the <rs>President</rs> and to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, would manifestly have been far better for the country than that of total retirement, which deprives the <rs>President</rs> of any right to call upon them for any service whatever, even in an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> of the subjects of correspondence between <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0024.00449.03600" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and me while I was in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">2</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/>But it was finally agreed by all concerned that it would be best to favor the uniform application of the rule of retirement for age, so that all might be assured, as far as possible, of a time, to which they might look forward with certainty, when they would be relieved from further apprehension of treatment which <pb id="p.450" n="450"/> no soldier can justly characterize without apparent disrespect to his official superior.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>Such treatment is indeed uncommon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4561"/>The conduct of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the army toward his subordinates has been generally kind and considerate in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/>But the few opposite examples have been quite enough to cloud the life of every officer of high rank with the constant apprehension of an insult which he could neither submit to nor resent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>Soon after the inauguration of <persName n="Garfield,President,,,," id="n0131.0024.00450.03601" reg="mostcommon:Garfield,James,Abram,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Garfield</surname></persName>, the <q direct="unspecified">Division of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs></q> was broken up, and I was permitted to visit <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, as I had requested in the preceding <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, until the <rs>President</rs> should be pleased to assign me to a command according to my rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4581"/>The next day the corps was reviewed in the streets of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4583"/>The head of <pb id="p.452" n="452"/> the cavalcade, consisting of the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>American</rs> generals, and a few other officers of high rank, came out in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>This view of the issue was fully accepted by <persName n="Porter,General,,,," id="n0131.0025.00461.03641" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> and his counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>This caused a new and peculiar duty to devolve upon the board&mdash;at least it was so to me; that is, to find, if possible, some view of all the evidence, or of all the facts established by the evidence, that could be regarded as consistent with the theory or supposition that <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00461.03642" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> was guilty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>When the evidence was all in, the members of the board separated for several weeks to let each examine all the evidence and reach his own conclusion, to be presented in form at the next meeting of the board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/>I believe I devoted more earnest work to the examination <pb id="p.462" n="462"/> and analysis than I had ever done to any <num value="1">one</num> thing before in my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>I tried in succession every possible combination of the established facts, in the effort to find some <num value="1">one</num> consistent with the theory that <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00462.03643" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> had been guilty of disobedience, as charged, or of any other military offense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>But I could not find <num value="1">one</num>, except the very patent <num value="1">one</num> that he had sent despatches to <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00462.03644" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> which were by no means respectful to <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00462.03645" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>; and the board expressed an opinion in condemnation of that, which <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00462.03646" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s counsel very frankly admitted to be just.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>In the course of that long and earnest effort to find <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00462.03647" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> guilty,&mdash;for that is what the effort was in effect,&mdash; the whole story of his conduct and of the operations of the <num value="2">two</num> opposing armies and the actions of other prominent officers became so clear, and his honorable and soldierly conduct so absolutely demonstrated, that it was exceedingly difficult, in view of all the wrong he had suffered, to write a cold judicial statement of the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> draft was toned down in many particulars in the effort to bring it within the strictest rules of judicial decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>I have sometimes thought since that if the report of the board could have been much colder, it might have been better at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00462.03648" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>, though less just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>But I do not think he or any of his companions and friends will ever feel like finding fault because the board could not entirely suppress the feelings produced by their discovery of the magnitude of the wrong that had been done to a gallant fellow-soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I met <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0025.00462.03649" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> after the decision of the board was published was very soon after he had published in <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct> the result of his own investigation of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>He at once introduced the subject, and talked about it for a long time in the most earnest manner that I ever heard him speak on any subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>He would not permit me to utter a single sentence until he had gone all over the case and showed me that he understood all <pb id="p.463" n="463"/> its essential features as thoroughly as I did, and that his judgment was precisely the same as that which the board had reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>He intimated very decidedly that no impartial and intelligent military man could, in his opinion, possibly reach any other conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>The general evidently desired to make it perfectly clear that he had not adopted the opinion of the board of which I was a member, nor that of any <num value="1">one</num> else; but that he had thoroughly mastered the case for himself, and formed his own judgment in regard to it. I take pleasure in recording the fact that he unquestionably had (lone it, and I never knew a man who could form more positive opinions, or <num value="1">one</num> who could express them more convincingly, than <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0025.00463.03650" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>The board was not called upon to express any opinion respecting the action of the court-martial upon the evidence before it, and it would have been manifestly improper to do so. Speaking for myself, and not for any other member of the board, I do not now hesitate to say that the finding and sentence of the general courtmar-tial which tried <persName n="Porter,General,Fitz-John,,," id="n0131.0025.00463.03651" reg="default:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Fitz-John</foreName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> were not justified by the evidence before that court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>In my judgment, formed from long observation and much experience, the passions of war often render the administration of justice impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>A suggestion once made to me by a man in very high military authority, that a finding and sentence of court-martial rendered in time of war should be regarded as <hi rend="italics">res adjudicata</hi>, produced in my mind the painful impression that a very great man did not find the word <q direct="unspecified">justice</q> anywhere in his vocabulary; and I watched for many years the conversation and writings and public speeches of that man without finding that he ever made use of that word, or ever gave as a reason for doing or not doing anything that it would be just or unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/>In his mind, whatever might have happened to any person was simply a matter of good or bad fortune which did <pb id="p.464" n="464"/> not concern him. He refused even to consider the question whether injustice had or had not been done, or whether the operation of a law was not relatively unjust to some as compared to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>When to such natural character and habits of thought are added the stern necessities of war as viewed by a commander and many other officers, what possible chance of justice can be left to an <hi rend="italics">unfortunate</hi> man?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>It is true that even if the life of an innocent man may have been sacrificed under the stern necessities of discipline, that is no more than <num value="1000">thousands</num> of his fellow-soldiers have suffered because of the crimes and follies of politicians who brought on the war. But that is no reason why his memory as well as those of his comrades should not be finally honored, if it can be proved that, after all, he also was innocent and brave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>In my opinion, no government can be regarded as just to its army unless it provides, under appropriate conditions, for the rehearing of cases that may be tried by court-martial in time of war. Perhaps it may most wisely be left for the <rs>President</rs> and Congress to institute appropriate action in each individual case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>That is a matter for mature consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>My only desire is to suggest the necessity for some such action, whenever reasonable grounds for it may be presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>I have no respect for the suggestions sometimes urged that labor and expense are sufficient grounds for failure to secure justice to every citizen or soldier of the republic, whether at home or abroad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>Soon after <persName n="Logan,General,,,," id="n0131.0025.00464.03652" reg="mostcommon:Logan,John,A.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Logan</surname></persName>'s last election to the <name>Senate</name>, I had a very interesting and unreserved conversation with him, at his house in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 18" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, in respect to his action in the <rs>Porter</rs> case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>He spoke of it with evident candor, acknowledged that his view of the case was probably wrong, and as if to excuse his mistake, volunteered an explanation as to how he came to take that view of it. <pb id="p.465" n="465"/> He told me that when he found that the case might probably come before Congress, he wanted to prepare himself in advance as far as possible to deal with it justly, and to defend the right effectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>Hence he went to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0025.00465.03653" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to obtain the best possible view of the military questions involved.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>At that time neither <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0025.00465.03658" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> nor <persName n="Logan,General,,,," id="n0131.0025.00465.03659" reg="mostcommon:Logan,John,A.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Logan</surname></persName> knew anything of the new evidence which was afterward submitted to the board of review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>In reply to my statement that he had unquestionably been led astray, he said that that was quite probable, but that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00465.03661" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was responsible, and it was then too late to change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>I do not think that anybody will now hesitate to say that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0025.00465.03662" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s view of his duty in respect to this last point was the more to be commended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>But the fact I wish to record is that of <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00465.03663" reg="mostcommon:Logan,John,A.,,:3"><surname>Logan</surname></persName>'s sincerity in the great efforts he had made to convict <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0131.0025.00465.03664" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> on the floor of the <name>Senate</name>, and his explanation of the way in which he had been led into the greatest possible error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4707"/>It suggests the reflection that even a senator of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> might better form his own opinions rather than adopt those even of the highest authority, when the only question involved is <num value="1">one</num> of justice, and not <num value="1">one</num> of public policy, in which latter case differences of opinion must of necessity <pb id="p.466" n="466"/> be reconciled for the purpose of securing unity of action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>As an illustration of the necessity for an absolutely impartial review of cases which have involved the passions of war, reference must be made to the action of <num value="1">one</num> member of the <rs type="place">Porter court</rs>-martial who made it generally understood that his individual opinion supported the finding of that court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>He went so far as to make inquiries whether precedents could be found in American or <name>English</name> history to sustain a member of a court-martial in publicly defending the finding of that court, notwithstanding the oath of secrecy imposed by law upon every member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>And this same member of the court was furnished by a very able lawyer with an argument in support of the findings of the court, based upon a review of the evidence submitted to the subsequent board, as if that member of the court might make public use of that argument as his own. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> had known little of me either officially or personally, and I had had some grave differences with the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> upon subjects of great importance in my estimation, though doubtless less in his. I had defended as well as I could, and with some persistence, what I then believed and now know was the right, but had been worsted, as a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>It is due to the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary">Honorable Secretary</rs> to say that he disclaimed, many months later, ever having knowingly given his sanction to the document announcing <num value="1">one</num> of the military doctrines which I had so persistently but ineffectually combated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/>But I did not know that in <dateStruct value="1888-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct>, and he did not then know that he had been thus betrayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>Hence I thought it quite improbable that a general holding opinions so radically opposed to those of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> would be called to the command of the army.

It is not my purpose to go into the history of that long controversy, but only to state briefly its final result, part of which was perhaps due to <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0131.0026.00468.03671" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s extreme illness for some time before his death, and his retention <pb id="p.469" n="469"/> in nominal command and in the nominal administration of military justice long after it had become impossible for him to discharge such duties intelligently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>But that result had been practically reached a long time before <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0131.0026.00469.03672" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> became seriously ill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4728"/>I have always understood, but do not know the fact, that in former times the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> had exercised some intelligent control over military affairs, so that there was at least unity in the exercise of military authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/>But in <dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct> even that had ceased, and it had been boldly announced some time before that each departmental chief of staff, in his own sphere, was clothed with all the authority of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4730"/>All that a major-general as well as an officer of lower grade had to do was to execute such orders as he might receive from the brigadiers at the head of the several bureaus in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4731"/>It was not even necessary for those mighty chiefs to say that their mandates had the sanction of any higher authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4733"/>It is not strange that the <rs>Secretary</rs> was finally unable to admit that he, great lawyer as he was, could possibly have given his sanction to such an interpretation of the law as that; but the decision was given by his order, and it governed the army for a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4734"/>Of course the adjutant-general became by far the chiefest of those many chiefs; for it is his function to issue to the army all the orders of both the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> and the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4735"/>Be it said to his credit <pb id="p.470" n="470"/> that he did not assume to issue any orders in his own name, after the manner of the other chiefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4736"/>Like a sensible man, he was content with the actual exercise of power, without caring to let the army know that he did it. He had only to use the name of the <rs>Secretary</rs> or the general, as he pleased; either would answer with the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4737"/>Of course I knew something of this before I went to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, for the evidence of it was sometimes too plain to be ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4738"/>Yet it did seem to me passing strange to sit in my office about noon, where I had been all the day before, and learn from the New York papers what orders I had issued on that previous day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4739"/>Upon inquiry I was told that that was only a matter of routine, and a rule of long standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4740"/>But I mildly indicated that such a practice did not meet my approval, and that I wished it changed, which was finally done, as explained in a previous chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4741"/>But even then I had no means of knowing whether an order sent to me in the name of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> had ever been seen by him, or whether it was the work of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>, or the product of some joint operation of <num value="2">two</num> or more of the several chiefs, each of whom had the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s authority to do such things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4742"/>At length the <rs>Secretary</rs>, though with evidently serious misgivings respecting some deep ulterior purpose of mine, consented that I might have an officer of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>'s department, whom I knew, in my own office, to keep me informed of what I was to do, and, if possible, what orders I might actually receive from the <rs>Secretary</rs> himself, and what from the several other heads of that hydra called the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4743"/>After that change things went on much better; but it was at best only an armed truce, with everybody on guard, until the end of that administration, and then it came very near culminating in a pitched battle at the very beginning of the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4744"/>By what seemed at the time <pb id="p.471" n="471"/> a very sharp trick, but which may possibly have been only the natural working of the vicious system, I was made to appear to the new <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> as having failed promptly to give effect to an order authorized by his predecessor, but on which no authentic marks of <hi rend="italics">his</hi> authority appeared, only such as might indicate that it came from another source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4745"/>But if it was a trick, it signally failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4746"/>A few candid words from <num value="1">one</num> soldier to another, even if that other had not been a soldier all his life, were quite sufficient to dissipate that little cloud which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> had threatened a storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4747"/>Then sunlight began to appear; and when, in due time, by the operation of some natural laws, and some others happily enacted by Congress, certain necessary changes came about, the sky over the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> became almost cloudless, and I trust it may never again be darkened as it had been nearly all the time for <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4750"/>Thus the <rs>Secretary</rs> found the chief of <num value="1">one</num> of the bureaus of his department gone without his authority, he knew not where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4751"/>It was not difficult for the <rs>Secretary</rs> to point out to the general, as he did in writing, in a firm, though kind and confidential way, that such could not possibly be the true meaning of the <rs>President</rs>'s order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4752"/>No attempt appears to have been made to discuss the subject further, or to find any <pb id="p.472" n="472"/> ground broad enough for both <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> and general to stand upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4753"/>Nothing further appears to have been said or done on that subject during that administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4754"/>But upon the inauguration of the next, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> sent out to all the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding generals</rs> of the army copies of that letter of his predecessor, in which the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> had been so mildly and respectfully, yet so thoroughly, beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4755"/>The army was thus given to understand that on that occasion their senior in command had not even been given a chance to <q direct="unspecified">throw up the sponge,</q> as his predecessor had done, but had been <q direct="unspecified">knocked out</q> by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4756"/>As if that was not humiliation enough for a great soldier to bear, whenever the <rs>Secretary</rs> went away <num value="1">one</num> of the same chiefs of bureaus that the general thought he had a right to command acted as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, to dominate over him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4757"/>But the loyal, subordinate soldier who had commanded great armies and achieved magnificent victories in the field while those bureau chiefs were purveying powder and balls, or pork and beans, submitted even to that without a murmur, for a great lawyer had told him such was the law, and how could he know any better?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4758"/>It was only when the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>, his own staff-officer, so made by the regulations which the general knew, was thus appointed over him, that his soldierly spirit rebelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4759"/>The humblest soldier of a republic could not endure that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4760"/>All this was based upon the theory that the general of the army was not an officer of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and hence could not be appointed acting <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> of War.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4761"/>Surely the little army had a hard time while it was thus turned out into the cold, not even its chief recognized as belonging to any department of the government of the country which they were all sworn to <pb id="p.473" n="473"/> serve, but subject to the orders of any bureau officer who happened to be the senior in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> in hot summer weather, when nearly all had gone to the mountains or the sea!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4768"/>There was great rejoicing throughout the little army when it was again recognized as belonging to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">Department of War</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4769"/>But that cause of rejoicing was soon beclouded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/>By another of those inscrutable dispensations of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, another superior, under the title of <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>, was interposed between the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the army and the general appointed to assist him in the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4771"/>It had been thought, and so stated in writing, that the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major-general</rs> commanding, and the <num value="10">ten</num> heads of staff departments and bureaus, with their many assistants, all educated men of long experience in the several departments of military affairs, and some of them tried in war, might give the <rs>Secretary</rs> all the assistance he needed, if they were permitted to do it. But no; it appears to have been thought that some other, who had had no education or experience in the affairs of the <rs>War</rs> <pb id="p.474" n="474"/> Department, could better assist a Secretary who to similar acquired qualifications for his office added far greater natural endowments and the just confidence of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/>Thus the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major-general</rs> was treated as much worse than the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">lieutenant-general</rs> had been, as he was inferior to him in rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4773"/>But I also submitted without a word, because it was this time unquestionably the law as well as the will of my lawful superiors in office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4774"/>I waited as patiently as I could, as the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">lieutenant-general</rs> had done, the time when by operation of law, human or divine, welcome relief from a burdensome duty would come, upon the official declaration that I had done, as best I could, all the duty that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and my country required of me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4775"/><num value="1">One</num> illustration will suffice to show the working of this new invention by which the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> was still further removed from the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>, whose chief military adviser he was supposed to be. An act of Congress authorized the <rs>President</rs> to confer medals of honor upon soldiers of all grades who might be most distinguished for bravery in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4776"/>It is the most highly prized of all military rewards because given to the <hi rend="italics">soldier</hi>, without regard to rank, for that service which every true soldier regards as of the greatest merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4777"/>The standard of merit deserving that reward is essentially the same in all the armies of the civilized world, and the medal is made of iron or bronze, instead of anything more glittering or precious, to indicate the character of the deed it commemorates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4778"/>That standard of merit is the most heroic devotion in the discharge of <hi rend="italics">soldierly duty</hi> in the face of the enemy, that conduct which brings victory, honor, and glory to the country for which a brave man has devoted his life in obedience to the orders which have come down to him from the head of the nation, which spirit of obedience and devotion creates armies and saves nations from defeat, disaster, or domestic convulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4779"/>These highest tokens of a nation's honor had for many years <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> been given with the greatest care, after most rigid scrutiny of the official records and all other evidence presented, laboriously reviewed by the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> in person, recommended by him under the universal rule of civilized nations, and approved by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, whose approval is considered equivalent to the order of the <rs>President</rs>, by which alone, under the law, a medal of honor can be granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4780"/>But at length these carefully considered recommendations were disapproved by the <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>, on the ground that the soldier had only done his duty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4781"/>He had only done, or heroically tried to do until stricken down by the enemy's fire, what his commander had ordered!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4782"/>Some other standard of soldierly honor was set up, not involving obedience to orders nor discharge of duty, but instead of that some act of each soldier's own volition, as if what a nation most highly honored was independent action of each <num value="1">one</num> of its <num value="1000000">million</num> of soldiers, without any special regard to the orders of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> or any of his subordinate commanders!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4783"/>Thus the most dearly bought honor of a citizen of this great republic, intrusted by Congress to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the army, to be duly awarded to his subordinates, passed into the hands of an <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>, to be awarded by him under his own newly invented theory of soldierly merit!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4784"/>After a laborious but vain attempt to obtain recognition of the time-honored standard of soldierly honor and merit, the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> was forced to admit that the new standard set up by the <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs> did not afford him any intelligible guide by which he could be governed in making his recommendations, and hence he requested to be relieved <hi rend="italics">by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs></hi> from consideration of such cases in future, presuming that the vital question would thus, as a matter of course, receive the <hi rend="italics">personal</hi> consideration of the <rs>Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4785"/>The formal action of the <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>,</q> relieving the <pb id="p.476" n="476"/> general from that important duty involving the honor of those under his command, was very promptly made known to him. But now there is very good reason for the belief that the honorable and very worthy <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> knew nothing at all of the whole transaction!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4786"/>It was my good fortune to have had, by close personal association, exact knowledge of the difficulties which my predecessors had encountered, as well as, perhaps, a more modest ambition, and hence to avoid some of those difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4787"/>Yet in view of the past experience of all commanders of the army, from that of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n0131.0026.00476.03682" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> with the <orgName n="Continental Congress" type="congress">Continental Congress</orgName> down to the present time, I advise all my young brother soldiers to limit their ambition to the command of the <orgName n="Division of the Atlantic" type="division">Division of the Atlantic</orgName> or <orgName n="Department of the East" type="department">Department of the East</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/>But since some of them must in all probability be required to discharge the duties of the higher position, I trust the varied experiences of their predecessors may serve as some help to them in the discharge of those duties, which are vastly more difficult and far less agreeable than any other duties of an American soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4789"/>They are the duties which most closely concern the subordinate relation of the military to the civil power in a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4790"/>In that relation I had the great good fortune to enjoy most cordial and considerate personal treatment on the part of my distinguished associates representing the civil power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>Hence my advice to my young military friends may be fairly regarded as based upon the most favorable view of what any of them may reasonably expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4792"/>It is the <num value="1">one</num> position of all in the army which most severely tries the spirit of subordination which is so indispensable in a soldier of a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4793"/>I have not thought it surprising that none of my great predecessors were quite able to endure the trial.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4794"/>It is there where the polished surfaces of military etiquette and military methods come in contact with the <pb id="p.477" n="477"/> rough cast-iron of those which often prevail in civil administration, and the former get badly scratched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4795"/>Military rules are invariable, with rare exceptions understood and observed by all, while civil practice varies according to the character and habits of the chief in authority, from those of the illustrious <rs>Stanton</rs>, now well known in history,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/>Long observation and experience have led to the belief that such rasping of feelings, too sensitive perhaps, even more than substantial difference, has often been the cause of discord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4799"/>A single example may suffice to illustrate what is meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4800"/>In the arrangements of the room especially designed for the <orgName>office of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs></orgName> in the splendid new State, War, and <placeName reg="Navy Departments building">Navy Departments building</placeName>, was a great table-desk on which was a complete system of electric buttons connected with wires leading to bells in all the principal offices in the department, the buttons bearing the titles of the officers at the head of the several bureaus, etc., so that the <rs>Secretary</rs> could <q direct="unspecified">ring up</q> any colonel, <rs type="role" n="Brigadier-General">brigadier-general</rs>, or majorgen-eral whom he wanted to see, just as a gentleman in private life does his coachman, butler, or valet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4801"/>To an army officer who had for many years, in lower grades, been accustomed to the invariable formula, delivered by a well-dressed soldier standing at <q direct="unspecified">attention</q> and respectfully saluting, <q direct="unspecified">The commanding officer sends his compliments to <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> B&mdash;, and wishes to see the captain at headquarters,</q> the tinkling of that soft little bell must have sounded harsh indeed after he had attained the rank of brigadier-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4802"/>Twice only, I believe, my own old soldier messenger who attended in the room where the telephone and bells were located, came to my room, with an indescribable expression on his face, and said, <q direct="unspecified">The bell from the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s office is ringing!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4803"/>I replied, <q direct="unspecified">Indeed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4804"/>Go up and inquire what it means.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4805"/>Presently the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s <pb id="p.478" n="478"/> own messenger appeared, and delivered a message in courteous terms&mdash;whether the same the <rs>Secretary</rs> had given to him I did not know, but had reason to doubt, for I had seen and heard the <rs>Secretary</rs> violently ring a certain bell several times, and then say with great emphasis to his messenger, <q direct="unspecified">Go and tell M&mdash;to come here,</q> not even using the high military title by which <q direct="unspecified">M&mdash;</q> was habitually addressed in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4806"/>But those uncivil methods of an imperfect civilization are gradually passing away, and the more refined courtesies, taught, I believe, in all our great schools as well as in the military and naval service, are taking their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4808"/>Thus it appeared, when I went into the office in <dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct>, that of my predecessors in command of the army, <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00478.03684" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00478.03685" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had given up the contest, <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00478.03686" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> had been quickly put <hi rend="italics">hors de combat</hi>, while <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00478.03687" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> alone had won the fight, and that after a long contest, involving several issues, in which a <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> was finally removed from office with the consent of his own personal and political friends, a President was impeached and escaped removal from office by only <num value="1">one</num> vote, and the country was brought to the verge of another civil war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4809"/>Be that as it might, I had no desire to try again what so many others had failed to accomplish, but thought it better to make an experiment with a less ambitious plan of my own, which I had worked out while trying to champion the ideas entertained by all my predecessors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4810"/>At the request of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0026.00478.03692" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0026.00478.03693" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, when the <num value="1">one</num> was <pb id="p.479" n="479"/> <rs type="role2">President</rs> and the other general of the army, I studied the subject as thoroughly as I was capable of doing, and formulated a regulation intended to define the relations between the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, the general of the army, and the staff departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4811"/>I still think that plan of my great superiors, only formulated by me, would have worked quite satisfactorily if it could have had general and cordial support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4812"/>Yet I do not think it was based upon the soundest view of the constitutional obligations of the <rs>President</rs> as commander-in-chief of the army, nor at all consistent with the practice in this country of giving the command of the army to the officer happening to be senior in rank, without regard to the <q direct="unspecified">special trust and confidence</q> reposed in him by the <rs>President</rs> for the time being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4813"/>It was based too much upon the special conditions then existing, wherein the general of the army, no less than the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, enjoyed the confidence of the <rs>President</rs> in the highest degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4814"/>The plan proposed to give far too great authority to the general, if he did not, for whatever reason, enjoy the full confidence of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4815"/>It also trusted too much to the ability and disinterested fidelity of the several chiefs of the staff departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4816"/>In short, it was based upon a supposed higher degree of administrative virtue than always exists even in this country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4817"/>However all this may be, the proposed regulation did not meet with cordial support, so far as I know, from any but <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0026.00479.03694" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0026.00479.03695" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Meigs,General,M.,C.,," id="n0131.0026.00479.03696" reg="default:Meigs,M.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Meigs</surname></persName>, then quartermaster-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4818"/>The other bureau chiefs earnestly opposed it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4819"/>The personal controversy between <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0131.0026.00479.03698" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> many years before had resulted in the repeal, through revision, of the old and quite satisfactory regulation <pb id="p.480" n="480"/> on the subject, and no other worthy of the name has ever been adopted in its place.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4820"/>Soon after I was assigned to the command of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> I submitted, in writing, to <persName n="Cleveland,President,,,," id="n0131.0026.00480.03699" reg="nearbymention:Cleveland,Grover,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName> my own mature views on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4821"/>They received some favorable consideration, but no formal action, in view of the near approach of the end of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4822"/>From that time till near the present the paper was in the personal custody of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4823"/>What consideration, if any, it ever received, I was never informed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4824"/>But it was the guide of my own action, at least, while I was in command of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4825"/>It is now on file in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4826"/>It is to be hoped that some future military and administrative geniuses, superior to any of the last <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, may be able to solve that difficult problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4827"/>I can only say that my own plan worked well enough so long as I helped to work it. How it may be with anybody else, either under my plan or some other, only the future can determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4828"/>I so far succeeded that the most intelligent staff officers used to say, <q direct="unspecified">For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the general actually does command the army.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4829"/>They saw only the results, without exactly perceiving the nature of the motive-power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4830"/>The way to success in rendering efficient public service does not lie through any assumption of the authority which the nation may have given to another, even if not most wisely, but rather in zealous, faithful, and subordinate efforts to assist that other in doing what the country has imposed upon him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4831"/>A soldier may honorably crave, as the dearest object of his life, recognition of his <hi rend="italics">past services</hi> by promotion to a higher grade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4832"/>That is his <num value="1">one</num> reward for all he may have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4833"/>But the desire for higher command, greater power, and more unrestrained authority exhibits ambition inconsistent with due military subordination and good citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4834"/>It is a dangerous ambition in a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4835"/><pb id="p.481" n="481"/> The highest examples of patriotism ever shown in this country have been in the voluntary surrender of power into the hands of the people or of their chosen representatives, not in efforts to increase or prolong that power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4836"/>Following those highest examples, in the year <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct> all the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officers</rs> of the army, including <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00481.03700" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00481.03701" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00481.03702" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, united in advocating the measure then pending in Congress, to fix a limit of age when every officer should relinquish command and return to the ranks of private citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>In doing so, nearly all of those seniors, especially <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00481.03703" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, relinquished forever all hope of rising to the command of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4838"/>My case was not so strong as that of <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00481.03704" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, because I was younger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/>But <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00481.03705" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> was only <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> older than I, and his <q direct="unspecified">expectation of life</q> was far beyond the time when I should become <measure n="64years" type="date">sixty-four years</measure> old. Hence I cheerfully relinquished in <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct> any reasonable ambition I may ever have had to command the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/>My ultimate succession to that command in <dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct> was, like all other important events in my personal career, unsought and unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/>Hence whatever I did from <dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1895--"><year reg="1895">1895</year></dateStruct> was only a little <q direct="unspecified">extra duty,</q> and I have had no reason to find fault on account of the <q direct="unspecified">extra-duty pay</q> which I received, though none of it was in money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>I am inclined to think it a pretty good rule for a soldier to wait until he is <q direct="unspecified">detailed,</q> and not to try to put himself <q direct="unspecified">on guard.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>I do not know any case in American history where the opposite course has not resulted in irretrievable injury to him who adopted it. Temporary success in gaining high position, before education and experience have given the necessary qualifications, necessarily results finally in failure; while slower advancement, giving full opportunities for education and experience in the duties of each grade, insures full qualification for the next higher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4844"/>American history is full of such examples, as it is&mdash;alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4845"/>too truly&mdash;of those cases where the highest qualifications <pb id="p.482" n="482"/> and most becoming modesty have not met with any appropriate advancement or other recognition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4846"/>In the official intercourse of a soldier with the great departments of government, he often finds useful those maxims which have served him as commander of an army in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>The most important of these is, not to enter a combat where he is sure to be beaten, as, for instance, where his opponent is the judge who is to decide the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4848"/>As in war, so in administration, battle once joined, questions of right become obscured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>The most powerful guns and battalions are sure to win. It is much wiser to seek an ally who carries a heavier armament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4850"/>Some subordinates of mine&mdash;clerks and messengers, I believe&mdash;were once required to refund some money which had been paid them on my interpretation of the law and regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>My careful explanation of the ground of my action was promptly disapproved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4852"/>I then requested that the money be charged to me and the whole matter referred to Congress, in reply to which request I was informed that the accounts had been settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4853"/>In another case I requested that my appeal from adverse action be submitted to <persName n="Grant,President,,,," id="n0131.0026.00482.03706" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, who had had occasion to know something about me. I was requested by telegraph, in cipher, to withdraw that appeal, as it was liable to cause trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>Being a lover of peace rather than war, I complied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4855"/>In that perhaps I made a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>If I had adhered to my appeal, it might have saved a public impeachment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4857"/>Again, I was called upon by <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs type="place">Treasury bureaus</rs> to refund some money which had been paid me for mileage by order of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, on the alleged ground that the <rs>Secretary</rs> could not lawfully give me such an order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4858"/>I referred the matter to the <rs>Secretary</rs>, as <num value="1">one</num> that did not concern me personally, but which involved the dignity of the head of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> as compared with that of a subordinate bureau of another department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>The Treasury official soon notified <pb id="p.483" n="483"/> me that the account had been allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/>To illustrate the application of the same principle under opposite conditions, I must relate the story told of <persName n="Grant,President,,,," id="n0131.0026.00483.03707" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4861"/>When informed by a Treasury officer that he could not find any law to justify what the <rs>President</rs> had desired to be done, he replied, <q direct="unspecified">Then I will see if I can find a Treasury officer who can find that law.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4862"/>Of course no change in the incumbent of that office proved to be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>I have thought in several cases in later years that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0026.00483.03708" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s military method might have been tried to advantage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/><q direct="unspecified">Be ye wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove</q> is the only rule of action I have ever heard of that can steer a soldier clear of trouble with the civil powers of this great republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>Yet he must sometimes, when his honor or the rights of his subordinates are involved, make the fight, though he knows he must be beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/>A soldier must then stand by his guns as long as he can, and it has happened that such a fight, apparently hopeless at the time, has given victory to a future generation. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>even as late as the year <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct>, very high military authority in this country advocated with great earnestness the proposition that our old brick and stone forts, with their smooth-bore guns, could make a successful defense against a modern iron-clad fleet!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>At the same time, and even much later, high naval authority maintained that the <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">United States navy</orgName> should be relied upon for the defense of our many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of miles of sea-coast!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>In view of such counsel, it does not seem strange that Congress, after the old ships had nearly all rotted away, began to give some attention to a new navy, but thought little or nothing of land defenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>The old brick and stone parapets and the cast-iron guns were still there; none of them had become rotten, though the wooden carriages had gone to decay, and the guns were lying on the ground!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>Yet, after a long dream of security, the <rs>Great</rs> <orgName n="National Council" type="council">National Council</orgName> announced the decision that <hi rend="italics">something</hi> ought probably to be done for sea-coast defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>Provision was made by law for a very high board, with the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> presiding, to report to Congress what was required&mdash;a thing which, if Congress had only known it, the <rs type="place">Engineer Bureau</rs> of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> could have reported just <pb id="p.485" n="485"/> as well in far less time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>But at length a very able report was submitted, which inspired the confidence of Congress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>In the meantime there had arisen a condition which can best be expressed as <q direct="unspecified">want of confidence</q> in the chief of the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> of the army on the part of committees of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>From this it resulted that no appropriations were made for several years for any new armament, and hence none for fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>Thus by a trifle were the wheels of a great government blocked for a long time!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>Yet that government still survives!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>Finally, in the year <dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct> an act was passed creating a <orgName n="Ordnance Board" type="board">Board of Ordnance</orgName> and Fortification, of which the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of the army should be president, and appropriating quite a large sum of money to be expended, under the direct supervision of that board, to commence the work of fortification and armament of the sea-coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>After very careful examination and full consideration and discussion, the board adopted the plans prepared by the <name>Bureaus</name> of Engineering and Ordnance, and the work was begun and carried forward substantially the same as if the expenditure of the appropriation had been intrusted to the <num value="2">two</num> bureaus concerned and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>The board did perform, and still continues to perform, a very important and essential duty, and <num value="1">one</num> which cannot be satisfactorily intrusted to any <num value="1">one</num> man, namely, that of deciding the delicate and difficult questions constantly arising in respect to the practical utility and economy of new inventions having reference to works of defense or of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>But these questions had no immediate bearing whatever upon the all-important problem of the day&mdash;to place the sea-coasts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in a satisfactory state of defense according to the best scientific methods then known to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>And that problem had already been solved, in all respects save <num value="1">one</num>, namely, how to get out of Congress the necessary money to do the work!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/><pb id="p.486" n="486"/> Genius will never cease to invent something better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4885"/>If we wait for the best, the next war will be over long before we shall begin to prepare for it. All great military nations had been engaged for many years in elaborate and costly experiments, to develop the best possible means of attack and defense, and our Engineer and Ordnance departments had not failed to profit thereby to the fullest extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>They were ready, without any such costly experiments, to make our defenses as good as any in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>Yet that work of so vital importance must be delayed until American genius could also be assured of a chance, at government expense, of developing something better than anybody else in the world had done!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>An end was finally, in <dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct>, put to that dangerous delay by the device, so happily invented by somebody in Congress, of a <orgName n="Ordnance Board" type="board">Board of Ordnance</orgName> and Fortification.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>The board has also served, and will doubtless continue to serve, another very important purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>It brings together, in close consideration and discussion of all details of the system of national defense, representative officers of the engineers, the ordnance, and the artillery, together with a representative civilian who has become, by service in Congress, far better able than any other member to insure that perfect understanding between the board and the committees of Congress which is essential to harmonious action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>Above all, it has given to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> an opportunity to become perfectly familiar with all the details of the coast defenses, and to exert a legitimate influence in making preparations for war, which must be of vital importance to him and to the country when he has to bear the great responsibility of command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>I used to say that it would not be just to me to deprive me of such opportunities for education, and I doubt not all my successors will share that feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>Thus, what may prove to be of the greatest benefit to <pb id="p.487" n="487"/> the military service has finally come out of that evil of <q direct="unspecified">want of confidence</q> in an ordnance chief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>When in command of the <orgName n="Division of the Atlantic" type="division">Division of the Atlantic</orgName>, in <dateStruct value="1886--"><year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1887--"><year reg="1887">7</year></dateStruct>, I made a careful estimate of the aggregate strength of the war garrisons required for the fortifications and armament recommended by the <name>Endicott</name> board, and of the peace garrisons which would be absolutely required for the care of the new works and for the instruction of the <orgName n="Militia Artillery" type="artillery">militia artillery</orgName> reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>It was found that the addition of <num value="2">two</num> regiments to the present artillery strength of the army would provide the requisite force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>Hence a measure was formulated and submitted to Congress to convert the present <num value="5">five</num> regiments into <num value="7">seven</num>, with some proportionate reduction in the number of officers, intended to promote efficiency and economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4897"/>That measure has appeared to meet with the approval of nearly all concerned, but is still pending in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4898"/>It is probably the most important military measure now awaiting favorable action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4899"/>The measure which accompanies it for the reorganization of the infantry, though not of so pressing necessity, is based upon sound military principles, and ;s worthy of prompt and favorable action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduction of the policy of confining the warlike tribes of Indians upon very restricted reservations necessarily caused great discontent, especially among the young men, who were thus cut off from the sports of the chase and the still greater sport of occasional forays into frontier settlements, which were the only means known in <name>Indian</name> custom by which a young warrior could gain a name and a position of honor in his tribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>Either through too limited appropriations or bad management, or both, the provisions furnished for the support of the <name>Indians</name>, in lieu of those to which they had been accustomed, proved inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>This caused the spirit of discontent to increase and to become general <pb id="p.488" n="488"/> among all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/>The natural result was such a threat of war from the great <placeName key="tgn,7014508" n="1.000 30" reg="sioux city, woodbury, iowa">Sioux</placeName> nation in the winter of <dateStruct value="1890--"><year reg="1890">1890</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1891--"><year reg="1891">91</year></dateStruct> as to necessitate the concentration of quite a large army to meet the danger of a general outbreak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>In the course of military operations, accidents rather than design on either side occasioned some serious collisions between the troops and the <name>Indians</name>, especially at <placeName key="tgn,7017595" n="1.000 2" reg="wounded knee, shannon, south dakota">Wounded Knee</placeName>, resulting in desperate conflict and in much loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>But by very careful management on the part of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> in the field, <persName n="Miles,Major-General,,,," id="n0131.0027.00488.03710" reg="nearbymention:Miles,Nelson,A.,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Miles</surname></persName>, a general conflict was averted, and the <rs>Sioux</rs> made their submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>They had had no general intention to go to war, if they could avoid it without starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>After a large sum of money had been expended by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> in this way, the deficiencies in food were supplied at about the same cost as would, if made in advance, have removed the cause of war. The <rs>Indians</rs> gained their point of getting as much food as they needed, and the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> paid the extra bills, but out of the same public treasury which has so often been bled in that way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>It was quite beyond the power of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> to guard against a recurrence of that greatest danger of Indian wars&mdash;starvation of the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>But long experience and accurate knowledge of <name>Indian</name> character had suggested a method by which the other cause of discontent among the young <name>Indian</name> warriors might be, at least in a great measure, removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>That was by providing a legitimate method by which their irrepressible love of military life and exploits might be largely gratified, and, at the same time, those ambitious young men transferred from the ranks of more or less probable savage enemies to the ranks of friends and practically civilized allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>Fortunately, the strongest trait of the <rs>Indian</rs> character, namely, fidelity to the war chief, lent itself to this project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>Long experience <pb id="p.489" n="489"/> had shown the existence of this <name>Indian</name> trait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>In only <num value="1">one</num> solitary instance had the <rs>Indian</rs> scouts so long employed by the army ever proved unfaithful, though often employed in hostilities against their own tribes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/>Hence, if the ardent young warriors could be induced to enlist for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> in the army, they would, at least for that time, be converted from enemies into allies, even against such of their own tribes as might refuse to enlist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>Of course the army must suffer somewhat, in its effective strength for all purposes, during this experiment; for it is evident that a company or troop of Indians would not be quite as valuable for <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs> as the same number of white men. Yet the transfer of a few <num value="100">hundred</num> of the best <placeName key="tgn,7014508" n="1.000 30" reg="sioux city, woodbury, iowa">Sioux</placeName> warriors from the <rs>Sioux</rs> side to our side would much more than compensate for the loss of the same number of white troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>The result of that experiment seemed to be entirely satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>At all events, there has been no great <name>Indian</name> war, nor any threat of <num value="1">one</num>, since that experiment was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>It has served to tide over the time during which the young men, who had from earliest childhood listened to stories of the <name>Custer</name> massacre and other great <name>Indian</name> achievements, were undergoing transformation from the life and character of savage warriors to those of civilized husbandmen, under the system of allotments in severalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>When the short warlike part of the life of <num value="1">one</num> generation is past, the danger will no longer exist.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>So confident were some officials of the administration that war was inevitable, that I was asked to make an estimate of the military force which would be necessary to occupy and hold a vital <pb id="p.490" n="490"/> point in <placeName reg="Chile,South America" key="tgn,1000049">Chilean territory</placeName> until the demands of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>in <dateStruct value="1894--"><year reg="1894">1894</year></dateStruct> the vast development of railroad communication between the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs> and the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName>, and the similar building of new cities and founding of industrial enterprises in the region between the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs> and the <rs>Pacific</rs>, both in anticipation of the future development of the country rather than in response to any demand then existing, having been substantially completed, or suspended for an indefinite time, a large amount of capital so invested was found for the time unproductive, and a great number of laborers were left in the <rs>Pacific States</rs> without any possible employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>The great majority of these laborers were, as usual, without any accumulated means to pay their transportation to any other part of the country, and hence were left to drift as they might toward the <rs>East</rs>, subsisting by whatever means they could find during their long tramp of many hundreds of miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>Similar and other causes had produced at the same time industrial depression throughout the country, so that the <pb id="p.492" n="492"/> unfortunate laborers drifting eastward were only an additional burden upon communities already overloaded with unemployed labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>Thus the borrowing of foreign capital to put into unprofitable investments, and the employment of great numbers of laborers in making premature developments, met with the consequences which are sure to follow disregard of natural laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>The management of the <rs>Pacific</rs> railroads did not appear to appreciate the wisdom of mitigating, so far as was in their power, the evil which had resulted from their own policy, by giving free transportation to the laborers who had been stranded on the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>Hence all the transcontinental roads were soon blocked by lawless seizures of trains, and suffered losses far greater than they saved in transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>Indeed, the requisite transportation of destitute laborers eastward would have cost the roads practically nothing, while their losses resulting from not providing it were very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>Every possible effort was made for a long time to deal effectively with this evil by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings; but such methods proved entirely inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>The government was finally compelled, in consequence of the almost total interruption of interstate commerce and of the transportation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> mails and troops, to assume military control along the lines of all the <placeName key="tgn,7014680;tgn,7014652" n="0.003 000000.1636	placename;tgn,7014680;pacific coast, united states, north and central america,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7014652;pacific ocean," reg="pacific coast, united states, north and central america,United States,North and Central America;pacific ocean,">Pacific</placeName> roads, and direct the department commanders to restore and maintain, by military force, traffic and transportation over those roads.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/>For some time these lawless acts did not seem to result from any general organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>But they gradually developed into the formidable character of a wide-spread conspiracy and combination, with recognized general leaders, to obstruct and prevent the due execution of the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> respecting transportation and interstate commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>The principal center of this conspiracy, and by far the most formidable combination, <pb id="p.493" n="493"/> was in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 18" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, where the greatest material interests, both public and private, were at stake, though many other important railroad centers and many <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> of road were involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>There the insurrection was so great in numbers and so violent in its acts as to require the most prompt and energetic action of a very large force to suppress disorder, protect property, and execute the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>The city police were utterly powerless in such an emergency, and deputy <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> marshals, though employed without limit as to numbers, were no more effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>The State militia were not called out in time to meet the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>Hence nothing remained but for the <rs>National Government</rs> to exercise the military power conferred upon it by the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws, so far as the same were applicable.<note anchored="yes">

<p>See the report of <persName n="Olney,Attorney-General,,,," id="n0131.0028.00493.03714" reg="mostcommon:Olney,Atty,,,:1"><roleName n="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</roleName> <surname>Olney</surname></persName>, <dateStruct value="1894-12-01"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1894">1894</year></dateStruct>, <ref n="page 31">p. 31</ref>.</p></note> Fortunately, the acts of Congress passed in pursuance of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, although never before made effective in a similar case, were found to give ample authority for the action then required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>Fortunately, also, the wise foresight of the government in establishing a large military post at <placeName reg="Fort Sheridan">Fort Sheridan</placeName>, near <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 18" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, made a regiment of infantry, a squadron of cavalry, and a battery of artillery immediately available for service in that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>But, unfortunately, the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of that department was absent from his command, where superior military capacity was so much needed at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>Although the troops west of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> had been engaged for a long time, under the <rs>President</rs>'s orders, in overcoming the unlawful obstruction of railroad traffic above referred to, the general appears not to have anticipated any emergency which would in his judgment require or justify such use of the troops in his own department, and hence remained in the <rs>Eastern States</rs>, where he had gone some time before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>From this it resulted that when the troops at <placeName reg="Fort Sheridan">Fort Sheridan</placeName> were ordered into <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 18" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, <pb id="p.494" n="494"/> the execution of the order devolved on subordinate officers, and the troops were so dispersed as to be unable to act with the necessary effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>It having become apparent that the services of troops would probably be required in the city of <placeName reg="Chicago, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7013596">Chicago</placeName>, and in anticipation of orders from the <rs>President</rs>, instructions were telegraphed on <dateStruct value="-07-2"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="2">2</day></dateStruct> to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of the <orgName n="Department of the Missouri" type="department">Department of the Missouri</orgName> to make preparations to move the garrison of <placeName reg="Fort Sheridan">Fort Sheridan</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Lake Front Park</rs> in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>The next day (<dateStruct value="-07-3"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="3">3</day></dateStruct>), in the <rs>President</rs>'s room at the <rs>Executive Mansion</rs>, in reply to my suggestion that his presence was needed with his command, <persName n="Miles,General,,,," id="n0131.0028.00494.03717" reg="nearbymention:Miles,Nelson,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Miles</surname></persName> said he was subject to orders, but that in his opinion the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>No reply was made by the <rs>President</rs> or the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, who was also present, to that expression of opinion, but the <rs>President</rs> approved my further suggestion that <persName n="Miles,General,,,," id="n0131.0028.00494.03718" reg="nearbymention:Miles,Nelson,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Miles</surname></persName> should return at once to his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>The general started by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> train, but could not reach <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 18" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> in time to meet the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>It became necessary in the judgment of the <rs>President</rs> to order the <rs>Fort Sheridan</rs> garrison into the city in the afternoon of the same day (<dateStruct value="-07-3"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="3">3</day></dateStruct>).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>The instructions given the day before about moving the troops to <placeName reg="Lake Front Park">Lake Front Park</placeName> were not complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>From that point they could most readily have protected the sub-treasury, custom-house, <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, and other <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> property, and also have acted in a formidable body at any other point where their services <pb id="p.495" n="495"/> might properly have been required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>But instead of that, the troops were so dispersed that they could not act with much effect anywhere, and could give no protection whatever to the vast amount of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> property exposed to destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>This error appears to have resulted in some measure from the too great deference paid by commanding officers to the advice or wishes of civil officers to whom they were referred for information, and much more from lack of knowledge of the lawful relations existing between the national troops and the civil authorities in this country, although those relations had been plainly defined in an order dated <dateStruct value="-05-25"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="25">25</day></dateStruct>, quoted below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>Like ignorance in respect to the proper tactical methods of dealing with insurrection against the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> caused halting and ineffective action of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>To correct this error and make known to all the rules which must govern <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName> in all like emergencies, the subjoined order, dated <dateStruct value="-07-9"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="9">9</day></dateStruct>, was issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>The extracts from correspondence quoted below indicate the nature of the errors above referred to, and their correction some time after the arrival of <persName n="Miles,General,,,," id="n0131.0028.00495.03719" reg="nearbymention:Miles,Nelson,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Miles</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 18" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>The garrison of <placeName reg="Fort Sheridan">Fort Sheridan</placeName> proved sufficient, notwithstanding the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> faulty disposition and action of the troops, to hold the mob in check until reinforcements arrived from distant stations and the <rs>State</rs> troops were brought into effective action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>Finally, the proclamation of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, quoted below, which was issued at the moment when ample military forces had been placed in position to enforce his constitutional mandates, very quickly terminated all forcible resistance to the execution of the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>The same result, though perhaps with greater destruction of life and far less destruction of property, would probably have been accomplished in a single day by the <rs>Fort Sheridan</rs> garrison alone, acting in <num value="1">one</num> compact body, according to <pb id="p.496" n="496"/> the tactics prescribed for such service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>If a like occasion ever again occurs, the action of the troops will doubtless be governed by such tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>Delay is too dangerous in such cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5065"/>The following instructions are published for the government of the army:</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5067"/>Troops called into action against such a mob are governed by the general regulations of the army and military tactics in respect to the manner in which they shall act to accomplish the desired end. It is purely a tactical question in what manner they shall use the weapons with which they are armed&mdash;whether by the fire of musketry and artillery, or by use of the bayonet and saber, or by both, and at what stage of the operations each or either mode of attack shall be employed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5068"/>This tactical question must necessarily be decided by the immediate commander of the troops, according to his best judgment of the situation and the authorized drill regulations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5069"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stage of an insurrection lawless mobs are frequently commingled with great crowds of comparatively innocent <pb id="p.505" n="505"/> people drawn there by curiosity and excitement, and ignorant of the great danger to which they are exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5070"/>Under such circumstances the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> should withhold the fire of his troops, if possible, until timely warning has been given to the innocent to separate themselves from the guilty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5071"/>Under no circumstances are the troops to fire into a crowd without the order of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, except that single sharp-shooters, selected by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, may shoot down individual rioters who have fired upon or thrown missiles at the troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5072"/>As a general rule, the bayonet alone should be used against mixed crowds in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stages of a revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5073"/>But as soon as sufficient warning has been given to enable the innocent to separate themselves from the guilty, the action of the troops should be governed solely by the tactical considerations involved in the duty they are ordered to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5074"/>They are not called upon to consider how great may be the losses inflicted upon the public enemy, except to make their blows so effective as to promptly suppress all resistance to lawful authority, and to stop the destruction of life the moment lawless resistance has ceased.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s proclamation was strictly limited to <q direct="unspecified">the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and protecting its property, and removing obstructions to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> mails,</q> for which purpose the proclamation stated <q direct="unspecified">the <rs>President</rs> has employed a part of the military forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></q>&mdash;not <hi rend="italics">is about to employ</hi>, but <hi rend="italics">has employed</hi>, under specific orders, which were telegraphed to <persName n="Martin,Colonel,,,," id="n0131.0028.00507.03752" reg="nearbymention:Martin,J.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Martin</surname></persName> on <dateStruct value="-07-3"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="3">3</day></dateStruct>, to do certain things which were precisely the things specified in the proclamation of <dateStruct value="-07-8"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="8">8</day></dateStruct>, and not <q direct="unspecified">to aid the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> marshals</q> in doing those things or any others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>Yet it was not until <dateStruct value="-07-9"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="9">9</day></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="-07-6"><day reg="6">six</day></dateStruct> days after the order to <persName n="Martin,Colonel,,,," id="n0131.0028.00507.03753" reg="nearbymention:Martin,J.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Martin</surname></persName>, that those duties became <q direct="unspecified">clearly defined,</q> and then they were misunderstood in the very essential particulars above specified.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>Yet as soon as full discretionary authority was given to the several department commanders to act promptly as each emergency might require, all obstruction to the operations of the <rs>Pacific</rs> railroads rapidly disappeared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>The ordinary course of judicial proceedings is generally far too slow to produce satisfactory results when military force is required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>Fortunately the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws <pb id="p.508" n="508"/> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> do not require such ineffective mixture of civil and military methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>When the civil power ceases to be effective and the <rs>President</rs> is required to exercise his authority as commander-in-chief of the army, his acts become purely military, untrammeled by any civil authority whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>This is perhaps <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest and most valuable provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> which, if generally known, is most likely to deter the lawless from any attempt to act in defiance of the judicial authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>The <rs n="General Order 15" type="misc">General Order No. 15</rs>, issued at the time herein referred to (<dateStruct value="1894-05-25"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1894">1894</year></dateStruct>), was based upon the foregoing interpretation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>Under the <rs>Constitution</rs> and existing statutes of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> it is not proper to use the troops, either in large or small numbers, to <q direct="unspecified">aid the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> marshals.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>When the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Officer">civil officers</rs>, with their civil posse, are no longer able to enforce the laws, they stand aside, and the military power, under the orders of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>, steps in and overcomes the lawless resistance to authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5102"/>Then the civil officers resume their functions, to make arrests of individuals, hold them in custody, and deliver them to the courts for trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5103"/>It is not the duty of the troops in such cases to guard prisoners who are in the custody of civil officers; but it is the duty of the troops, if necessary, to repel by force of arms any unlawful attempt to rescue such prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/>This distinction should be clearly understood by all army officers, and it is of universal application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/>Tle duty of the army is, when so ordered by the <rs>President</rs>, to overcome and suppress lawless resistance to civil authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/>There military duty ends, and the civil officers resume their functions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>The distinction between the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and that of the several States is so clearly defined that there can be no possible excuse for ignorance on that subject on the part of any officer of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/>But <pb id="p.509" n="509"/> the relation between the civil and the military authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had not been clearly defined, after the passage of the <q direct="unspecified">Posse Comitatus Act,</q> until the order of <dateStruct value="1894-05-25"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1894">1894</year></dateStruct>, was issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5109"/>But that can hardly excuse continued ignorance of the law a month or more after that order was issued; and it is worthy of note that at least <num value="1">one</num> department commander showed himself familiar with the law before the order was issued, by correcting the mistake of a subordinate, which called attention to the necessity of issuing some such order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5110"/>Of course that order had the sanction of the <rs>President</rs>, after consideration and approval by the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>, before it was issued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/>The acts of Congress creating the <rs>Pacific</rs> railroads and making them military roads justify and require that the government give them military protection whenever, in the judgment of the <rs>President</rs>, such protection is needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5112"/>It is not incumbent on the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5113"/>It appears to have been almost forgotten that the transcontinental railroads were built, at great expense to the national treasury, <hi rend="italics">mainly as a military bond</hi> between the <rs>Atlantic States</rs> and the <rs>Pacific States</rs>, and that this is by far their most important service, and this explains the meaning of the language employed in the acts of Congress creating them.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5135"/>in my opinion, the most important of all the lessons taught by the <rs>Civil War</rs> is the necessity of using in the most effective manner the means at the disposal of the government when war breaks out. The necessity for adequate preparation is a different question, which has been much discussed, and in regard to which some progress has been made toward a satisfactory solution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5136"/>Whatever the outcome may be in respect to preparation for war, certainly the government and the people ought to adopt such a policy as will lead to the best practicable use of the preparations which have actually been made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5137"/>In this respect the policy adopted by the <rs>National Government</rs> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was about as weak as possible, while that of the <rs>Confederates</rs> was comparatively strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5138"/>It is said that this weak policy was due largely to <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0131.0029.00513.03765" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, and grew out of his distrust of volunteer troops; he having thought it necessary to have a considerable body of regular troops to give steadiness and confidence to the volunteers or militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5139"/>This is a very good theory, no <pb id="p.514" n="514"/> doubt, provided the regulars could be provided in advance in such numbers as to produce the desired effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5140"/>But if that theory had been relied upon in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></q> would have established their independence long before the regular army could be organized and made effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5141"/>What was demanded by the necessities of the country in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was the best large army that could be made in the shortest possible time, not a better small army to be made in a much longer time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5142"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> actually had at hand the means of creating in a very short time a far larger efficient army than the <rs>South</rs> could possibly have raised in the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5143"/>This means had been provided, with great care and at great expense, through a long term of years, by the education of young men at the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, and their practical training in the small regular army in all kinds of actual service, including <num value="1">one</num> foreign war and almost constant campaigns against the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>Nowhere in the world could have been found a better corps of officers to organize, instruct, and discipline new troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5145"/>Yet those officers were hardly employed at all in that service at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, when it was of supreme importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5146"/>Some time later, when the necessity was not so great, a few officers of the army were permitted to accept commands in the volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5147"/>Even then it often required great <q direct="unspecified">influence</q> to secure such <q direct="unspecified">indulgences.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5148"/>Scores of young officers, qualified in every way to do such service in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> of the war, sought in vain for opportunities to render the valuable services for which the government had educated them, and were compelled to drag along <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> in the discharge of duties several grades below their qualifications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>In the regular army in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> there were, exclusive of those who went South, at least <num value="600">600</num> officers who, after graduating at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, had served several years with their regiments, and were well qualified to drill a regiment <pb id="p.515" n="515"/> and to command it in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>A large proportion of them were fitted to command brigades, and some of them divisions, and even <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>The <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> volunteers <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> called out could have been fully supplied with brigade, division, and corps commanders from graduates of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> who were thoroughly qualified by theoretical education and established character, and many of them by practical experience in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war and <name>Indian</name> campaigns, for the instruction, discipline, and command of troops, still leaving a sufficient number with the regulars for efficient service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5152"/>The old sergeants of the army in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> were relatively competent company commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5153"/><num value="1">One</num> commissioned officer to <num value="4">four</num> companies of those veteran Indian-fighters made as reliable a battalion as any general could wish for in the conditions then existing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/>Experience demonstrated that a volunteer regiment could in a very few weeks be converted into an efficient and thoroughly reliable force in battle by a single young officer of the regular army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>In other words, by a judicious use of the small body of officers whom the country had educated at so great expense, a fine army of <num value="500000">500,000</num> men, or more, could have been called into service, organized, disciplined, and put into the field by <dateStruct value="1861-08-01"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; and that without interfering in any way with the <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> militia called out to meet the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> emergency, which militia ought, of course, to have acted strictly on the defensive until the more permanent force could take the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>In a few months more, certainly by the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, the instruction, discipline, and field experience of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> levy would have given good officers enough to organize and command a <num value="1000000">million</num> more men. It required, in short, only a wise use of the national resources to overwhelm the <rs>South</rs> before the spring of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>The supply of arms, it is true, was deplorably deficient in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>But the <rs>South</rs> was only a little better off than the <rs>North</rs> in that regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5159"/>Besides, the <rs>National Government</rs> <pb id="p.516" n="516"/> had command of all the markets of the world, and of the means of ocean transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5160"/>It could have bought at once all the available arms everywhere, and thus fully equipped its own troops, while preventing the <rs>South</rs> from doing the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5161"/>Hence the excuse given at the time&mdash;namely, want of muskets&mdash;was no excuse whatever for delay in the organization of armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5162"/>The rebellion made some progress at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and offered effective resistance for a long time, simply because the <rs>Southern</rs> authorities manifested greater military wisdom than the <rs>Northern</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>The difference in preparation and in military training in advance was quite insignificant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/>The <rs>North</rs> had many more educated and competent military men than the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5165"/>The difference was that the <rs>South</rs> used the few they had to the best advantage, while the <rs>North</rs> so used only a very few of their many.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5166"/>The lesson next in importance taught by our experience is the necessity of general military education in a country having a popular government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/>No man can be fully qualified for the duties of a statesman until he has made a thorough study of the science of war in its broadest sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>He need not go to a military school, much less serve in the army or in the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>But unless he makes himself thoroughly acquainted with the methods and conditions requisite to success in war, he is liable to do almost infinite damage to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/>For example, the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> success of the <rs>Union</rs> armies&mdash;the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>&mdash;was quickly followed by a proclamation of thanksgiving and an order to stop recruiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>That <num value="1">one</num> act of <q direct="unspecified">statesmanship</q> cost the country untold <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars and many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5172"/>It was necessary only to take the ordinary military advantage of the popular enthusiasm throughout the country after <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00516.03766" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victory to have made the <rs>Union</rs> armies absolutely irresistible by any force the <rs>South</rs> could raise and arm at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5173"/><pb id="p.517" n="517"/></p> 
<p>There has been much irrelevant discussion about the ability or inability of commanders in the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5174"/>The fact is that political instead of military ideas controlled in very large degree the selection of commanders in the <rs>Union</rs> armies; while for <num value="3">three</num> whole years the authorities in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> could not see the necessity of unity of action in all the armies under <num value="1">one</num> military leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5175"/>It required <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of costly experience to teach the government that simple lesson, taught in the military text-books!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5176"/>As experience finally proved, there was no lack of men capable of leading even large armies to victory; but, with few exceptions, they were not put in command until many others had been tried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5177"/>Information as to military fitness was not sought from military sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5178"/>If a lawyer is wanted for the supreme bench, or an engineer to construct a great bridge, information is sought from the best men of the profession concerned; but the opinions of politicians were thought sufficient in determining the selection of major-generals!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5179"/>Again, the policy of the government required the capture and occupation of all the important seaports and other places in the <rs>South</rs>, and the permanent occupation and protection of all the territory gained in military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5180"/>Until near the close of the war, neither the public nor the government seemed to have the remotest conception of the fundamental fact that <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, wherever they might go, instead of places and States, were the only real objectives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5181"/>Even some of the best Union generals were constrained to act upon this popular heresy, contrary to their own sound military judgment and education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5182"/>Yet while this erroneous <q direct="unspecified">territorial</q> strategy was insisted on, no adequate conception was formed of the vastly greater force required to hold all the territory gained, and to push aggressive operations still further into the heart of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5183"/>Very rarely indeed were the <rs>Union</rs> armies large enough, until <pb id="p.518" n="518"/> near the end of the war, to assure success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5184"/>The end finally came through a long succession of desperate battles between forces so nearly equal that decisive victory was impossible until the weaker side finally became exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5185"/>Thus the aggregate loss in men as well as in money was vastly greater than it would have been if the <rs>Union</rs> had put forth its full strength and ended the rebellion in <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> instead of <num value="4">four</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5186"/>It is true that some of the worst of these <q direct="unspecified">blind guides</q> were men supposed to have a very high military education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5187"/>But if sound military education had been at all general in the country, statesmen would have known by what standard to judge of any <num value="1">one</num> man's fitness for high command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5188"/>It is true that no amount of military education can supply the place of military genius or create a great commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5189"/>It may possibly happen at any time that there may not be among all the living graduates of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00518.03767" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> or <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00518.03768" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> or <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00518.03769" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:2"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, or <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00518.03770" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:2"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> or <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00518.03771" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:3"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> or <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00518.03772" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Claiborne,Fox,,:2"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5190"/>So much greater the need of a well-educated staff and a well-disciplined army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5191"/>Nobody is wise enough to predict who will prove best able to command a great army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5192"/>But it is the easiest thing in the world to tell who can best create such an army and command its subdivisions, and this is the work to be done instantly upon the outbreak of war. The selection of commanders for the several armies, and, above all, of a general-in-chief, must of course be the most difficult; for it is not probable that any man young enough will have had any experience in such commands in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5193"/>But even this difficulty will disappear in a very great measure if statesmen will make the study of the art and science of war, instead of far less important subjects, a part of their pastime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5194"/>They will thus acquire the ability to judge, from personal acquaintance with military men and conversation with others best informed, of the relative fitness of officers for the highest commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5195"/><pb id="p.519" n="519"/></p> 
<p>There is no possible remedy for such evils as this country has suffered except general military education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5196"/>In my opinion, no man is fit for a seat in Congress unless he has such an education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5197"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing he ought to learn is the old and trite military maxim that the only way to carry on war economically is to make it <q direct="unspecified">short, sharp, and decisive.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5198"/>To dole out military appropriations in driblets is to invite disaster and ultimate bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5199"/>So it is in respect to the necessary preparations for war in time of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5200"/>No man is wise enough to tell when war will come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5201"/>Preparations are made upon the theory that it may come at any time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5202"/>If a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> are necessary for adequate preparation for defense, and you have spent only <num value="50">fifty</num> when war comes, you might as well have thrown your <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> into the sea. There is no such thing as partial defense in modern war. If there are weak points in your defenses, your enemy is sure to find them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5203"/>Indeed, he knows about them all the time, and will strike them at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5204"/>Then your whole costly system will be worthless.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5205"/>What would be thought of the business capacity of a man who would not insure his house or his store or his stock of goods against fire because he did not happen to have money enough in bank to pay the premium, but would have to borrow it at <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5206"/>Or of a man who would wait until he had realized the expected profit on a commercial venture before insuring the goods?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5207"/>If preparation for defense is the policy of a country, it would be little short of blindness to delay it on account of a temporary deficiency in the current revenues.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5208"/>All now admit that universal education is an indispensable requisite to fitness for universal suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5209"/>The most serious questions upon which a free people can be called to vote are: a question of war, a question of preparation for war, and a question of approval and support, or disapproval and condemnation, of an administration on account <pb id="p.520" n="520"/> of the mode in which war has been conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5210"/>Can this highest duty of the citizen be intelligently performed without military education?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5211"/>A sovereign <hi rend="italics">individual</hi> regards this as demanding the highest education and the ablest counsel he can possibly obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5212"/>Can sovereign <hi rend="italics"><num value="1000000">millions</num></hi> do it wisely without any education whatever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5213"/>I believe no proposition could possibly be plainer than that general military education is indispensable to good citizenship in this country, and especially to all who may be intrusted with high responsibilities in the legislative and executive departments of the <rs>National Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5214"/>What would be thought of a general of the army who tried to shield himself from censure or punishment behind his ignorance of the law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5215"/>Can a legislator be excused because he knows nothing of the art and science of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5216"/>If there is any <num value="1">one</num> offense in this country which ought never, under any circumstances, to be pardoned, it is ignorance in those who are trusted by the people to manage the affairs of their government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5217"/>As in the military, so in the civil departments of government, there are few greater crimes than that of seeking and assuming the responsibilities of an office for which the man himself knows he is not fit. It is nearly as great as that committed by the appointing power under similar circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5218"/>A system of general military education should of course include elementary training in all the schools, public and private, so that every boy, before he is <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> old, would know how to use the rifled musket in ranks, and be familiar with the simple evolutions of a company and battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5219"/>Young men never forget such training received when they are boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5220"/>The country would have in a few years several <num value="1000000">millions</num> of fairly well-trained young soldiers, requiring only competent officers and a few days' drill in regimental tactics to make a reliable army for any service this country will probably ever require of her volunteer soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5221"/>If it were a question of the invasion <pb id="p.521" n="521"/> of a foreign country against a modern veteran army, the case would be different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5222"/>But for defense against any possible landing of a hostile army on our shores, our available force ought to be so overwhelming in numbers as to far more than compensate for lack of experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5223"/>Yet it must not be forgotten that some training is <hi rend="italics">indispensable</hi>. No possible advantage in numbers can overcome the disadvantage resulting from total ignorance of tactics and of the use of the modern long-range rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5224"/>Good parents who apprehend evil effects from giving their boys military training ought to reflect that the boys will go, all the same, whether trained or not, when the country is threatened with invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5225"/>Then, if ignorant, they will simply be doomed to fall the victims of skilled marksmen to whose shots they know not how to reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5226"/>Possibly the most cruel fate which <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName> parents could prepare for their sons would be to keep then in ignorance of the highest duty their country may call upon them to perform, so that, unable to offer any effective resistance to invasion, they could only die in a hopeless effort to do their duty as citizen soldiers and patriots&mdash;or, worse, live only to be driven in disgrace from a field which a little education would have enabled them gloriously to win.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5227"/>There should be, under State authority, a general enrolment and organization of all the young men who have received military training, and places of rendezvous fixed at convenient centers at or near railway-stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5228"/><rs type="role" reg="Officer">Officers</rs> of all grades up to that of colonel should be appointed in advance, and occasional musters held under State laws, even if military exercises were not attempted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5229"/>Our colleges and high schools, besides the military academies of the country, are even now educating a fair percentage of young men to be officers of such an organization of enrolled regiments as that here suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5230"/>This percentage could easily be increased in accordance with the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5231"/>Besides, the retired men of the regiments <pb id="p.522" n="522"/> of the <orgName n="National Guard" type="guard">National Guard</orgName> in the several States might furnish some officers for the enrolled militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5232"/>But those well-trained and fully equipped regiments would be required to move with full ranks at once to the place of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5233"/>Hence their active members would not be available in the great expansion of the army in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> period of war. The organization of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Reserve">first reserve</orgName> must, for this reason, be entirely independent of the <orgName n="National Guard" type="guard">National Guard</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5234"/>A great and very important advance has already been made in bringing the regular army into close relations with the <orgName n="National Guard" type="guard">National Guard</orgName> of the several States, and in the employment of regular officers in disseminating military education, both theoretical and practical, throughout the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5235"/>These are among the most valuable services the regular army can render in time of peace, and they should be extended, if practicable, still further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5236"/>Especially in the <orgName n="State Artillery" type="artillery">State artillery</orgName>, which must soon be organized for war service in the new fortifications, instruction by regular officers will be indispensable, and this can best be given in conjunction with the regular garrisons, the same as in war service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5237"/>It would also be well to perfect an arrangement by which the new infantry regiments, when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> taking the field upon the breaking out of war, might be accompanied by small bodies of regulars, to lead the way and indicate by example what is to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5238"/>Experience has shown that under such example the rawest volunteers will be almost as stanch in battle as the regulars themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5239"/>The beneficial effect upon new troops of the example of men who have before been in battle is very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5240"/>Hence it is that old regiments should always be kept full by the addition of recruits, rather than that the casualties of service be replaced by new regiments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5241"/>What constitutes valuable education, military no less than civil, is often greatly misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5242"/>Elementary education and practical training are indispensable to everybody, while higher education may be rather injurious <pb id="p.523" n="523"/> than beneficial, unless it is so regulated as to cultivate the reasoning faculties and independence of thought, rather than mere acquisition of knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5243"/>Some notable examples of this have appeared in the military annals of this country, and no doubt in the civil also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5244"/>Men who had become famous military scholars were total failures in war, not only as commanders in the field, for which no amount of theoretical education alone can qualify a man, but also as military advisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5245"/>This was apparently because their elaborate studies had made them mere imitators or copyists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>Whatever originality of thought or power of invention they ever possessed had ceased to exist from disuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>They could plan and direct a campaign with absolute accuracy, according to the teachings of the great masters, for the well-defined purpose upon which those teachings had been based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/>But when a wholly new problem was presented to them, they had no conception of the right mode of solving it. The plan of <num value="1">one</num> great campaign was based absolutely upon the best-approved method of capturing a certain place, without any reference to what damage might or might not be done to the opposing army in that operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/>The plan of another great campaign had for its sole object the conquest and permanent occupation of a great territory, and was so conducted as to avoid the possibility of seriously hurting the enemy in that operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>Yet the theory upon which this last plan was based, as well as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, governed the policy of the government more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5251"/>It was not until <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00523.03773" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> took command of <q direct="unspecified">all the armies</q> that the true strategic principle governed the general military policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>In this connection, the story told by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00523.03774" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> himself about his military studies is very instructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>When asked by the representative of some friends who wished to present him a library for his new house in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, what military books he then had, so that they might not duplicate them, he replied that he did not <pb id="p.524" n="524"/> have any military books, and never had any, except the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> text-books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>No doubt <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00524.03775" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> might have profited by some additional study, but none at all was far better than so much as to have dwarfed his mind into that of an imitator of former commanders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>The development of great military ability in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0029.00524.03776" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, as the result of his own experience and independent thought,&mdash;that is, the independent development of his own native military genius,&mdash;is by far the most interesting part of his history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5256"/>In short, the great lesson taught by our own experience is that elementary military training should be universal, because every young man may be called upon to perform the duties of a soldier; that general military reading, and habits of independent thought upon all great military subjects, should be cultivated by all who aspire to any high place in life, because they may be called upon to discharge the highest possible duties of good citizens in peace or in war, namely, those connected with the national defense; that due preparation for defense ought to be made without delay, and the requisite means kept always ready; and, above all, that the best method of making the quickest possible effective use of those means ought to be fully matured and understood by all who may be called upon to execute the orders of the government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5257"/>It now seems to me amazing that the affairs of an enlightened nation could have been so badly managed as to leave the secession issue in doubt almost to the last moment of a <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> contest, as it is now well known it was. Probably the <num value="1">one</num> saving fact in all those years was that the young soldiers of the republic&mdash;and they were nearly all young then&mdash;knew little and cared less about the wrangling of self-seeking politicians and visionary doctrinaires in the rear, but fought steadily on to the end, never doubting for a moment the final triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5258"/>I have never been able to recall a single instance of doubt <pb id="p.525" n="525"/> manifested by any soldier in the field, though I did know a very few cases of officers of considerable rank, who thought they ought to have had more rank, who went to the rear and said something about failure in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5259"/>I believe now that it required only some <hi rend="italics">real</hi> emergency, such, for instance, as the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1863-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, to call forth the power of the <rs>North</rs> and crush the rebellion in <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. If any man thinks a great disaster would have disheartened the <rs>North</rs>, he knows nothing of the people of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5260"/>It was the slow waste of enormous resources and of latent military strength that at length made many even of the stoutest hearts begin to feel despondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5261"/>I do not believe there was any time when the people would not have responded with unanimity and enthusiasm to an appeal to put forth all their strength and end the rebellion at a single blow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5262"/>The <num value="1">one</num> lesson of reason and experience that I would impress upon my countrymen in every possible way is, when war or insurrection comes or is threatened, do not trifle with it. Do not invoke judicial proceedings, or call for <num value="75000">75,000</num> men; but call for <hi rend="italics">men</hi>, and let them come as many as will!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5263"/>If some of them do not get there in time, before it is all over, it will not cost much to send them home again!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5264"/>The services of the <rs>Pennsylvania</rs> reserve, though ready for the field, were actually, positively refused until after the disaster of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5265"/>The greatest wonder in the history of this wonderful republic is that the government actually survived such a military policy as that!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5266"/>In this connection, it ought to be distinctly understood that the great object of education at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> and other military schools is not to make high commanders, but to make thorough soldiers, men capable of creating effective armies in the shortest possible time, and of commanding comparatively small bodies of men. If great commanders are ever again required in this country, they <pb id="p.526" n="526"/> will come to the front in due time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5267"/>They cannot be selected in advance of actual trial in war. Even <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, though <num value="1">one</num> of the best schools in the world, can at the most only lay the foundation of a military education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5268"/>Each individual must build for himself upon that foundation the superstructure which is to mark his place in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5269"/>If lie does not build, his monument will hardly appear above the surface of the ground, and will soon be covered out of sight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5270"/>It is of vital importance that the necessity of providing for calling into active service a very large army in the shortest possible time be fully understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5271"/>It is assumed that every important seaport will in time be so fortified as to be safe against any <hi rend="italics">unsupported</hi> naval attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5272"/>Modern science has rendered this easy and certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5273"/>Hence a naval attack must necessarily be supported by the landing of a military force upon the open coast, to attack the land defenses in reverse; and such defenses are now far more vulnerable to attack in rear than those of former times.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5274"/>The sea-coasts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are many <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> in extent, and an attack may be made at any <num value="1">one</num> or several of the many important seaports in these long lines of coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5275"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can anticipate where the blow or blows may fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5276"/>Hence it is necessary to be prepared to resist an attempt to land at any <num value="1">one</num> of those many points which are of such importance as to tempt an enemy to attack them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5277"/>The railroad facilities of the country are such that the necessary armies can be moved to all exposed points in time to meet any emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5278"/>But the armies must be ready to move almost at a moment's notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5279"/>There will be no time to organize, much less to drill, new troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5280"/>Before that could be done, any <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of our largest seaport cities could be captured and destroyed, and the invading forces get back again on their transports, and under the protection of the guns of <pb id="p.527" n="527"/> their own fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5281"/>And even if we had a navy more powerful than that of our enemy, it alone could give us no adequate protection; for the enemy would be sure to select a point of attack where our navy was not at the time, and which it could not reach until too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5282"/>Indispensable as a navy is to this country, it cannot act any very important part in the defense of so extended a sea-coast unless it is many times more powerful than any fleet which an enemy may send to attack us. The enemy being free to choose his point of attack, we would require at or near every <num value="1">one</num> of the exposed points a fleet at least as large as his, or in the aggregate at least <num value="5">five</num> times as large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5283"/>No <num value="1">one</num>, it is presumed, contemplates the creation of any such navy as that in this country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5284"/>Indeed, it would be the height of folly to require the navy to take part in the defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5285"/>In a country having the situation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the navy is the <hi rend="italics">aggressive</hi> arm of the national military power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5286"/>Its function is to punish an enemy until he is willing to submit to the national demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5287"/>For this purpose entire freedom of action is essential; also secure depots whence supplies may be drawn and where necessary repairs may be made, and harbors where cruisers or other vessels may seek safety if temporarily overpowered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5288"/>Hence arises <num value="1">one</num> of the most important functions of the land defense: to give the aggressive arm secure bases of operation at all the great seaports where navy-yards or depots are located.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5289"/>It may be that in special cases military forces may be needed to act in support of naval operations, or to hold for a time important points in a foreign country; but such service must be only auxiliary, not a primary object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5290"/>Foreign conquest and permanent occupation are not a part of the policy of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5291"/>There is no division of opinion among standard naval and military authorities on this great subject; such standard authors as <persName n="Walker,Rear admiral,,,," id="n0131.0029.00527.03777" reg="mostcommon:Walker,Henry,H.,,:2"><roleName n="Rear admiral">Rear-Admiral</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mahan,Captain,,,," id="n0131.0029.00527.03778" reg="mostcommon:Mahan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mahan</surname></persName> have clearly set <pb id="p.528" n="528"/> forth the relative functions of the army and the navy in enforcing the military policy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5292"/>The military problem which this country must solve is to provide such means of aggressive and defensive action as to be able to enforce a due observance of American public law on this continent, and, while doing this, to defend itself against insult and spoliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5293"/>The land defenses, including torpedoes and in a few cases <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName>, should be entirely independent of the active navy, so that the latter may be free to act in <num value="1">one</num> compact mass against any enemy which may anywhere oppose it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5294"/>There will be another important necessity for very large forces of infantry and <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName>,&mdash;that is, large in the aggregate,&mdash;in the event of war with even a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-class naval power: to protect our long lines of open coast and small unfortified harbors from destruction by the guns and landing-parties of the enemy's light-draft cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5295"/>This would require a <q direct="unspecified">picket-line</q> with considerable <q direct="unspecified">reserves,</q> several <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5296"/>The national pride, if not the material interests involved, would not permit the government to submit to such destruction or spoliation without making every possible effort to prevent it. In short, unless the government and the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are willing to prepare in advance for putting into the field at a moment's notice a very large and effective army, as well as to fortify all important seaports, they may as well make up their minds to submit, at least for a time, to whatever indignity any considerable naval power may see fit to inflict upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5297"/>No half-way measures will do any good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5298"/>Fortifications without an army would be worth no more, against any country having a considerable army and navy, than an army without fortifications. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5300"/>another great lesson taught by our Civil War, perhaps even more important than any other, is the financial lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5301"/>An established government which has a place to maintain among the commercial nations of the world must maintain its credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5302"/>It must purchase its supplies and munitions of war and pay its troops <hi rend="italics">in money</hi>. In a great and prolonged war it is not possible for the people to contribute all the means required at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5303"/>The amount of taxation would be greater than any people could bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5304"/>Hence the government must borrow the necessary money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5305"/>This cannot be done without national credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5306"/>If credit declines, rates of interest and discount on securities increase until the national debt reaches its limit and no more money can be borrowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5307"/>In short, the nation becomes bankrupt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5308"/>This was the condition of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> before the close of the late <rs>Civil War</rs>. With a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men on the muster-and pay-rolls, including several great armies of veteran troops in the field, <pb id="p.530" n="530"/> while the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> was reduced to a very small fraction of that number, the <rs>Union</rs> cause was on the very verge of failure, because the government could no longer raise money to pay its troops, purchase supplies, or make any further use of its magnificent armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5309"/>This astounding fact was confided to the generals of the army in the winter of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">5</year></dateStruct> by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, who then said the rebellion must be suppressed in the coming spring campaign, or tile effort abandoned, because the resources of the treasury were exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5310"/>In corroboration of my recollection on this subject, I now find the following in a private letter written by me at that time: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5322"/>People engaged in an effort to throw off their dependency or political connection, and establish their own independence, or a country defending itself against a powerful adversary, may be compelled to resort to forced loans, in the absence <pb id="p.531" n="531"/> of national credit, to carry on the war. But in a great country with unlimited resources, like the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, resort to forced loans would seem to be entirely unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5323"/>However this may be, and whatever may be the necessity in any case, a forced loan, <hi rend="italics">without interest</hi>, is simple robbery to the extent of unpaid interest, even if the principal is paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5324"/>And a robber cannot expect to have much credit left after his character becomes known to the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5325"/>The issue of legal-tender notes during the <rs>Civil War</rs> was of this character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5326"/>The country received a deadly blow to its financial credit when that policy was adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5327"/>Nations or peoples cannot, any more than individuals, violate the established rules of honest dealing without suffering the just penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5328"/>If money is needed beyond current revenues, there is no other honest way to get it but by borrowing it at such rate of interest and upon such security as can be agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5329"/>Besides, to leave any room for doubt or cavil about the conditions of a loan, or about the standard of money in which principal and interest are to be paid, necessarily arouses suspicion of bad faith, and hence destroys or seriously injures national credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5330"/>It is now perfectly well known to all who have taken the pains to study the subject that this false and practically dishonest policy, however innocently it may have been conceived, cost the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> many hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars, and cane very near bringing disaster upon the <rs>Union</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5331"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most astounding spectacles ever presented in the history of the world was that presented by this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5332"/>It went into the war practically free from debt, and came out of it with a debt which seemed very large, to be sure, and was in fact nearly twice as large as it ought to have been, yet so small in comparison with the country's resources that it could be paid off in a few years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5333"/>It went into the war practically without an army, and came out of the war <pb id="p.532" n="532"/> with its military strength not even yet fully developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5334"/>It had more than a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, nearly all veterans, in the ranks, and could have raised a <num value="1000000">million</num> more, if necessary, without seriously interfering with the industries of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5335"/>Yet in <num value="4">four</num> short years a false financial policy destroyed the national credit, brought its treasury to bankruptcy, and thus reduced a great people to a condition in which they could no longer make any use of their enormous military strength!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5336"/>This lesson ought to be taught in every school-house in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, until every child is made to understand that there is no such thing in the world as paper money; that the only real money in the world is standard <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>; that paper can be used in the place of money only when it represents the real <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> in which it can at any time be redeemed; that even <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> can be used together as standard money only under their real intrinsic values as recognized by all the world; that any attempt to force either <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> into unlimited circulation, under any arbitrary ratio different from their real ratio, is not honest; and that dishonesty is the worst of all financial policies, as well as the most unworthy of a civilized people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5337"/>The laws of finance, like the laws of military strategy, were never invented by anybody, any more than the law of gravitation or the law of electrical attraction and repulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5338"/>They have all been learned by the experience and study of mankind since the dawn of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5339"/>All alike are parts of the great laws of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5340"/>They should be carefully and diligently studied and taught in all the schools, until the rising generation understand that all the affairs of mankind are governed by the uniform laws established by the great Creator and Ruler of the universe; and that self-appointed <q direct="unspecified">leaders of the people</q> who would entice them to follow their own inventions cannot save them from the penalties which naturally <pb id="p.533" n="533"/> follow the violation of any of the laws of the universe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5341"/>In short, education,&mdash;wisely directed education,&mdash;both in science and in morals, is the <num value="1">one</num> indispensable foundation of good popular government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5342"/>The relative importance to be attached to the many branches of popular education demands the careful consideration of all educators, and still more the <hi rend="italics">purity</hi> of the doctrines taught in all the schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5343"/>There is good reason to believe that this last duty has been much neglected, especially in respect to financial theories.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5344"/>In this connection, it is worthy of serious consideration whether <num value="1">one</num> of the teachings of a corrupt age has not found its way into that almost sacred writing, the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5345"/>What right has Congress, or any other department of government, or any government on earth, to <q direct="unspecified">regulate the value</q> of money, any more than that of wheat or corn?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5346"/>Is not the real value of money, like that of everything else, regulated by the general law of supply and demand throughout the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5347"/>Ought not the value of money, and what shall constitute money, be left, without governmental interference, to be determined by the common consent of mankind?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5348"/>Must not commercial intercourse among all the countries of the world necessarily regulate all this, in spite of the decrees of government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5349"/>Ought not the function of government in this regard to be limited to the coining of money and stamping on its face its real value&mdash;that is, in effect, the amount of <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> it actually contains?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5350"/>In short, is not the attempt of government to make a certain weight of <num value="1">one</num> thing equal to a certain weight of another thing a plain violation of a natural law, and hence necessarily vicious?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5351"/>Is not all our serious monetary controversy in this country the result of vicious teaching to be found in our own Constitution, inherited from a corrupt age, when the fiat of a prince was thought sufficient to make a coin worth more than it was in fact?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5352"/>Where did <pb id="p.534" n="534"/> so many of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> learn the heretical doctrine of fiat money?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5353"/>Is it not taught in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5354"/>It so seems to me, and hence it seems to me that the people should at once strike at the very root of the evil, and eradicate from their fundamental law the theory that the value of anything can be regulated by arbitrary fiat, in violation of natural law. Let the people restore to themselves their inalienable right to liberty of trade, so that they can deal with each other in gold, or in silver, or in cotton, or in corn, as they please, and pay in what they have agreed to pay in, without impertinent interference from legislators or anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5355"/>Then, and only then, can the monetary system of this country be placed on a sound foundation, and all the <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> of our mines, as well as all other products of human industry, and the people who produce or own them, become truly free.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5356"/>Another important lesson taught by our experience since the <rs>Civil War</rs>, no less than at the commencement of that period, is that prompt and vigorous action, in accordance with established military methods, whenever military force must be employed, necessarily presupposes such knowledge of the laws on the part of department and army commanders as will justify the <rs>President</rs> in intrusting them with discretionary authority to act without specific orders in each case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5357"/>Such emergencies as that of <dateStruct value="1894--"><year reg="1894">1894</year></dateStruct>, for example, give striking proof of the necessity for the higher education to fit men for high command in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5358"/>It is not mainly a question of <hi rend="italics">military</hi> education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5359"/>Early deficiencies in that respect may soon be overcome by the constant practice afforded by active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5360"/>The indispensable necessity is for <hi rend="italics">education in general</hi>, and especially in those things which army officers are not habitually required to know, but which are of vital importance to those who must, in great emergencies, be intrusted with great responsibilities and <pb id="p.535" n="535"/> with discretionary authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5361"/>That very emergency of <dateStruct value="1894--"><year reg="1894">1894</year></dateStruct> gave examples of officers, not educated at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> nor at any other military school, distinguished for gallant and efficient military service in the field, who proved to be perfectly familiar with the principles of constitutional and military law which ought to govern the action of troops under circumstances like those of <dateStruct value="1894--"><year reg="1894">1894</year></dateStruct>; while others, distinguished as commanders in the field, seemed strangely ignorant of both constitutional and military laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5362"/>It is also worthy of remark that such necessary legal education did not appear to be universal among the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> graduates at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5363"/>Some men who are not graduates of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> are much better qualified for high command than some who are.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5364"/>Much has been said about a supposed prejudice in the army against officers who have not enjoyed the advantages of education at the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5365"/>I aver, emphatically, that I have never seen any evidence of any such feeling, and I do not believe it has ever existed to any appreciable extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5366"/>On the contrary, the general feeling has been that of just and generous consideration for officers who were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> laboring under that disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5367"/>Some of the most popular men in the army have been among those appointed from civil life or from the volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5368"/><persName n="Terry,General,Alfred,H.,," id="n0131.0030.00535.03780" reg="default:Terry,Alfred,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Alfred</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Terry</surname></persName> was a fair example of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5369"/>He was a ripe scholar, a thorough lawyer, a very laborious student of the art and science of war,&mdash; more so than most <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> graduates,&mdash;and so modest that he hesitated to accept the appointment of brigadier-general in the regular army, although it had been given for so distinguished a service as the capture of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, on the ground that older officers who had devoted their whole lives to the military service were better entitled to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5370"/>The general feeling in the army has no special reference to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5371"/>It is a feeling, and a very strong <pb id="p.536" n="536"/> <num value="1">one</num>, in favor of <hi rend="italics">education</hi>, of qualification in all respects for the service which may be required, of that dignified self-respect and becoming modesty which prevent an officer from desiring a position for which he is not fully qualified, and, above all, that manly delicacy which makes it impossible for an officer to <hi rend="italics">seek</hi> a position which ought to be left to <hi rend="italics">seek him</hi>. As well might a maiden ask a man to marry her, or get some <num value="1">one</num> else to do it for her, as a soldier to seek in the same way a position on the staff of a general or of the <rs>President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5372"/>This is especially true in respect to the position of the <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>,</q> or general-in-chief, of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5373"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> being, by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, commanderin-chief of the army and navy, no law of Congress, even with his own consent, could relieve him from that responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5374"/>There is no law, and there could not constitutionally be any law passed, establishing any such office as that of commanding general of the army, and defining the duties and authority attached to it. Such a law would be a clear encroachment upon the constitutional prerogatives of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5375"/>The only constitutional relation in which the so-called <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>,</q> or <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>,</q> of the army can occupy is that usually called <q direct="unspecified">chief of the staff</q>&mdash;the chief military adviser and executive officer of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5376"/>He cannot exercise any command whatever independently of the <rs>President</rs>, and the latter must of necessity define and limit his duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5377"/>No other authority can possibly do it. In this regard the <rs>President</rs>'s power and discretion are limited only by his constitutional obligation to exercise the chief command himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5378"/>He can give his generalin-chief as much authority as he pleases consistently with that obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5379"/>Hence it is entirely in the discretion of the <rs>President</rs> to define and fix the relations which should exist between the general and the <rs>Secretary</rs> of War&mdash;a very difficult thing to do, no doubt,&mdash;at least <num value="1">one</num> which <pb id="p.537" n="537"/> seems never to have been satisfactorily done by any <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5380"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> and the general appear to have been left to arrange that as best they could, or to leave it unarranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5381"/>However this may be, the relations of the general to the <rs>President</rs> are, or ought to be, of the most confidential character, no less so than those of any member of the cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5382"/>And the necessity of that confidential relation is far more important than in the case of any cabinet officer, for the reason that it is brought into prominence in times of great emergency, when questions of peace and war are involved, and when the <rs>President</rs> is required to act upon momentous military questions about which he cannot, in general, have much knowledge, and hence must trust to the ability, judgment, discretion, and scientific military knowledge of the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5383"/>In such cases the general becomes, as it were, the <q direct="unspecified">keeper of the <rs>President</rs>'s conscience</q> in respect to the most momentous questions he can ever have to decide.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5384"/>It is necessarily extremely embarrassing to the <rs>President</rs> to be compelled to place or retain in that close, confidential, and important relation to himself an officer in whom he has not entire confidence in all respects; or else, as the only alternative, by selecting another, to cast a reflection upon the senior in rank, whose soldierly character and services may have entitled him to the highest distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5385"/>The situation is no less embarrassing, under the existing law and custom, to the officer who may at any time happen to be the senior in commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5386"/>He may be compelled to submit to the humiliation of being superseded by some junior in rank, or else to occupy a confidential position of great importance in the absence of that confidence which is necessary to make such a position even tolerable to himself or to the army, which must inevitably be deprived of his legitimate influence for good if he does not enjoy the confidence of the <rs>President</rs> and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5387"/>There can be no relief <pb id="p.538" n="538"/> from this dilemma, so embarrassing to both the <rs>President</rs> and the general, except by appropriate legislation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5388"/>The most important military reform now required in this country is a law authorizing the <rs>President</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">by and with the advice and consent of the <name>Senate</name>,</q> to appoint, not a commander of the army, but a <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>,</q> or <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="Chief of Staff">chief of staff</rs>,</q> to aid him (the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>) in the discharge of his military duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5389"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> ought to have the power to retire such officer at any time, with due regard for his rank and services, and to appoint another in the same manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5390"/>The title <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of the arm</q> is inappropriate and misleading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5391"/>There never has been any such office in this country, except that created especially for <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0030.00538.03781" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5392"/>The old title of <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>,</q> given to the officer at the head of the army before the <rs>Civil War</rs>, is the appropriate title in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5393"/>That officer is, in fact, the <rs type="role" reg="chief-General">chief general</rs>, but does not command the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5394"/>If it be considered the best policy to reserve the <num value="2">two</num> highest military grades,&mdash;those of general and lieutenant-general,&mdash;to be conferred only by special act of Congress for distinguished services, appropriate distinction may be given to the officer at the head of the army at any time by the title of general-in-chief, with such additional compensation as is necessary to defray his living expenses in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5395"/>Neither the rank nor the pay of an officer in a subordinate position can possibly be regarded as appropriate to <num value="1">one</num> in a higher grade of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5396"/>Every grade of public service should have an officer of appropriate rank and compensation, certainly the highest in any department even more than any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5397"/>The government of this country has not been duly regardful even of its own dignity and self-respect, in denying to its chief military officer appropriate rank, and in requiring him to expend all the savings of a lifetime to maintain his official position for a few years at the seat of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5398"/><pb id="p.539" n="539"/></p> 
<p>Not by any means the least benefit to be expected from a law authorizing each <rs type="role2">President</rs> to select his chief general, would be the education thus given to officers of the army in respect to the relation in which they stand to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>, and in respect to the reasonable limits of military ambition in a republic where the <rs>President</rs> is and must be commander-in-chief, whether he is a man of military education and experience or not.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5399"/>So strongly were these views impressed upon my mind by my studies of the subject, made at the request of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0030.00539.03782" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0030.00539.03783" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> many years ago, that when I became the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officer</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> I refrained scrupulously from suggesting to the <rs>President</rs> or the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> or anybody else that I had any expectation of being assigned to the command, or regarded myself as having any claim to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5400"/>The duties of patriotic citizenship in time of war have not always been duly appreciated, even by those most zealous in their loyalty to the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5416"/>Of course this great and cordial courtesy was very promptly returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5417"/>Upon the occasions of these visits at the office, the general would sit a long time, talking in his inimitably charming manner with me and the staff officers who came in with their morning business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5418"/>Then he would insist upon my going with him to call upon the <rs>President</rs>, a formality which was demanded by his high sense of the respect due from him and me together, as past and present commanding generals, to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5419"/>This high regard for military courtesy which was a characteristic of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0031.00541.03792" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, though he seemed comparatively indifferent to any lack of it toward himself, well merits the imitation of all military men.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5429"/>The subject of this volume being limited to events of which I have had personal knowledge, and it never having been my good fortune to serve in the field with <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0031.00542.03794" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, it would be inappropriate to make herein any general comments upon his military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5430"/>But I cannot close this account of events so closely connected with my own official life without making acknowledgment of my obligations to that great-hearted man for the justice, kindness, and generosity which he invariably manifested toward me whenever occasion offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5431"/><pb id="p.543" n="543"/></p> 
<p>It was <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0031.00543.03795" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> whose voluntary application, in the winter of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">4</year></dateStruct>, relieved me from the disagreeable controversy with partizan politicians in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and gave me command of an army in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5432"/>It was upon his recommendation that my services in that command were recognized by promotion from the grade of captain to that of brigadier-general in the regular army and brevet major-general for services in the <rs n="Battle of Franklin" type="battle">battle of Franklin</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5433"/>It was <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00543.03796" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> who, upon my suggestion, ordered me, with the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 23">Twenty-third Corps</orgName>, from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, to take part in the closing operations of the war, instead of leaving me where nothing important remained to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5434"/>It was he who paid me the high compliment of selecting me to conduct the operations which might be necessary to enforce the <rs>Monroe</rs> doctrine against the <rs>French</rs> army which had invaded <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5435"/>It was he who firmly sustained me in saving the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> from the worst effects of the congressional reconstruction laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5436"/>It was he who greeted me most cordially as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> in <dateStruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>, and expressed a desire that I might hold that office under his own administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5437"/>And, finally, it was he who promoted me to the rank of major-general in the regular army, the next day after his inauguration as <rs type="role2">President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5438"/>It was a great disappointment to me to find only casual mention of my name in <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0131.0031.00543.03797" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Memoirs.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5439"/>But I was not only consoled, but moved to deep emotion when told by his worthy son, <persName n="Grant,Colonel,Frederick,Dent,," id="n0131.0031.00543.03798" reg="default:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Frederick</foreName> <foreName>Dent</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, that his father had not ceased up to the last day of his life to cherish the same kind feeling he had always manifested toward me, and that <num value="1">one</num> of his last fruitless efforts, when he could no longer speak, was to put on paper some legible words mentioning my name.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5440"/><persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0131.0031.00543.03799" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> wrote that he could not understand <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00543.03800" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and doubted if <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00543.03801" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> understood himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5441"/>A very distinguished statesman, whose name I need not mention, <pb id="p.544" n="544"/> said to me that, in his opinion, there was nothing special in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00544.03802" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5442"/>Others have varied widely in their estimates of that extraordinary character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5443"/>Yet I believe its most extraordinary quality was its extreme simplicity&mdash;so extreme that many have entirely overlooked it in their search for some deeply hidden secret to account for so great a character, unmindful of the general fact that simplicity is <num value="1">one</num> of the most prominent attributes of greatness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5444"/>The greatest of all the traits of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00544.03803" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s character was that which lay always on the surface, visible to all who had eyes to see it. That was his moral and intellectual integrity, sincerity, veracity, and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5445"/>He was incapable of any attempt to deceive anybody, except for a legitimate purpose, as in military strategy; and, above all, he was incapable of deceiving himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5446"/>He possessed that rarest of all human faculties, the power of a perfectly accurate estimate of himself, uninfluenced by pride, ambition, flattery, or self-interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5447"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00544.03804" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was very far from being a modest man, as the word modest is generally understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5448"/>His just self-esteem was as far above modesty as it was above flattery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5449"/>The highest encomiums were accepted for what he believed them to be worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5450"/>They did not disturb his equilibrium in the slightest degree.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5451"/>While <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00544.03805" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> knew his own merits as well as anybody did, he also knew his own imperfections, and estimated them at their real value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5452"/>For example, his inability to speak in public, which produced the impression of extreme modesty or diffidence, he accepted simply as a fact in his nature which was of little or no consequence, and which he did not even care to conceal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5453"/>He would not for many years even take the trouble to jot down a few words in advance, so as to be able to say something when called upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5454"/>Indeed, I believe he would have regarded it as an unworthy attempt to appear in a false light if he had made preparations in advance for an <q direct="unspecified">extemporaneous</q> <pb id="p.545" n="545"/> speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5455"/>Even when he did in later years write some notes on the back of a dinner-card, he would take care to let everybody see that he had done so by holding the card in plain view while he read his little speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5456"/>After telling a story in which the facts had been modified somewhat to give the greater effect, which no <num value="1">one</num> could enjoy more than he did, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00545.03806" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> would take care to explain exactly in what respects he had altered the facts for the purpose of increasing the interest in his story, so that he might not leave any wrong impression.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5457"/>When <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00545.03807" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s attention was called to any mistake he had committed, he would see and admit it as quickly and unreservedly as if it had been made by anybody else, and with a smile which expressed the exact opposite of that feeling which most men are apt to show under like circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5458"/>His love of truth and justice was so far above all personal considerations that he showed unmistakable evidence of gratification when any error into which he might have fallen was corrected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5459"/>The fact that he had made a mistake and that it was plainly pointed out to him did not produce the slightest unpleasant impression, while the further fact that no harm had resulted from his mistake gave him real pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5460"/>In <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00545.03808" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s judgment, no case in which any wrong had been done could possibly be regarded as finally settled until that wrong was righted; and if he himself had been, in any sense, a party to that wrong, he was the more earnest in his desire to see justice done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5461"/>While he thus showed a total absence of any false pride of opinion or of knowledge, no man could be firmer than he in adherence to his mature judgment, or more earnest in his determination, on proper occasions, to make it understood that his opinion was his own, and not borrowed from anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5462"/>His pride in his own mature opinion was very great; in that he was as far as possible from being a modest man. This absolute confidence in his own judgment <pb id="p.546" n="546"/> upon any subject which he had mastered, and the moral courage to take upon himself alone the highest responsibility, and to demand full authority and freedom to act according to his own judgment, without interference from anybody, added to his accurate estimate of his own ability and his clear perception of the necessity for undivided authority and responsibility in the conduct of military operations, and in all that concerns the efficiency of armies in time of war, constituted the foundation of that very great character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5463"/>When summoned to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 30" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> to take command of all the armies, with the rank of lieutenant-general, he determined, before he reached the capital, that he would not accept the command under any other conditions than those above stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5464"/>His sense of honor and of loyalty to the country would not permit him to consent to be placed in a false position,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> in which he could not perform the service which the country had been led to expect from him, &mdash;and he had the courage to say so in unqualified terms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5465"/>These are the traits of character which made <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00546.03809" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> a very great man&mdash;the only man of our time, so far as can be known, who possessed both the character and the military ability which were, under the circumstances, indispensable in the commander of the armies which were to suppress the great rebellion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5466"/>It has been said that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00546.03810" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, like <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00546.03811" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:6"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, was a typical American, and for that reason was most beloved and respected by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5467"/>That is true of the statesman and of the soldier, as well as of the people, if it is meant that they were the highest type, that ideal which commands the respect and admiration of the highest and best in a man's nature, however far he may know it to be above himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5468"/>The soldiers and the people saw in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00546.03812" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> or in <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00546.03813" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:6"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, not <num value="1">one</num> of themselves, not a plain man of the people, nor yet some superior being whom they could not understand, but the personification of their highest ideal of a citizen, soldier, or statesman, a man whose greatness <pb id="p.547" n="547"/> they could see and understand as plainly as they could anything else under the sun. And there was no more mystery about it all in fact than there was in the popular mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5469"/>Matchless courage and composure in the midst of the most trying events of battle, magnanimity in the hour of victory, and moral courage to compel all others to respect his plighted faith toward those who had surrendered to him, were the crowning glories of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0131.0031.00547.03814" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Frederick,Dent,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s great and noble character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5470"/>On <dateStruct value="1895-09-29"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="29">29</day>, <year reg="1895">1895</year></dateStruct>, came the hour when I had done, however imperfectly, all the duty my country required of me, and I was placed on the retired list of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5471"/>Having been, at appropriate periods in my official career, by the unsolicited action of my official superiors, justly and generously rewarded for all my public services, and having been at the head of the army several years, near the close of the period fixed by law for active military service I was made the grateful recipient of the highest honor which the government of my country can confer upon a soldier, namely, that of appointment to a higher grade under a special act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5472"/>My public life was, in the main, a stormy <num value="1">one</num>, as this volume has, perhaps too fully, shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5473"/>Many times I felt keenly the injustice of those who did not appreciate the sincerity of my purpose to do, to the best of my ability, what the government desired of me, with little or no regard for my own personal opinions or ambitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5474"/>But I can now concede to nearly all those who so bitterly opposed me the same patriotic motives which I know inspired my own conduct; and I would be unworthy of my birthright as an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName> if I did not feel grateful to my countrymen and to our government for all the kindness they have shown me.</p>
