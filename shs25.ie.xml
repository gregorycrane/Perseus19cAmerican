<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>In this succinct, didactic narrative, not half justice could be done to these martys to civil liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Their lives and deaths were the most beautiful epic poems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>They will be sung and celebrated as long as liberty lasts; as long as a love for it sighs for its loss and their sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>There was nothing sordid or selfish in the high motives or objects of their death struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The chief injustice done to their memories is in seeming to think or say that they fought and died in vain for some mere material property, profit, advantage, or possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Nothing could be more unjust to them, or more untrue in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They were no hirelings; they were no men of <hi rend="italics">expediency</hi>. They loved virtue for virtue's sake, honor for honor's sake, justice for justice's sake, truth for truth's sake, right for right's sake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>They never stooped to ask: <q direct="unspecified">Will it pay?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>They had faith, feelings, affections, sense of the intellect to know their rights, and knowing them, the courage to maintain them through all hazards, and to the last extremity, they had a sense of honor, a sense of self-respect, a sense of wrong, a sense of duty and a physiical and moral power of resistance to the tyranny of usurpation and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Their physical power was expended in the war, but their <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> power still exists unimpaired, except by those who call their consecrated cause <q direct="unspecified">A Lost Cause;</q> except <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> by those who say that <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">the best they can do</hi></q> is to desert the faith of that cause; to lose its feelings and fortitudes; to take test oaths; to beg for pardons; to confess the charge of treason, not only to acknowledge the guilt of the highest felony known to the calendar of human crime, for themselves, but in fact and effect to inscribe treason on the graves of these heroic martyrs; to choose the school of morals which teaches the doctrine of taking lesser evils; to approve and endorse the blackest wrongs done to this generation and its heirs forever, against which these immolated comrades fought and died!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>This thing which we now hear called <q direct="unspecified">accepting the situation</q> is very different from the acceptance of the situation which these dead comrades made in the pride of patriotism when they accepted graves rather than servile submission, when they tasted death rather than <q direct="unspecified">eat dirt</q> and live!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>They made <num value="1000">thousands</num> of the foe <q direct="unspecified">bite the dust</q> rather than be conquered to wear chains by consent and approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>If they were traitors I and every leader of theirs who led them to battle and to death, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0283.0002.00021.00292" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and all, were murderers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They were not traitors, and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0283.0002.00021.00293" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and I and others whom they followed were not their murderers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The morale of their lives and deaths still lives in the memory of the glorious deeds they did, and their examples are immortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The rights for which they contended and their defence of those rights constituted <q direct="unspecified">the <hi rend="italics">Confederate Cause</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>And that cause is as undying as those rights are indestructible, and as their defence was glorious!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>They were true to that Cause, the substance of which was <hi rend="italics">not to be masters of slaves, but that others should not be their masters</hi>, and they were true to the last ditch of its defence, and to the death!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Yes! After the bones of these devoted martyrs shall have mouldered into dust; after the deserters of their faith and memories and examples shall have died in the easiest situations which they can accept, and they and their treason shall have rotted and been forgotten, the cause of freedom for which these noble Confederates fell&mdash;the freedom of conscience and the freedom of self-government, guarded by a standard of fundamental law of its honest administration&mdash;the <rs>Confederate Cause</rs> shall survive and revive and find champions, though its champions for the time be made martyrs!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The blood of these martyrs shall be the seeds of new life and new liberty for all the ages of time!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>and the moral monuments of <q direct="unspecified">These True Men,</q> without marble and without brass, shall be eternal!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>He had not, at that time, mingled largely in federal politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>He had made but few enemies, and had not <quote>staled his presence,</quote> but was in all the freshness of his unmatched faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>At this day it is difficult for anyone to appreciate the enthusiasm which greeted this gifted man, the admiration which was felt for him, and the affection which followed him. He was to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, in her youth, what <persName n="Lind,,Jenny,,," id="n0283.0003.00023.00314" reg="default:Lind,Jenny,,,"><foreName>Jenny</foreName> <surname>Lind</surname></persName> is to the musical world, or what <persName n="Fox,,Charles,,," id="n0283.0003.00023.00315" reg="default:Fox,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Fox</surname></persName>, whom he resembled in many things, was to the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName></orgName> in his day. Why he was so is not difficult to see. He was a type of his times, a representative of the qualities of the people, or rather of the better qualities of the wilder and more impetuous part of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The proportion of young men, as in all new countries, was great, and the proportion of wild young men, was unfortunately, still greater.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> He had all those qualities which make us charitable to the character of <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Hal</foreName></persName>, as painted by <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00023.00316" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, even when our approval is not fully bestowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Generous as a prince of the royal blood, brave and chivalrous as a Knight Templar, of a spirit that scorned everything mean, underhanded or servile, he was prodigal to improvidence, instant in resentment, and bitter in his animosities, yet magnanimous to forgive when reparation had been made or misconstruction explained away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>There was no littleness about him. Even toward an avowed enemy he was open and manly, and bore himself with a sort of antique courtesy and knightly hostility, in which self respect, mingled with respect for his foe, except when contempt was mixed with hatred; then no words can convey any sense of the intensity of his scorn, the depth of his loathing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>When he thus outlawed a man from his courtesy and respect, language could scarce supply words to express his disgust and detestation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> Fear seemed to be a stranger to his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>He never hesitated to meet, nor did he wait for <quote>responsibility,</quote> but went in quest of it. To denounce meanness and villany in any and all forms, when it came in his way, was, with him, a matter of duty from which he <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> never shrunk; and so to denounce it as to bring himself in direct collision with the perpetrator or perpetrators&mdash;for he took them in crowds as well as singly&mdash;was a task for which he was instant, in season or out of season.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Even in the vices of <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00024.00317" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> there were magnificence and brilliancy imposing in a high degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>When he treated it was a mass entertainment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion he chartered a theatre for the special gratification of his friends&mdash;the public generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>He bet <num value="1000">thousands</num> on a turn of a card, and witnessed the success or failure of the wager with the nonchalance of a Mexican monte player; or, as was most usual, with the light humor of a Spanish muleteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>He broke a faro bank by the nerve with which he laid his large bets, and by exciting the passion of the veteran dealer, or awed him into honesty by the glance of his strong and steady eye.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> Attachment to his friends was a passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It was a part of the loyalty to the honorable and chivalric, which formed the subsoil of his strange and wayward nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>He never deserted a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>His confidence knew no bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It scorned all restraints and considerations of prudence or policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>He made his friends' quarrels his own, and was as guardful of their reputations as of his own. He would put his name on the back of their paper without looking at the face of it, and gave his <hi rend="italics">carte blanche</hi>, if needed, by the quire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>He was above the littleness of jealousy or rivalry, and his love of truth, his fidelity and frankness were formed on the antique models of the chevaliers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>But in social qualities he knew no rival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>These made him the delight of every circle; they were adapted to all, and were exercised on all. The same histrionic and dramatic talent that gave to his oratory so irresistible a charm, and adapted him to all grades and sorts of people, fitted him, in conversation, to delight all men. He never staled and never flagged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Even if the fund of acquired capital could have run out, his originality was such that his supply from the perennial fountain within was inexhaustible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> His humor was as various as profound&mdash;from the most delicate wit to the broadest farce, from irony to caricature, from classical illusion to the verge&mdash;and sometimes beyond the verge&mdash;of coarse jest and <persName n="Falstaff,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00024.00318" reg="mostcommon:Falstaff,nomatch:0"><surname>Falstaff</surname></persName> extravagance, and no <num value="1">one</num> knew in which department he most excelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>His animal spirits flowed over, like an artesian well, ever gushing out in a deep, bright, and sparkling current.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> He never seemed to despond or droop for a moment; the cares and anxieties of life were mere bagatelles to him. Sent to jail for fighting in the courthouse, he made the walls of the prison resound <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> with unaccustomed shouts of merriment and revelry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Starting to fight a duel, he laid down his hand at poker, to resume it with a smile when he returned, and went on the field laughing with his friends as to a picnic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Yet no <num value="1">one</num> knew better the proprieties of life than himself&mdash;when to put off levity, and treat grave subjects and persons with proper respect, and no <num value="1">one</num> could assume more gracefully a dignified and sober demeanor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> His early reading and education had been extensive and deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Probably no man of his age, in the <rs>State</rs>, was so well read in the ancient and modern classics, in the current literature of the day, and &mdash;what may seem stranger&mdash;in the sacred scriptures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>His speeches drew some of their grandest images, strongest expressions, and aptest illustrations from the inspired writings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The personnel of this remarkable man was well calculated to rivet the interest his character inspired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Though he was low of stature, and deformed in <num value="1">one</num> leg, his frame was uncommonly athletic and muscular; his arms and chest were well formed, the latter deep and broad; his head large, and a model of classical proportions and noble contour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>A handsome face, compact brow, massive and expanded, and eyes of dark hazel, full and clear, were fitted for the expression of every passion and flitting shade of feeling and sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>His complexion partook of the bilious, rather than the sanguine temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>His skin was smooth and bloodless &mdash; no excitement or stimulus heightened his color: nor did the writer ever see any evidence in his face of irregularity of habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>In repose his countenance was serious and rather melancholy-certainly somewhat soft and quiet in expression, but evidencing strength and power, and masculine rather than the light and flexible qualities which characterized him in his convivial moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>There was nothing affected or theatrical in his manner, though some parts of his printed speeches would seem to indicate this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>He was frank and artless as a child, and nothing could have been more winning than his familiar intercourse with the bar, with whom he was always a favorite, and without a rival in its affection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>I come now to speak of him as a lawyer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>He was more widely known as a politician than a lawyer, as an advocate than a jurist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>This was because politics form a wider and more conspicuous theatre than the bar, and because the mass of men are better judges of oratory than of law. That he was a man of wonderful versatility and varied accomplishments is most true, and that he was a popular orator of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class is also true, and that <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> all of his faculties did not often, if ever, find employment in his profession may be true likewise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>So far he appeared to better advantage in a deliberative assembly or before the people, because there he had a wider range and subjects of a more general interest, and was not fettered by rules and precedents; his genius expanded over a larger area, and exercised his powers in a greater variety and number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Moreover a stump speech is rarely made chiefly for conviction and persuasion, but to gratify and delight the auditors and to raise the character of the speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Imagery, anecdote, ornament, eloquence and elocution are in better taste than in a speech at the bar, where the chief and only legitimate aim is to convince and instruct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It will always be a mooted point among <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00026.00319" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>' admirers as to where his strength chiefly lay. My own opinion is that it was as a jurist that mostly excelled; that it consisted in knowing and being able to show to others what was the law. I state the opinion with some diffidence, and, did it rest on my judgment alone, should not hazard it at all. But the eminent <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> of the <orgName n="Errors High Court" type="court">high court of errors</orgName> and appeals of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> thought that <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00026.00320" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> appeared to most advantage before that court, and a distinguished judge of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></orgName>, who had heard him before the chancellor of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, expressed to me the opinion that his talents shone most conspicuously in that forum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>These were men who could be led from a fair judgment of a legal argument by mere oratory, about as readily as old <persName n="Playfair,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00026.00321" reg="mostcommon:Playfair,nomatch:0"><surname>Playfair</surname></persName> could be turned from a true criticism upon a mathematical treatise by its being burnished over with extracts from <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> harangues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Had brilliant declamation been his only or chief faculty, there were plenty of his competitors at the bar who, by their learning and powers of argument, would have knocked the spangles off of him and sent his cases whirling out of court, to the astonishment of hapless clients who had trusted to such fragile help in the time of trial.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> It may be asked how is this possible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>How is it consistent with the jealous demands which the law makes of the ceaseless and persevering attention of her followers as a condition of her favors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The question needs an answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It is to be found somewhere else than in the unaided resources of even such an intellect as that of <persName n="Prentiss,Sergeant,,,," id="n0283.0003.00026.00322" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>In some form or other, <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00026.00323" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> always was a student.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Probably the most largely developed of all his faculties was his memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>He gathered information with marvelous rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The sun stroke that makes its impression upon the medicated plate is not more rapid in transcribing, or more faithful in fixing its image than <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> was his perception in taking cognizance of the principles, or his ability to retain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Once fixed, the impression was there forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It is true, as <persName n="Wirt,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00027.00324" reg="mostcommon:Wirt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wirt</surname></persName> observed, that genius must have materials to work on. No man, how magnificently soever endowed, can possibly be a safe, much less a great, lawyer, who does not understand the facts and law of his case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>But some men may understand them much more readily than others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>There are labor-saving minds, as well as labor-saving machines, and that of <persName n="Prentiss,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00027.00325" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>In youth he had devoted himself with intense application to legal studies, and had mastered, as few men have done, the elements of the law, and much of its text-book learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>So acute and retentive an observer must, too&mdash;especially in the freshness and novelty of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> years of practice&mdash; <quote>have absorbed</quote> no little law as it floated through the courthouse, or was distilled from the bench and bar.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> But more especially it should be noted that <persName n="Prentiss,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00027.00326" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>, until the fruition of his fame, was a laborious man, even in the tapestring sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>While the world was spreading the wild tales of his youth, his deviations, though conspicuous enough while they lasted, were only occasional, and at long intervals, the intervening time being occupied in abstemious application to his studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Doubtless, too, the supposed obstacles in the way of his success, were greatly exaggerated, the vulgar having a great proneness to magnify the frailties of great men, and to lionize genius by making it independent for its splendid achievements of all external aids.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> In the examination of witnesses he was thought particularly to excel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>He wasted no time by irrelevant questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>He seemed to weigh every question before he put it, and see clearly its bearing upon every part of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The facts were brought out in natural and simple order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>He examined as few witnesses and elicited as few facts as he could safely get along with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>In this way he avoided the danger of discrepancy, and kept his mind undiverted from the controlling points of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The jury were left unwearied and unconfused, and saw, before the argument, the bearing of the testimony.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>He avoided, too, the miserable error into which so many lawyers fall of making every possible point of a case, and pressing all with equal force and confidence, thereby prejudicing the mind of the court and making the jury believe that the trial of a cause is but running a jockey race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> In arguing a cause of much public interest, he got all the benefit of the sympathy and feeling of the bystanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>He would sometimes <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> turn towards them in an impassional appeal, as if looking for a larger audience than court and jury; and the excitement of the outsiders, especially in criminal cases, was thrown with great effect into the jury box.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/><persName n="Prentiss,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00028.00327" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> was never thrown off his guard or seemingly taken by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>He kept his temper, or if he got furious, there was <quote>method in his madness.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>With these allowances, however, truth requires the admission that <persName n="Prentiss,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00028.00328" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> did, when at the seat of government, occupy the hours usually allotted by the diligent practitioner to books or clients in amusements not well suited to prepare him for those great efforts which have indissolubly associated his name with the judicial history of the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>As an advocate, <persName n="Prentiss,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00028.00329" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> attained a wider celebrity than as a jurist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Indeed, he was more formidable in this than in any other department of his profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Before the <rs>Supreme</rs>, or Chancery, or <orgName n="Circuit Court" type="court">Circuit Court</orgName>, upon the law of the case, inferior abilities might set off, against greater native powers, superior application and research; or the precedents might overpower him; or the learning or judgment of the bench might come in aid of the right, even when more feebly defended than assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>But what protection had mediocrity, or even <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-rate talent, against the influences of excitement and fascination let loose upon a mercurial jury, at least as easily impressed through their passions as their reason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The boldness of his attacks, his iron nerve, his adroitness, his power of debate, the overpowering fire&mdash;broadside after broadside&mdash;which he poured into the assailable points of his adversary, his facility and plainness of illustration, and his talent of adapting himself to every mind and character he addressed, rendered him on all debatable issues next to irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>To give him the conclusion was nearly the same thing as to give the verdict.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> He had a faculty in speaking I never knew possessed by any other person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>He seemed to speak without any effort of the will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>There seemed to be no governing or guiding power to the particular faculty called into exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It worked on, and its treasures flowed spontaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>There was no air of thought, no elevation, frowning or knitting of the brow, no fixing up of the countenance, no pauses to collect or arrange his thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>All seemed natural and unpremeditated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>No <num value="1">one</num> felt uneasy lest he should fail; in his most brilliant flights, the <q direct="unspecified">empyrean heights</q> into which he soared seemed to be his natural element, as the upper air the eagle's. <pb id="p.29" n="29"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Among the most powerful of his jury efforts were his speeches against <persName n="Bird,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00330" reg="mostcommon:Bird,nomatch:0"><surname>Bird</surname></persName> for the murder of <persName n="Cameron,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00331" reg="mostcommon:Cameron,Simon,,,:1"><surname>Cameron</surname></persName>, and against <persName n="Phelps,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00332" reg="mostcommon:Phelps,nomatch:0"><surname>Phelps</surname></persName>, the notorious highway robber and murderer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Both were convicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The former owed his conviction, as <persName n="Foote,General,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00333" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName>, who defended him with great zeal and ability thought, to the transcendent eloquence of <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00334" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>He was justly convicted, however, as his confession, afterwards made, proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/><persName n="Phelps,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00335" reg="mostcommon:Phelps,nomatch:0"><surname>Phelps</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the most daring and desperate of ruffians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>He confronted his prosecutor and the court, not only with composure, but with scornful and malignant defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>When <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00336" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> rose to speak, and for some time afterwards, the criminal scowled upon him a look of hate and insolence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>But when the orator, kindling with his subject, turned upon him and poured down a stream of burning invective, like lava, upon his head; when he depicted the villainy and barbarity of his atrocities; when he pictured in dark and dismal colors the fate which awaited him, and the awful judgment to be pronounced at another bar upon his crimes, when he should be confronted with his innocent victims; when he fixed his gaze of concentrated power upon him, the strong man's face relaxed, his eyes faltered and fell, until at length, unable to bear up any longer, self-convicted, he hid his head beneath the bar, and exhibited a picture of ruffian audacity cowed beneath the spell of true courage and triumphant genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Though convicted, he was not hung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>He broke jail and resisted recapture so desperately that, although he was encumbered with his fetters, his pursuers had to kill him in self-defense, or permit his escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/> In his defense of criminals, in that large class of cases in which something of elevation or bravery in some sort redeemed the lawlessness of the act, where murder was committed under a sense of outrage, or upon sudden resentment, and in a fair combat, his chivalrous spirit upheld the public sentiment, which, if it did not justify that sort of <quote>wild justice,</quote> could not be brought to punish it ignominiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>His appeals fell like flames on those <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>I have never heard of but <num value="1">one</num> client of his who was convicted on the charge of homicide, and he was convicted of <num value="1">one</num> of its lesser degrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>So successful was he that the expression&mdash; <quote><persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00337" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> couldn't clear him,</quote> was a hyperbole that expressed the desperation of a criminal's fortunes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> <persName n="Prentiss,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00029.00338" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> was employed only in important cases, and generally <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> as associate counsel, and was thereby relieved of much of the preliminary preparation which occupies so much of the time of an attorney in getting a case ready for trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>In the <rs type="place">Supreme</rs> and <placeName reg="Chancery court">Chancery Courts</placeName>, he had, of course, only to examine the record and prepare his argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>On the circuit his labors were much more arduous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The important criminal and civil causes which he argued necessarily required consultations with clients, the preparations of pleadings and proofs, either under his supervision, or by his advice and direction, and this, from the number and difficulty of the cases, must have consumed time and required application and industry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>At the time of which I speak his long vigils and continued excitement, did not enfeeble his energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Indeed, he has been known to assert that he felt brighter and in better preparation for forensic debate after sitting up all night in company with his friends than at any other time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>He required less sleep, probably, than any man in the <rs>State</rs>, seldom devoting to that purpose more than <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> in the <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>After his friends had retired at a late hour in the night, or rather at an early hour in the morning, he has been known to get his books and papers and prepare for the business of the day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/> His faculty of concentration drew his energies as through a lens, upon the subject before him. No matter what he was engaged in, his intellect was ceaseless in play and motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Alike comprehensive and systematic in the arrangement of his thoughts, he reproduced without difficulty what he had once conceived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/> Probably something would have still been wanting to explain his celerity of preparation for his causes, had not partial nature gifted him with the lawyer's highest talent, the acumen which, like instinct, enabled him to see the points which the record presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>His genius for generalizing saved him, in a moment, the labor of long and tedious reflection upon and collection of the several parts of a narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>He read with great rapidity; glancing his eyes through a page he caught the substance of its contents at a view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>His analysis too, was powerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>The chemist does not reduce the contents of his alembic to their elements more rapidly or surely than he resolved the most complicated facts into primary principles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/> His statements&mdash;like those of all great lawyers&mdash;were clear, conspicuous and compact; the language simple and sententious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Considered in the most technical sense, as forensic arguments merely, no <num value="1">one</num> will deny that his speeches were admirable and able efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>If the professional reader will turn to the meagre reports of his arguments <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> on the cases of <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ross</foreName> <genName>v</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>At last it was agreed to examine into the case the night before the day set for the hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>At the appointed time <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00031.00342" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> could not be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> M&mdash;&mdash; was in great perplexity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The case was of great importance; there were able opposing counsel, and his client and himself had trusted greatly to <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> P.'s assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/><persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00031.00343" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> appeared in the court-room when the case was called up. The junior counsel opened the case, reading slowly from the record all that was necessary to give a clear perception of its merits, and made the points and read the authorities he had collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>The counsel on the other side replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> P. rose to rejoin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>The junior could scarcely conceal his apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>But there was no cloud on the brow of the speaker; the consciousness of his power and approaching victory sat on his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>He commenced, as he always did, by stating clearly the case and the questions raised by the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>He proceeded to establish the propositions he contended for, by their reason, by authorities and collateral analogies, and to illustrate them from his copious resources of comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>He took up, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, the arguments of the other side, and showed their fallacy; he examined the authorities relied upon in the order in which they were introduced, and showed their inapplicability and the distinction between the facts of the cases reported and those in the case at bar. Then, returning to the authorities of his colleague, he showed how clearly, in application and principle, they supported his own argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>When he had sat down his colleague declared that <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00031.00344" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> had taught him more of the case than he had gathered from his own researches and reflection.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>He was admitted to the bar of the <rs type="place">House</rs> to defend and assert his right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>He then delivered that speech which took the <rs type="place">House</rs> and the country by storm; an effort, which, if his fame rested upon it alone, for its manliness of tone, exquisite satire, gorgeous imagery and argumentative power, would have rendered his name imperishable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The <rs type="place">House</rs>, opposed to him as it was in political sentiment, reversed its former judgment, which declared <persName n="Gholson,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00032.00349" reg="mostcommon:Gholson,nomatch:0"><surname>Gholson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Claiborne,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00032.00350" reg="mostcommon:Claiborne,nomatch:0"><surname>Claiborne</surname></persName> entitled to their seats, and divided equally on the question of admitting <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00032.00351" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> and Word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The applause which greeted him at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and which attended the speeches he was called upon to make in the north, came thundering back to his adopted State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>His friends, and their name was legion, thought before that his talents were of the highest order, and when their judgments were thus confirmed&mdash;when they received the endorsements of such men as <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00032.00353" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Henry,,,:3"><surname>Clay</surname></persName>, <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00032.00354" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> and <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00032.00355" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,James,,,:1"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, they felt a kind of personal interest in him; he was their <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00032.00356" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Their excitement knew no bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Political considerations, too, doubtless had their weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The canvass opened&mdash;it was less a canvass than an ovation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>He went through the <rs>State</rs>, a herculean task, making speeches every day, except <date value="--7">Sundays</date>, in the sultry months of <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The people of all classes and both sexes turned out to hear him: He came, as he declared, less on his own errand than theirs, to vindicate a violated constitution, to rebuke the insult to the honor and sovereignty of the <rs>State</rs>, to uphold the sacred right of the people to elect their own rulers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The theme was worthy of the orator, the orator of the subject.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>This period may be considered the golden prime of the genius of <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00032.00357" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>His real effective greatness here attained its culminating point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>He had the whole State for his audience, the honor of the <rs>State</rs> for his subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>He came well armed and well equipped for the warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Not content with challenging his competitors to the <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> field, he threw down the gauntlet to all comers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Party or ambition, or some other motive, constrained several gentlemen&mdash;famous before, notorious afterwards&mdash;to meet him. In every instance of such temerity, the opposer was made to bite the dust.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>The ladies surrounded the rostrum with their carriages, and added by their beauty, interest to the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>There was no element or oratory that his genius did not supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>It was plain to see where his boyhood had drawn its romantic inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>His imagination was colored and imbued with the light of the shadowy past, and was richly stored with the unreal but life-like creations which the genius of <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00358" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName> and <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00359" reg="mostcommon:Scott,W.,B.,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> had evoked from the ideal world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>He had lingered spellbound, among the scenes of mediaeval chivalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>His spirit had dwelt, until almost naturalized, in the mystic dreamland they peopled&mdash;among paladins and crusaders and Knights <persName n="Templar,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00360" reg="mostcommon:Templar,nomatch:0"><surname>Templar</surname></persName>; with <placeName reg="Monmouth, Warren, Illinois" key="tgn,2029131">Monmouth</placeName> and <persName n="Percy,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00361" reg="nearbymention:Percy,Harry,,,"><surname>Percy</surname></persName>&mdash;with <persName n="Bois,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00362" reg="mostcommon:Bois,nomatch:0"><surname>Bois</surname></persName>-<persName n="Gilbert,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00363" reg="mostcommon:Gilbert,nomatch:0"><surname>Gilbert</surname></persName> and Ivanhoe, and the bold <rs>McGregor</rs>&mdash;&mdash;with the cavaliers of <persName><foreName>Rupert</foreName></persName>, and the iron enthusiasts of <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00364" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>The fluency of his speech was unbroken&mdash;no syllable unpronounced&mdash;not a ripple on the smooth and brilliant tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Probably he never hesitated for a word in his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>His diction adapted itself without effort to the thought; now easy and familiar, now stately and dignified, now beautiful and varied as the hues of the rainbow; again compact, even rugged in sinewy strength, or lofty and grand in eloquent declamation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/> His face and manner were alike uncommon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>The turn of his head was like <persName n="Byron,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00366" reg="mostcommon:Byron,nomatch:0"><surname>Byron</surname></persName>'s; the face and the action were just what the mind made them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The excitement of the features, the motions of the head and body, the gesticulation he used, were all in absolute harmony with the words you heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>You saw and took cognizance of the general effect only; the particular instrumentalities did not strike you; they certainly did not call off attention to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>How a countenance so redolent of good humor as his, at times, could so soon be overcast, and express such intense bitterness, seemed a marvel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>But bitterness and angry passions were probably, as strongly implanted in him as any other sentiments or qualities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>There was much about him to remind you of <persName n="Byron,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00033.00367" reg="mostcommon:Byron,nomatch:0"><surname>Byron</surname></persName>&mdash;the cast of the head, the classic features, the fiery and restive nature, the moral and personal daring, the imaginative and poetical temperament, the scorn and deep passion, the deformity of which I have spoken, the <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> satiric wit, the craving for excitement, and the air of melancholy he sometimes wore, his early neglect, and the imagined slights put upon him in his unfriendly youth, the collisions, mental and physical, which he had with others, his brilliant and sudden reputation, and the romantic interest which invested him, make up a list of correspondences, still further increased, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>by his untimely death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>With such abilities as we have alluded to, and surrounded by such circumstances, he prosecuted the canvass, making himself the equal favorite of all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Old Democrats were seen with tears running down their cheeks, laughing hysterically, and some, who, ever since the formation of the parties, had voted the <rs>Democratic</rs> ticket from coroner up to governor, threw up their hats and shouted for him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>After his return from Congress, <persName n="Prentiss,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00034.00369" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> continued to devote himself to his profession, but subsequently to <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct>, he was more engaged in closing up his old business than in prosecuting new. Some year or <num value="2">two</num> afterwards the suit which involved his fortune was determined against him in the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, and he found himself by this event, aggravated as it was by his immense liabilities for others, deprived of the accumulations of years of successful practice, and again dependent upon his own exertions for the support of himself and others now placed under his protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>In the meantime the profession in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> had become less remunerative and more laborious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Bearing up with an unbroken spirit against adverse fortune, he determined to try a new theatre, where his talents might have larger scope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>For this purpose he removed to the city of <placeName reg="New Orleans, Orleans, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014214">New Orleans</placeName>, and was admitted to the bar there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>How rapidly he rose to a position among the leaders of that bar, and how near he seemed to be to its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> honors, the country knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>The energy with which he addressed himself to the task of mastering the peculiar jurisprudence of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, and the success with which his efforts were crowned are not the least of the splendid achievements of this distinguished gentleman.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>The danger is not that we shall be misconstrued in regard to the rude sketch we have given of <persName n="Prentiss,Mister,,,," id="n0283.0003.00034.00370" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> in any such matter as to leave the impression that we are prejudiced against, or have underrated the character of, that gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>We are conscious of having <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> written in no unkind or unloving spirit of <num value="1">one</num> whom, in life, we honored, and whose memory is still dear to us; the danger is elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>It is <num value="2">two</num>-fold: that we may be supposed to have assigned to <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00371" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> a higher order of abilities than he possessed; and, in the second place, that we have presented for undistinguishing admiration, a character, some of the elements of which do not deserve to be admired or imitated&mdash;and, indeed, which are of most perilous example, especially to warm-blooded youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>As to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objection, we feel sure that we are not mistaken, and even did we distrust our own judgment, we would be confirmed by <persName n="Sharkey,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00372" reg="mostcommon:Sharkey,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharkey</surname></persName>, <persName n="Boyd,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00373" reg="mostcommon:Boyd,Belle,,,:2"><surname>Boyd</surname></persName>, <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00374" reg="mostcommon:Williamson,nomatch:0"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Guion,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00375" reg="mostcommon:Guion,nomatch:0"><surname>Guion</surname></persName>, <persName n="Quitman,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00376" reg="mostcommon:Quitman,nomatch:0"><surname>Quitman</surname></persName>, to say nothing of the commendations of <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00377" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Henry,,,:3"><surname>Clay</surname></persName>, <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00378" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> and <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00379" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,James,,,:1"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">the immortal <num value="3">three</num>,</q> whose opinions as to <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00380" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>' talents would be considered extravagant if they did not carry with them the imprimatur of their own great names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>But we confess to the danger implied in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>With all our admiration for Prentiss-much as his memory is endeared to us, however, the faults of his character and the irregularities of his life may be palliated by the peculiar circumstances which pressed upon idiosyncracies of his temper and mind almost as peculiar as those circumstances&mdash;it cannot be denied, and it ought not to be concealed, that the influence of <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00381" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> upon men, especially upon the young men of his time and association, was hurtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>True, he had some attributes worthy of unlimited admiration, and he did some things which the best men might take as examples for imitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>He was a noble, whole-souled, magnanimous man, as pure of honor, as lofty in chivalric bearing as the heroes of romance; but, mixed with these brilliant qualities were vices of mind and habit, which those fascinating graces rendered doubly dangerous, for vice is more easily copied than virtue, and in the partnership between virtue and vice, vice subsidizes virtue to its uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/><persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00035.00382" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> lacked regular, self-denying, systematic application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>He accomplished a great deal, but not a great deal for his capital; if he did more than most men, he did less than the task of such a man; if he gathered much, he wasted and scattered more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>He wanted the great essential of a true, genuine, moral greatness; these were not above his intellect&mdash;above his strong array of strong powers and glittering faculties&mdash;above the fierce hosts of passion in his soul&mdash;a presiding spirit of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Life was no trust to him; it was a thing to be enjoyed&mdash;a bright holiday season, a gala day, to be spent freely and carelessly, a gift to be decked out with brilliant deeds and eloquent words and all the gewgaws of fancy, and to be laid down bravely when the evening star should succeed the <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> bright sun, and the dews begin to fall softly upon the green earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>True, he labored more than most men, but he labored as he frolicked, because his mind could not be idle, but burst into work as by the irrepressible instinct with which he sought occupation as an outlet to intellectual excitement, but what he accomplished was nothing to the measure of his powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>He studied more than he seemed to study, more, probably, than he cared to have it believed he studied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>But he could accomplish with only slender effort the end for which less gifted men must delve and toil and slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>But the imitators, the many youths of warm passions and high hopes, ambitious of distinction, yet solicitous of pleasure, blinded by the glare of <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00036.00383" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>' eloquence, the corruscations of a wit and fancy through which his speeches were borne as a stately ship through the phosphorescent waves of a tropical sea&mdash;what example was it to them to see the renown of the forum, the eloquence of the hustings, the triumphs of the senate associated with the faro table, the midnight revel, the drunken carouse, the loose talk of the board laden with wine and cards?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>What <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00036.00384" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> effected they failed in compassing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>Like a chamois hunter full of life and vigor and courage, supported by the spear of his genius&mdash;potent as Ithuriel's&mdash;Prentiss sprang up the steeps and leaped over the chasms on his way to the mount where the <quote>proud temple</quote> shines above cloud and storm, but mediocrity, in essaying to follow him, but made ridiculous the enterprise which only such a man with such aids could accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>And even he, not wisely or well; the penalty came at last, as it must ever come for a violation of natural or moral laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>He lived in pain and poverty, drooping in spirit, exhausted in mind and body, to lament that wasting of life and health and genius, which, unwasted, in the heyday of existence, and in the meridian luster of his unrivaled powers, might have opened for himself and for his country a career of usefulness and just renown scarcely paralleled by the most honored and loved of all the land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/> If to squander such rare gifts were a grievous fault, grievously hath this erring child of genius answered it. But painfully making this concession, forced alone by the truth, it is with pleasure we can say, that, with this deduction from <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00036.00385" reg="nearbymention:Prentiss,S.,,,"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>' claims to reverence and honor, there yet remains so much of force and brilliancy in the character, so much that is honorable, and noble, and generous, so much of a manhood whose robust and masculine virtues are set off by the wild and lovely graces that tempered and adorned his strength, that we feel drawn to it not less to admire than to love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/><pb id="p.37" n="37"/></p> 
<p> In the midst of his budding prospects, rapidly ripening into fruition, insidious disease attacked him. It was long hoped that the close and fibrous system which had, seemingly, defied all the laws of nature, would prove superior to this malady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>His unconquerable will bore him up long against its attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>Indeed, it seemed that only death itself could subdue that fiery and unextinguishable energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>He made his last great effort, breathing in its feeble accents, but a more touching and affecting pathos and a more persuasive eloquence in behalf of <persName n="Lopez,,,,," id="n0283.0003.00037.00386" reg="mostcommon:Lopez,nomatch:0"><surname>Lopez</surname></persName>, charged with the offence of fitting out an expedition against <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>So weak was he that he was compelled to deliver in a sitting posture, and was carried, after its delivery, exhausted from the bar.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Not long after this time, in a state of complete prostration, he was taken in a steamboat from New Orleans to <placeName key="tgn,7017545" n="1.000 120" reg="natchez, adams, mississippi">Natchez</placeName>, under the care of some faithful friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The opiates given him and the exhaustion of nature had dethroned his imperial reason, and the great advocate talked wildly of some trial in which he supposed he was engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>When he reached <placeName key="tgn,7017545" n="1.000 120" reg="natchez, adams, mississippi">Natchez</placeName> he was taken to the residence of a relation, and from that time, only for a moment, did a glance of recognition fall, lighting up for an instant his pallid features, upon his wife and children weeping around his bed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>What he might have been, after a mature age and a riper wisdom we cannot tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>But that he was capable of commanding the loftiest heights of fame, and marking his name and character upon the age he lived in we verily believe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/> But he has gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>He died, and lies buried near that noble river which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, when a raw <name>Yankee</name> boy, caught his poetic eye, and stirred by its aspect of grandeur his sublime imagination; upon whose shores <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fell his burning and impassioned words as they aroused the rapturous applause of his astonished auditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>And long will that noble river flow out its tide into the gulf ere the roar of its current shall mingle with the tones of such eloquence again&mdash;eloquence as full and majestic, as resistless and sublime, and as wild in its sweep as its own sea-like flood&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="GA18">18th Georgia</orgName> suffered not at all, as they lay in a slight depression of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>I do not think I had a man hurt by artillery during the engagement</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Covered by his artillery the enemy moved up his infantry in <num value="3">three</num> lines of battle, preceded by skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>As soon as our own skirmishers had retired, they were received with a general discharge from our whole line, which speedily threw their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line into confusion, killing and wounding considerable numbers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Unable to face our fire, that line fell back in disorder, which, as I was afterwards told, they communicated to their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Such was the eagerness of <persName n="Stiles,Major,,,," id="n0283.0004.00040.00403" reg="nearbymention:Stiles,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Stiles</surname></persName>' men, that upon perceiving the enemy's hesitation, they sprang up from their recumbent attitude and rushed upon them, fixing bayonets as they advanced; and it was with difficulty that <persName n="Stiles,Major,,,," id="n0283.0004.00040.00404" reg="nearbymention:Stiles,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Stiles</surname></persName> and I could check them and restore the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>I was also afterwards informed, by other officers of the brigade that the enemy's <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line was broken in a similar manner by our fire, and that his <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> line was met by ours in a general advance with the bayonet, and driven back beyond the creek, when the flag of truce appeared announcing the surrender of the whole corps by <persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n0283.0004.00040.00405" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>I communicate information received from others of what did not fall under my own observation, for the sake of the corroboration it may give to statements from other quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>After the restoration of our line, broken, as just stated, by the precipitate charge of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Stiles,Major,,,," id="n0283.0004.00040.00406" reg="nearbymention:Stiles,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Stiles</surname></persName>' command</orgName>, my attention was confined to what took place on our extreme right, and I saw no more of the general engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>And if I go on to recount too minutely what may be considered <num value="1">one</num> of the minor events of the field, I trust it may be pardoned as a just tribute to the splendid courage and unfaltering devotion to the cause of their country of my brave battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>No words of mine seem <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> adequate to praise them as they deserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>But while I have an opportunity to speak, the living must not lose, through my silence, their claim to the gratitude of their country, nor the dead that honorable mention which belongs to the soldier who falls in a righteous cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>I have before stated that my battalion was on the extreme right of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Its right rested on the road by which we had marched after crossing the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>On the other side of the road was a dense pine thicket, which concealed all beyond from view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Perhaps you will recollect passing the command early in the engagement, and telling me I might feel secure about my flank, as <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0283.0004.00041.00407" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName> was beyond the thicket; as I understood matters, with his extreme left covering our flank, his line being at right angles to ours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>After re-establishing <orgName n="Battalion"><persName n="Stiles,Major,,,," id="n0283.0004.00041.00408" reg="nearbymention:Stiles,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Stiles</surname></persName>' Battalion</orgName>, I passed up to our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>I had scarcely got there, when I perceived a large body of the enemy advancing through the thicket diagonally upon our flank, and already within about <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure>. They could not have been seen at a greater distance, so close were the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>I had but <num value="85">eighty-five</num> men, but I could not leave the spot, nor was there a moment to spare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>I changed front instantly (receiving, as the movement was made, a volley which proved fatal to several), and took position in a wide and shallow gully at the road-side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Perceiving that the superior numbers of the enemy would enable him to destroy us by his fire, I ordered bayonets fixed and attacked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Through the extraordinary gallantry of the men, the attack was entirely successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Many of the enemy were killed with the bayonet, and the rest were driven off in disorder, after a desperate struggle, distinguished by many acts of individual heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/><persName n="Turner,Lieutenant,G.,M.,," id="n0283.0004.00041.00409" reg="expanded:Turner,George,M.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>, though previously wounded on the skirmish line, joined in the charge, and was shot down in the act of saving the life of a comrade.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>I hope I did not commit an error in taking this course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>The safety of the brigade was at stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>If my brave fellows had flinched or given way, the enemy would have thrown himself on our flank, and the general loss must have been much greater than it was.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>I had scarcely reassembled the remnant of the battalion in its original position, with but <num value="1">one</num> officer unwounded besides myself, when you passed by and reassured me as to my apprehensions of further molestation from that quarter by the information that other troops had been sent to guard that approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>They probably never reached their destination; for in a very few minutes another but smaller body of the enemy came on over the same ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Supposing them to be some of our own troops giving way, I took my men out to rally them and discovered that they were enemies only when within a few paces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>I attempted, as our only recourse, to repeat the attack which has just terminated so well; but overpowered by superior numbers, though fighting to the last, all the rest of the command were killed, wounded or taken.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>Seeing then but <num value="1">one</num> officer and the non-commissioned staff remaining, I displayed my handkerchief in token of surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>As I did so, the enemy, hitherto sheltering themselves behind the trees, rushed into the road, and fired upon my wounded who lay in the gully before mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It was with the greatest difficulty they could be induced to cease from this barbarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>I mention this closing incident as <num value="1">one</num> more of the numerous atrocities which indicated the relentless spirit in which the war was waged against us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The loss in the <orgName type="regiment" key="18GABattalion">18th Georgia Battalion</orgName> was <measure n="30" type="killed">thirty killed</measure>, including those who subsequently died of their wounds, and <measure n="22" type="wounded">twenty-two wounded</measure>; in all <num value="0.61">sixty-one per cent.</num> of the number engaged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>I do not know of any attempt to estimate the loss in the rest of the brigade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Having subsequently re-visited the field and passed some days in its immediate vicinity, I was informed by <num value="1">one</num> of the neighboring residents that the troops encountered by my battalion were <orgName n="Brigade"><persName n="Hamblin,,,,," id="n0283.0004.00042.00419" reg="mostcommon:Hamblin,nomatch:0"><surname>Hamblin</surname></persName>'s Brigade</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 6">6th Corps</orgName>, consisting of <num value="3">three</num> regiments, of which <num value="0.5">one-half</num> were ordered forward at each time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/><pb id="p.43" n="43"/></p> 
<p>The information was obtained from <persName n="Hamblin,General,,,," id="n0283.0004.00043.00420" reg="mostcommon:Hamblin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hamblin</surname></persName> himself, who further admitted that he suffered very severely and lost <num value="6">six</num> colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>As I heard of but <num value="2">two</num> regimental flags, I presume the others were markers' flags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Indeed, <num value="1">one</num> of my men told me that he saw <persName n="King,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0283.0004.00043.00421" reg="nearbymention:King,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>King</surname></persName>, whose death is above-mentioned, with <measure n="2bmark" type="currency"><num value="2">two</num> mark</measure>ers' flags shortly before he fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>It seems scarcely possible that this battalion could have contended successfully with even a single regiment unless reduced to its own feeble dimensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>It can be explained, however, by the fact that they were thrown into some disorder by the closeness of the thicket through which they advanced, and being thus caught in detail by a sudden attack had no opportunity to recover themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>I have thus, General, given an account, perhaps too detailed, of the fortunes of the brigade from the evacuation to its capture, in what fell under my own observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>If anything is omitted which was stated in my former communication in unofficial form, I beg you will make the necessary corrections and additions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>I have been more minute than would have been necessary or, perhaps, even proper, under other circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>But I feel with you that since they have lost all else, we ought to save for our brave soldiers all the honors they so hardly won. All their toils and sufferings and dangers have been apparently in vain; but they fought in a just cause, and if they did not achieve success they at least deserved it. I await with impatience the day when the world will do justice to our country and our countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Here he stands out conspicuously in his devotion to principle and duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>He was no time-server.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>He did not trim his sails to catch the popular breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>He had the courage of his convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>In the second place they were calm, cool-headed men, and conservative in their ideas and views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>In the third place they were men of high character, wide experience and more than average ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>They loved <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>She was their native State and was as dear to them as the apple of the eye. Around and about her were centered their affections and interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>They well knew that their own fate was united and interwoven with the destiny of their beloved commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>They knew <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> too that it was suicidal to attempt to stem the public current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>To face the issue to brave public opinion would cost them much in political and possibly in social life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>But they loved the <rs>Union</rs> and loved it with the supremest affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>From early childhood they had learned to sing its praises, to study the lives and emulate the example of its long line of illustrious men, and no less distinguished women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>To point with pride to its star spangled banner, its battlefields and long list of heroes and heroines, and with an enthusiastic ardor which knew no bounds to proclaim its greatness and boast of its grand and glorious past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>And yet they were devoted to their State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>To them secession was not simply a bitter pill, it was a grievous mistake and a national calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Grave, earnest, serious, sad men were these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>They turned their faces skyward and read in the stars gloomy auguries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>They came before the people and foretold war, ruin and desolation, and only too true did their prophecies prove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>And they asked the people over and over again the question, why secede?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>What cause for separation exists?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Having done the best they could to stem the tide, but in vain, they quietly and sadly determined to share the fate of their people whatever that fate might be.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>To the credit of Carolinians be it said they honored and respected these noble old men to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>That was usually his fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>But under all circumstances throughout his life, though generally on the minority, he boldly avowed his views and had at least the consciousness of knowing that he had his own self-respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>And as I have already said, he commanded the respect of his people to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>He was appointed to codify the laws of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>We were then moving in the direction of <placeName reg="Burkeville Junction">Burkeville Junction</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>It was a forced march, halting only to rest on our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>To add to other discomforts, a cold rain set in. Footsore, almost starved, and well-nigh exhausted, we continued the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>There being no commissary stores from which to draw, no rations had been issued since leaving the lines, and, as before stated, we started with empty haversacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/><pb id="p.141" n="141"/> The resources of the country through which we were passing had been almost exhausted, and we had to gather up and eat the grains of corn left on the ground where the horses had fed, whenever we could find any. We were, moreover, constantly annoyed by the enemy's cavalry, which hung on our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>Thus the retreat continued until the afternoon of <dateStruct value="-04-6"><day type="name">Thursday</day>, <month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="6">6th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>More than half of our men had straggled or fallen by the wayside from sheer exhaustion, but those whose endurance and grit had brought them thus far were ready to face any foe. Between <time value="2">2</time> and <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> in the afternoon of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> we arrived at <placeName reg="Sailor's Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2646522">Sailor's Creek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>The stream had been swollen by the rains of the past few days and the waters overflowed the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>We waded across this stream and took position on the rising ground about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">100 yards</measure> beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>The ground was covered with a growth of broom straw and a few small bushes, mostly pine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>Our line of battle was long drawn out-exceedingly thin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>Very soon after taking our position, the enemy opened a brisk fire on us from a battery posted on the opposite ridge, about <measure n="300yards" type="distance">300 yards</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>We had no artillery to return the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>This fire did but little damage to my immediate command, but our brigade suffered severely further to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>Their infantry then appeared in solid line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>They moved steadily forward, reached the creek which we had so recently crossed, waded through, as we had done, dressed up their line, and continued their advance towards the rising ground where our men lay. When they had advanced to within <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> paces of our line, the order was given to charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>In a moment we were on our feet, yelling like demons and rushing upon their line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>It has always been a mystery to me why they did not then and there wipe our little band from the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>It may be that the very audacity of our charge bewildered and demoralized them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>At any rate they broke and fled just before we reached them, but a portion of the line engaged in a hand-to-hand fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>We followed them to the edge of the stream, into which they plunged, our men keeping up a deadly fire on them as they crossed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>It was during this charge that my company suffered most severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>A young cavalry officer, riding in among us, begged us to surrender, telling us that we were entirely surrounded, and that further resistance was useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>It was so gallant an act no <num value="1">one</num> attempted to molest him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>In the mean while the infantry, which had been driven across the creek, had reformed and were advancing in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>Our men then threw down their arms, and we were prisoners of war. I remember that in the hot blood of youth, I broke my sword over a sapling, rather than surrender it. When the infantry which we had so recently repulsed, came up to us again, it was with smiling faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>They commenced opening their haversacks, offering to share their <q direct="unspecified">hard tack</q> with us, which in our famished condition we most eagerly and gratefully accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>They, moreover, complimented us on the gallant fight we had made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>In this connection, I will add that we were always treated with every consideration by the veterans at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3991"/>As stated before, there were warehouses filled with provisions, stores, etc., for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3994"/>Many stragglers from the army had already reached <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>; in fact, they had been coming daily since the retreat of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0283.0030.00270.03562" reg="nearbymention:Lee,J.,W.,T.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3995"/>With the dawn of day women and children, old and young, began to pour in from the surrounding country and congregated in crowds around the warehouses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>There was a <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> of <num value="2">two</num> companies left to protect the property; they tried to stop the rising storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>The crowd only waited for a leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>Aided by the stragglers, the unresisting guards were soon swept out of the <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> way and the work of plundering began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/>A major from <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> attempted to stop it, but he was soon glad to be able to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>Soon wagons, carts, wheelbarrows and every other conceivable means of removing the coveted supplies were pressed into service; women and children staggered under loads impossible under other circumstances for them to carry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4002"/>But this scene was speedily put to an end in an unexpected and fatal manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4003"/>Near <num value="2">two</num> of the largest warehouses the <rs>Confederate</rs> <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> had stored a large amount of loaded shells and a large amount of powder.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4004"/>As I stated before, a large number of stragglers were in town, and we had been asked to send them as far as possible in the direction of <placeName reg="Greensboroa">Greensboroa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4005"/>The train was partially loaded, and nearly ready to start.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4006"/>They had broken into the powder house, and many of them were carrying off quantities of it-others still lingered around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4007"/>Many of the town boys, both <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, were securing their share of the ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4008"/>Suddenly a deafening sound was heard, shells flew through the air, and bodies of men and boys, and fragments of limbs were scattered in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4009"/>I was standing about <measure n="300yards" type="distance">300 yards</measure> from the wreck of the building, when a piece of shell weighing <measure n="6l." type="pounds"><num value="6">six</num> pounds</measure>, passed between the superintendent and myself Had it deviated <measure n="12inches" type="distance">twelve inches</measure> either way, <num value="1">one</num> of us would have been killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>We found his remains, but he was spared the agony <rs>Tom</rs> had to endure before death relieved him. The explosion was caused by a soldier dropping a match, and <num value="50">fifty</num> lives were sacrificed through that carelessness.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4223"/>The members of the company needed rest; they desired a relaxation from the long marches and severe struggles so recently undergone; but orders issued during war are inexorable; so to the work the men went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4224"/>Camp-fires were kindled, and rations, composed of the best of the land that could be furnished by the powers that then existed, were prepared and packed away in haversacks In a few hours all was in readiness for the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4225"/>The drivers here received orders to harness and hitch horses to the guns, the ammunition in the gun-chests and caissons was examined as to condition, etc., and a report made to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, <persName n="Clopton,Lieutenant,William,I.,," id="n0283.0035.00289.04000" reg="default:Clopton,William,I.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>I.</foreName> <surname>Clopton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4235"/>During this encampment the men learned through some source on what point this portion of the army was expected to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4236"/>It was whispered through the camp that the march was to be on to New Berne, and it was further said that the land forces were to be supported, or assisted, in the attack on the town by men in long boats on the <placeName key="tgn,1127725" n="1.000 33" reg="neuse, north carolina, united states">Neuse river</placeName>, under command of <persName n="Wood,Colonel,R.,Taylor,," id="n0283.0035.00290.04001" reg="default:Wood,R.,Taylor,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>Taylor</foreName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4237"/>These boats, it was stated, were to be equipped with all necessary appliances and the men were to be armed with cutlasses, etc., for boarding vessels, and on arriving in sight of the town, and if gunboats should be seen in the river, the men were to lay to their oars and secrete themselves as best they could under the over-hanging boughs of the trees on the banks of the stream, when they were to remain until nightfall, when a concerted move on the part of the crews of the several boats was to be made on the <rs>Federal</rs> gunboats and the latter taken, if possible, by boarding; or, finding that this would be an impossibility, they were to make the attempt to blow them up if they could do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4242"/>The forces had traveled <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> and had not obtained sight of a single man decked out in blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4243"/>On the night of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day there was a halt, orders were quietly issued that there were to be no camp-fires, and all talking must be done in a very low tone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4244"/>The guns stood in line in the middle of the road with the horses still hitched to them, and the men lay on the ground to get, if possible, a few minutes' rest; for they fully realized that they were in the enemy's country, and knew not what was in store for them on the next day, or how severe a struggle they might have to go through.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4245"/>The morning broke with a thick fog or mist hanging low, and the <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> men could not see a great distance ahead of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4246"/>A forward movement was ordered, the men again being reminded to be as quiet as was possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4247"/>Probably not more than half a mile had been traversed before another halt was ordered, the command given to unlimber the guns, and for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time was the company reminded to be very quiet in executing orders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4248"/>After the guns had been unlimbered, to the surprise of the cannoneers and the non-commissioned officers, the command was given to move the guns forward by hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4249"/>All orders were executed to the letter, but in carrying out the last command (to move the guns by hand) the distance proved very short, for the men found themselves on the crest of an incline which led down to a small stream of water, which was afterwards learned to be Bachelor's creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4250"/>After the guns had been planted, orders were given to prepare for action; the guns were loaded and their fire directed on a block-house or fort on the opposite side of the creek, the outlines of which could barely be distinguished, owing to the fog or mist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4251"/>The firing was very rapid, solid shot and canister being used, which made it very hot for the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers who held the fort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4252"/>Finding that the enemy still held on in spite of the heavy fire, and would neither vacate nor surrender, a movement was made by the <orgName n="Fayette Artillery" type="artillery">Fayette artillery</orgName> which had never been attempted before during the war, nor was it done by this company afterward, or by any other, so far as has been ever known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4253"/>A charge was made on this block-house or fort by the artillerists, they moving the guns down the incline and across the creek by hand, stopping occasionally to fire a shot at the fort and loading as they advanced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4254"/>As the company crossed the creek and secured a position within about <measure n="75feet" type="distance">seventy-five feet</measure> of the fort, and before they could fire a shot, a section of artillery was driven out and started rapidly down the road toward New Berne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4255"/>The horses of the <orgName n="Fayette Artillery" type="artillery">Fayette Artillery</orgName> were brought up, hitched to the guns as quickly as possible, and the battery started in pursuit of the enemy, which was kept up for <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> ahead of the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4256"/>During this pursuit neither party fired a shot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4257"/>The horses of the <orgName n="Fayette Artillery" type="artillery">Fayette Artillery</orgName> having to be brought from the hill where the battery <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> went into position, and the guns having to be limbered up, this and the good condition of the enemy's horses gave the <rs>Federals</rs> great advantage over the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4258"/>The flying section reached the junction of the railroad and country road running to the town several minutes ahead of the pursuers, <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> went into position, fired upon us, limbered up, and fairly flew to New Berne, the <orgName n="Fayette Artillery" type="artillery">Fayette Artillery</orgName> not having a chance to reply to their shot.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4260"/>On the right of the county road and several <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure> from the railroad the trees had been cut down, leaving stumps about knee high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4261"/>In this place, with hardly room to move a gun, the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of the artillery ordered the guns into battery, it having been learned through some source that a train was approaching loaded with troops destined for the town to reinforce the garrison.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4262"/>A few minutes after the guns had been placed in position the <orgName n="Confederate infantry" type="infantry">Confederate infantry</orgName> came up, and, moving to the right and to the left, formed a line of battle near the railroad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4263"/>The infantry had not been in battle array more than half an hour when the noise from the approaching train was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4264"/>All hands were on the <hi rend="italics">qui vive</hi>. The artillerists quickly came to their post to the guns, and patiently waited the turn of events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4265"/>The train soon came into sight, and, as it got in range of the guns firing was opened upon it, but, being protected by an embankment, no damage, so far as could be seen, was done to the cars, nor were any of the soldiers killed or wounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/>As the train thundered by, going at a rapid rate of speed, the infantry on board opened fire on the <name>Southerners</name>, and although the bullets flew thick and fast, not an artillerist or horse received a wound.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>Just at this point it may not be out of place to say that, had the officer in command (as he was requested to do) permitted <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the guns to have taken up position in the road, where a fair sweep could have been had at the moving train, it is believed by survivors of that engagement that the train would never have reached New Berne, but would have been brought to a standstill, and the train, with its load of infantry, particularly the latter, brought back as prisoners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4268"/>The section of artillery from the block-fort and the train having got safely into the town, the next move of the <rs>Confederates</rs> was to make a forward movement on that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>The guns were limbered up and the infantry brought into column, and the forward movement begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>The column moved down the county road, crossed the railroad, marched up a slight incline, reaching a level plateau.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>On the <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> left of the road was seen a small house, from which floated the yellow flag, a symbol of small-pox.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4272"/>It is needless to say a wide berth was given this place by a quick movement to the right.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>Being asked to describe it, from his description the questioner much preferred turning his face toward old <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 12" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and his back upon the town, than to be <num value="1">one</num> of the number in making the attempt to capture it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>This description was as follows: <q direct="unspecified">That around the town was a ditch <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> deep, and as many, if not more, wide; that on the approach of an enemy, this could be quickly filled with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>The breastworks, which were of the most improved kind, and running up on a line with the inside of the ditch, were mounted with heavy pieces of ordnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>Not being supplied with necessary appliances for crossing such a ditch, or scaling such a wall of sand, it was well known that, even though the breastworks might be reached, and the soldiery get into the ditch, there was not a scintilla of hope for their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>Therefore, was it wonderful that the men, on learning such a state of affairs, much preferred turning back than advancing?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/></p> 
<p>It was not known whether the old darkey told the truth or not; but, however that may be, before the <rs>Confederates</rs> could get in full view of the town, a puff of smoke was seen to rise, and ere the sound of the gun reached the ears of the soldiers a heavy shot whizzed over their heads, the same seeming to warn the boys in gray not to approach any nearer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>And they didn't either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>There was a sudden halt, and not many minutes elapsed when the command to countermarch was given, the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers retraced their steps, recrossed the railroad, and <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> went into camp among the stumps which they had left but a short while ago.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>As night approached there was a heavy guard mounted around the camp, and the men, feeling perfectly secure, wrapped themselves in their blankets, stretched themselves out on old Mother Earth, and soon fell asleep and enjoyed that which was so much needed to the body, a night of refreshing slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>The camp was aroused early the next morning, and the men being greatly refreshed from the labor and fatigue of the day before, started in to prepare their breakfast from such stores as were provided by the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">commissary department</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>And it will be noted further on, that it was something beyond the ordinary, the extraordinary, that took place, and which was not down on the programme.</p>
