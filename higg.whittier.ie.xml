<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>This bent of his mind was discouraged by his parents: they were in indigent circumstances, and unable to give him a suitable education, and they did not wish to inspire him with hopes which might never be fulfilled. ...

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Times of peace, it is said, have few historians, but times of war have still fewer, because the hotter the fight the harder it is to stop and describe it. It will be useless to attempt any full explanation, for the readers of to-day, of the great division which embittered the lives of so many among the early abolitionists, as years passed on. The strength of character which makes a leader of reform is not easily combined with the sweet attributes of the peacemaker; and after the right to agitate a great principle is fought for and won, there is apt to be a good deal of further pugilism needed in determining just how it shall be agitated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The leader of the antislavery movement was of course <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00066.00433" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,L.,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, and he had been <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00066.00434" reg="nearbymention:Whittier,Elizabeth,,,"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName>'s especial guide and source of influence in his personal career; so that their mutual relation became in time a difficult question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>After the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> had been mobbed into fame, it turned out to be in the hands of a man who had, not <num value="1">one</num> moral aim alone in view, but many; who had a whole quiver full of arrows to discharge at a dozen public evils, and would by no means be limited by any <num value="1">one</num> else in the right of selection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>This was all very proper if <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00066.00435" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,L.,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s newspaper belonged to him in fee simple; but what became of it <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> as an organ of the whole antislavery body, of which <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00067.00436" reg="nearbymention:Whittier,Elizabeth,,,"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> happened to be <num value="1">one</num>?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Then came the great question of voting or non-voting, and here <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00067.00439" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,L.,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s disunion attitude, in itself logical enough, went against <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00067.00440" reg="nearbymention:Whittier,Elizabeth,,,"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName>'s whole temperament; and it ended in their being, for a time at least, leaders and combatants in <num value="2">two</num> separate armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>This involved some differences of attitude on very pressing questions; and the transfer of the other antislavery newspaper, the <hi rend="italics">Emancipator</hi>, to the possession of those who could not wholly support <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00067.00441" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,L.,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, was an act which divided families and left seeds of bitterness of which the <quote>Life of <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00067.00442" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,L.,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName></quote> by his sons gives a thorough and laborious record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>In short, the question of union or disunion drew a sharp line of cleavage among those already enlisted, and it was impossible, I suppose, for the originators of the whole movement to do otherwise than they did <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> -this outcome involving, it must be owned, much bitter quarrelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>But I am glad to testify, for the credit of all concerned, that upon the younger men who came on the stage after the lines were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drawn, there was imposed no necessity of taking sides; and I never, for <num value="1">one</num>, found any difficulty in working with both bodies of men and women &mdash; the <name>Garrisonians</name> or Disunionists and the voting abolitionists or Liberty Party men. The latter, it must be remembered, was the organisation which became the <quote>Free Soil</quote> party, then the <quote>Republican</quote> party, and in that form finally controlled the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>It must be owned, however, in viewing the attitude of these <num value="2">two</num> dividing factions, that the <name>Disunionists</name> were in general the more interesting class personally and more eloquent in speech than their voting brethren, precisely because they could speak without the slightest reference to policy or organisation; that the very leaders of the latter, such as <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00068.00447" reg="nearbymention:Whittier,Elizabeth,,,"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sewall,,Samuel,E.,," id="n0204.0007.00068.00448" reg="default:Sewall,Samuel,E.,,"><foreName>Samuel</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Sewall</surname></persName>, happened to have no gift of platform eloquence, though much faculty of organising and conciliating; that the very fact of the entanglement of voting abolitionists with party leaders who never thoroughly belonged with them, such as <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00068.00449" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><surname>Clay</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, was an embarrassment and a hindrance; and finally, that the immense and unflinching weight of the women, as non-voters, was thrown on the side of <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0204.0007.00068.00450" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,L.,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> and his party, whereas the voting abolitionists were often tempted to keep rather shy of a non-voting sex. All this I say, although observation has taught me that all these differences of policy, which seemed such a life-and-death matter at the time, are now as uninteresting to the younger generation as is antimasonry or any other cause which <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> once shook the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>I am very well aware that merely personal explanations are not likely to be as interesting to the public as to the parties concerned; but I am induced to notice what is either a misconception on thy part, or as is most probable, a failure on my own to make myself clearly understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>In the review of <quote> The Tent on the <name>Beach</name>,</quote> in thy paper of last week, I confess I was not a little surprised to find myself represented as regretting my lifelong and active participation in the great conflict which has ended in the emancipation of the slave, and that I had not devoted myself to merely literary pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>In the half-playful lines upon which this statement is founded, if I did not feel at liberty to boast of my antislavery labours and magnify my editorial profession, I certainly did not mean to underrate them, or express the shadow of a regret that they had occupied so large a share of my time and thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>The simple fact is, that I cannot be sufficiently thankful to the <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> that so early called my attention to the great interests of humanity, saving me from the poor ambitions and miserable jealousies of a selfish pursuit of literary reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>It chanced that we had been making notes, with much interest, upon the genius of the <name>Semitic</name> nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>That peculiar simplicity, centrality, and intensity which caused them to originate Monotheism from <num value="2">two</num> independent centres, the only systems of pure Monotheism which have had power in history, while the same characteristics made their poetry always lyrical, never epic or dramatic, and their most vigorous thought a perpetual sacrifice on the altars of the will, this had strongly impressed us; and we seemed to find in it a striking contrast to the characteristic genius of the <name>Aryan</name> or Indo-Germanic nations, with their imaginative interpretations of the religious sentiment, with their epic and dramatic expansions, and their taste for breadth and variety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>Somewhat warm with these notions we came to a meeting with our poet, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought on seeing him was-- <quote>The head of a Hebrew prophet!</quote>
