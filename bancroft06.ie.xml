<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>the present Volume completes the <name>History</name> of the <rs>American Revolution</rs>, considered in its causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The <num value="3">three</num> last explain the rise of the <orgName n="United States Union" type="union">union of the United States</orgName> from the body of the people, the change in the colonial policy of <placeName>France</placeName>, and the consequences of the persevering ambition of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to consolidate its power over <placeName>America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The penal Acts of <dateStruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></dateStruct> dissolved the moral connection between the <num value="2">two</num> countries, and began the civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The importance of the subject justified comprehensive research.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Of printed works my own collection is not inconsiderable; and whatever else is to be found in the largest public, or private libraries, particularly in those of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>, the <rs>Boston Athenaeum</rs>, which is very rich in pamphlets, and the <orgName n="British Museum" type="museum">British Museum</orgName>, have been within my reach.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Still greater instruction was derived from manuscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The records of the <rs type="place">State Paper Office</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> best illustrate the colonial system of that country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The opportunity of consulting them was granted me by the <rs>Earl</rs> of <placeName>Aberdeen</placeName>, when <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, and continued by <persName n="Palmerston,Viscount,,,," id="n0331.0001.00000.00001" reg="mostcommon:Palmerston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Viscount">Viscount</roleName> <surname>Palmerston</surname></persName>, by <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Grey</foreName></persName>, and by the <rs>Duke</rs> <pb n="iv"/> of <placeName>Newcastle</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>They include the voluminous correspondence of all military and civil officers, and Indian Agents, employed in <placeName>America</placeName>; memorials of the <rs>American</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioners</rs> of Customs; narratives, affidavits, informations, and answers of witnesses, illustrating the most important occurrences; the journals of the <orgName n="Trade Board" type="board">Board of Trade</orgName>; its Representations to the <rs>King</rs>; its intercourse with the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>; the instructions and letters, sent to <placeName>America</placeName>, whether from the <rs>King</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, or the <orgName n="Trade Board" type="board">Board of Trade</orgName>; the elaborate abstracts of documents prepared for the <name>Council</name>; opinions of the <rs>Attorney</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Solicitor-General">Solicitor General</rs>; and occasionally private letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>I examined these masses of documents slowly and carefully; I had access to every thing that is preserved; and of no paper however secret it may have been in its day, or whatever its complexion, was a copy refused me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>I owe to <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n0331.0001.00000.00002" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> permission to extend my inquiries to the records of the <name>Treasury</name>, of which he at the time was the head; so that all the volumes of its Minutes and its Letter-books, which could throw light on the subject of my inquiries, came under my inspection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The proceedings in Parliament till <dateStruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></dateStruct> had something of a confidential character; from sources the most various, private letters, journals, and reports, preserved in <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, or <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, or in <placeName>America</placeName>, I have obtained full and trustworthy accounts of the debates on the days most nearly affecting <placeName>America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Many papers, interesting to <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0331.0001.00000.00003" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, are preserved in the <orgName n="British Museum" type="museum">British Museum</orgName>, where I have great reason to remember the considerate attention of <persName n="Ellis,Sir,Henry,,," id="n0331.0001.00000.00004" reg="default:Ellis,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Ellis</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It was necessary to study the character and conduct <pb n="v"/> of the <rs>English Ministers</rs> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Of <placeName>Chatham</placeName>'s private letters perhaps few remain unpublished; <persName n="Disney,Mister,,,," id="n0331.0001.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Disney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Disney</surname></persName> imparted to me at the <name>Hyde</name>, <num value="2">two</num> volumes of familiar notes, that passed between <persName n="Chatham,,,,," id="n0331.0001.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Chatham,England,,,:1"><surname>Chatham</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hollis,,,,," id="n0331.0001.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hollis,Thomas,,,:24"><surname>Hollis</surname></persName>, full of allusions to <placeName>America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The <rs>Marquis</rs> of <persName><foreName>Lansdowne</foreName></persName> consented to my request for permission to go through the papers of his father, the <rs>Earl</rs> of <persName><foreName>Shelburne</foreName></persName>, during the <num value="3">three</num> periods of his connection with American affairs; and allowed me to keep them, till by a continued examination and comparison they could be understood in all their aspects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Combined with manuscripts which I obtained in <placeName>France</placeName>, they give all the information that can be desired for illustrating <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Shelburne</foreName></persName>'s relations with <placeName>America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>My thanks are also due to the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName>Grafton</placeName>, for having communicated to me unreservedly the autobiography of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> <rs type="role" reg="Duc">Duke</rs> of that name, who besides having himself been a Prime Minister, held office with <persName n="Rockingham,,,,," id="n0331.0001.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Rockingham,nomatch:0"><surname>Rockingham</surname></persName>, <placeName>Chatham</placeName>, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>North</foreName></persName>, and <persName><foreName>Shelburne</foreName></persName>.

<p>The controversy between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and her Colonies attracted the attention of all <placeName>Europe</placeName>, till at length it became universally the subject of leading interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>To give completeness to this branch of my inquiries, in so far as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was concerned either as a party or an observer, the necessary documents, after the most thorough and extensive search, were selected from the <name>Correspondence</name> with Ministers, <rs type="role" n="Agent">Agents</rs>, and others in <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, <placeName reg="Nederland" key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName>, and several of the smaller German Courts, especially <placeName reg="Kassel" key="tgn,7005941">Hesse Cassel</placeName> and <placeName reg="Braunschweig" key="tgn,1002197">Brunswick</placeName>.
