<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>An honorable record did this old corvette leave behind her. Of the type of vessel that had fought in the <rs>War</rs> of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, she had gone through the <rs>Mexican War</rs>, and had chased and captured many a slaver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>But a year or so ago, she was still afloat as the training-ship of the <orgName type="mil" key="NJstateMilitia">New Jersey state militia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>She has every sail up except her head-sails and studding sails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>As can be seen at a glance, she was a very lofty craft, and though clewed up, she has her sky-sails, her royals, her topgallant-sails, her topsails, set on every mast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/><quote>Excellent, whether sailing, steering, working, scudding, lying to, or riding at anchor in a seaway, she sometimes got her sternboard in stays.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Few annals in the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are of greater and more compelling interest than those connected with the achievement of its sailors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Their records, penned by historians and novelists, form brilliant pages in American literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Therefore, it was not strange that a conflict in which officers and seamen of the same race and speech, graduates of the same historic <orgName n="Naval Academy" type="academy">Naval Academy</orgName> and sailing the same seas and along the same shores, met in heroic struggle, should form a story <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to none in its fascination and interest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The Civil War ships and the men who fought them are distinctive in naval history, not for immensity of single battles or extent of total destruction, but for diversity of action, the complete realization of the ironclad as a fighting vessel, and the development of the torpedo as a weapon of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Readers are fortunate in finding, at the outset of this volume, the scholarly appreciation by <persName n="Chadwick,Admiral,,,," id="n0111.0001.00011.00009" reg="nearbymention:Chadwick,F.,E.,,"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> of the essential part played by the navies in the war, while the battles at sea and on inland waters are described by <persName n="Barnes,Mister,,,," id="n0111.0001.00011.00010" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName> with a vividness possible only to a naval historian to whom the sea and its sailors long have been objects of sympathetic study.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The photographic record of the great American conflict <pb id="p.12" n="12"/>is particularly striking in this volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Never before has there been assembled such a pictorial and actual record of fleets and sailors, Union and Confederate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The stately frigate with walls of live-oak, the newly born ironclad, the swift blockade-runner, the commerce-destroying cruiser, which left its indelible mark on the <rs>American</rs> merchant marine no less than on international law, and last, but not least, the actors in scenes of the great naval drama appear on the pages that follow, in an illustrated <quote>catalogue of the ships</quote> that even <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0111.0001.00012.00011" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName> in his stately Iliad could have envied. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Looking out from the mouth of every important harbor along the <rs>Southern</rs> seacoast, the <rs>Confederates</rs> were confronted by just such a grim menace as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Riding at anchor or moving swiftly from point to point, the <rs>Federal</rs> fighting-ships, with sleepless vigilance, night and day sought every opportunity to destroy the vessels which attempted to keep up the commercial intercourse of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> with the outside world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it was chiefly a <quote>paper blockade,</quote> and the fact that its mere announcement accorded to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> the status of belligerents was hailed at the <rs>South</rs> as a fortunate diplomatic mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><persName n="Swift,,,,," id="n0111.0002.00014.00013" reg="mostcommon:Swift,nomatch:0"><surname>Swift</surname></persName> merchantmen abroad were easily induced to enter the bold enter-prise which meant such profitable trade; laughing at the inadequate Federal patrol, they began to dump huge cargoes of the munitions of war at every Southern port, taking in return cotton, so necessary to keep the looms of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>With the rapid growth of the <rs>Federal</rs> navy the blockade, whose early impotence had been winked at by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> powers, became more and more a fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The cordon was drawn tighter and tighter from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>. <num value="1">One</num> venturesome vessel after another was overhauled or driven ashore and both they and their cargoes became the rich prizes of the <rs>Federal</rs> navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>While this served vastly to increase the difficulty and danger of dealing with the <rs>South</rs>, it did not deter greatly the bold spirits to whom this war-time commerce was so profitable and necessary, and down to the fall of the last Southern seaport swift blockade-runners were found that could continue to show the beleaguering fleet a clean pair of heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>From the war's very beginning the <rs>Confederates</rs> were hopeful of being able to oppose the <rs>Federal</rs> navy with fighting-vessels that would raise the blockade, but they could not build boats fast enough, and almost as soon as they were finished they were captured or destroyed in <num value="1">one</num> bold attempt after another to contend with the superior numbers that opposed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Once at <placeName key="tgn,7017444" n="1.000 5" reg="mobile, mobile, alabama">Mobile</placeName> and again at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 7" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, after a naval victory the <rs>Confederates</rs> proclaimed the blockade raised, only to find that in a few days the investing fleet had been doubled in strength.
