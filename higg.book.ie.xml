<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="1" n="I"><num value="1">1</num></num>: discontinuance of the guide-board</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>Perhaps the last indulgence yet to be won by the writer of fiction will be that of discontinuing the time-honored institution of the guide-board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Many still expect it to stand visible on his closing pages, at least, and to be marked, when necessary, <quote><rs type="role2">Private</rs> way,</quote> <quote>Dangerous passing,</quote> that there may be no mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Yet surely all tendencies now lead to the abandonment of that time-honored proclamation; and this change comes simply from the fact that fiction is drawing nearer to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In real life, as we see it, the moral is usually implied and inferential, not painted on a board; you must often look twice, or look many times, in order to read it. The eminent sinner dies amid tears and plaudits, not in the state-prison, as he should; the seed of the righteous is often seen begging bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>We have to read very carefully between the lines if we would <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> fully recognize the joy of <persName n="Marcellus,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00004.00001" reg="mostcommon:Marcellus,nomatch:0"><surname>Marcellus</surname></persName> exiled, the secret ennui of <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00004.00002" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName> with a senate at his heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Thus it is in daily life &mdash; that is, in nature; and yet many still think it a defect in a story if it leaves a single moral influence to be worked out by the meditation of the reader.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>On my lending to an intelligent young woman, the other day, <persName n="Garland,Mister,Hamlin,,," id="n0178.0001.00004.00003" reg="default:Garland,Hamlin,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Hamlin</foreName> <surname>Garland</surname></persName>'s remarkable volume, <title>Main-travelled roads,</title> she returned it with the remark that she greatly admired all the stories except the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, which seemed to her immoral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It closed, indeed, as she justly pointed out, with a striking scene in which a long-absent lover carries off the wife and child of a successful but unworthy rival, and the tale ends with the words: <quote>The sun shone on the dazzling, rustling wheat; the fathomless sky as a sea bent over them, and the world lay before them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>But when I pointed out to her, what <num value="1">one</num> would think must be clear at a glance to every reader, that behind this momentary gleam of beauty lay an absolutely hopeless future; that though the impulse of action was wholly generous, and not even passional, yet <persName n="Nemesis,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00004.00004" reg="mostcommon:Nemesis,nomatch:0"><surname>Nemesis</surname></persName> was close behind; and that the mere fact of the woman's carrying another man's baby in her arms would prevent <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> all permanent happiness with her lover; my friend could only reply that it was all very true, but she had never thought of it. In other words, the guide-board was not there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The only thing that could have disarmed her criticism would have been a distinct announcement on the author's part: <quote>N. B. The situation is dangerous;</quote> just as <persName n="Edgeworth,Miss,,,," id="n0178.0001.00005.00005" reg="mostcommon:Edgeworth,Maria,,,:1"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Edgeworth</surname></persName> used to append to every particularly tough statement: <quote>N. B. This is a fact.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The truth is, that in <persName n="Edgeworth,Miss,,,," id="n0178.0001.00005.00006" reg="mostcommon:Edgeworth,Maria,,,:1"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Edgeworth</surname></persName>'s day they ordered the matter differently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Either the sinners and saints were called up by name in the closing chapter, and judgment rendered in detail, or else very explicit reasons were given why the obvious award was impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><quote>The <rs>Lord Lilburnes</rs> of this hollow world are not to be pelted with the soft roses of poetical justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He is alone with old age and in the sight of death.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Thus stands the guide-board at the close of <persName n="Bulwer,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00005.00007" reg="mostcommon:Bulwer,nomatch:0"><surname>Bulwer</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Night and Morning;</hi> and in the discontinuance of such aids there is doubtless a certain risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Some of the most powerful works of modern fiction have apparently failed to impress their moral on the careless reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>All really strong novels involving illicit love are necessarily tragedies at last, not vaudevilles; and nowhere is <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> this more true than in <name>French</name> literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The clever woman who said that nothing was worse than <name>French</name> immorality except <name>French</name> morality, simply failed to go below the surface; for in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> the family feeling is so potent that the actual destruction of the domestic tie is often punished with cruel severity, even by the most tolerant novelists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The retribution in <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Bovary,Madame,,,," id="n0178.0001.00006.00008" reg="mostcommon:Bovary,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <surname>Bovary</surname></persName></hi>, for instance, is almost too merciless, since it wreaks itself even upon the body of the poor sinner after death, and pursues her unoffending child to the poorhouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>No <num value="1">one</num> has painted a climax of unlawful passion more terrific than that portrayed in the closing pages of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Camors,Monsieur,,,,de" id="n0178.0001.00006.00009" reg="mostcommon:Camors,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Monsieur">Monsieur</roleName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Camors</surname></persName></hi>, the guilty pair, false to every human obligation, successful in their wishes to their own destruction, <foreign lang="la">numinibus vota exandita malignis</foreign>, detached by their crime from all the world and finally from <num value="1">one</num> another, wander like gloomy shadows amid an earthly paradise, meeting sometimes unwarily, but never exchanging a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Yet both these novels are sometimes classed among the bad books, simply because the guide-board is omitted and the reader left to draw his own moral.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The same misjudgment is often passed for the same reason upon <persName n="Tolstoi,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00006.00010" reg="mostcommon:Tolstoi,nomatch:0"><surname>Tolstoi</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Karinina,,Anna,,," id="n0178.0001.00007.00011" reg="default:Karinina,Anna,,,"><foreName>Anna</foreName> <surname>Karinina</surname></persName></hi>, which surely is, among all books upon this same theme, the most utterly relentless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Not merely does it not contain, from beginning to end, a prurient scene or even a voluptuous passage, but its plot moves as inexorably and almost as visibly as a Greek fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Even <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00007.00012" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> allows his guilty lovers, in <hi rend="italics">The Scarlet Letter</hi>, a moment of delusive happiness; even <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00007.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> recognizes the unquestionable truth that the foremost result of a broken law is sometimes an enchanting sense of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><persName n="Tolstoi,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00007.00014" reg="mostcommon:Tolstoi,nomatch:0"><surname>Tolstoi</surname></persName> tolerates no such enchantment; and he has written the only novel of illicit love, perhaps, in which the offenders-both being persons otherwise high-minded and noble-fail to derive from their sin <num value="1">one</num> hour of even temporary happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>From the moment of their yielding we see the shadow already over them; the author is as merciless to these beings of his own construction as if he hated them; and <num value="1">one</num> feels like calling in an <persName n="Khayyam,,Omar,,," id="n0178.0001.00007.00015" reg="default:Khayyam,Omar,,,"><foreName>Omar</foreName> <surname>Khayyam</surname></persName> to defend once more the created against an unjust creator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Yet <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Karenina,,Anna,,," id="n0178.0001.00007.00016" reg="default:Karenina,Anna,,,"><foreName>Anna</foreName> <surname>Karenina</surname></persName></hi> has often been condemned as immoral, in the absence of the guide-board.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If, now, we consider, in the light of these striking instances, what it is that has brought about this gradual disuse of the overt and visible <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> moral, we shall soon see that it is a part of the general tendency of modern literature to do without external aids to make its meaning clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>There is undoubtedly a tendency to rely more and more upon what has been well called <quote>the presumption of brains</quote> in the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Note, for instance, the steady disappearance of the italic letter from the printed page.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Once used as freely as in an epistle from <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Thackeray,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00008.00017" reg="mostcommon:Thackeray,nomatch:0"><surname>Thackeray</surname></persName>'s fine ladies, it is now employed by careful writers almost wholly to indicate foreign words or book titles; a change in which <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00008.00018" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00008.00019" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> were conspicuous leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There is a feeling that only a very crude literary art will now depend on typography for shades of meaning which should be rendered by the very structure of the sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The same fate of banishment is overtaking the exclamation-point, so long used by poets-conspicuously by <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00008.00020" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,nomatch:0"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> &mdash; as a note of admiration also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Here, too, as in the other case, the emphasis is now left to render itself; and even the last verse of the poem, which often &mdash; to cite <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00008.00021" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,nomatch:0"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> again-contained the detached moral of the lay, is now commonly clipped off, leaving the reader to draw the moral for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The poet now makes his point as best he can, and leaves it <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> without a guide-board; in this foreshadowing precisely that change which has also come over the prose novel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Granting that much fiction, at any rate, has a moral expressed or implied, it is to be observed that all fiction has changed its note in other respects within the last century, and must accept its own laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Formerly conveying its moral often through a symbol, it now conveys it, if at all, by direct narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The distinction has never been better put than in a remarkable and little-known letter addressed by <persName n="Heine,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00009.00022" reg="mostcommon:Heine,nomatch:0"><surname>Heine</surname></persName> on his death-bed (<dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>) to <persName n="Ense,,Varnhagen,von,," id="n0178.0001.00009.00023" reg="default:Ense,Varnhagen,von,,"><foreName>Varnhagen</foreName> <foreName>von</foreName> <surname>Ense</surname></persName>, in giving a personal introduction to <persName n="Lassalle,,Ferdinand,,," id="n0178.0001.00009.00024" reg="default:Lassalle,Ferdinand,,,"><foreName>Ferdinand</foreName> <surname>Lassalle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><quote>The new generation,</quote> wrote <persName n="Heine,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00009.00025" reg="mostcommon:Heine,nomatch:0"><surname>Heine</surname></persName>, <quote>means to enjoy itself and make the best of the visible; we of the older <num value="1">one</num> bowed humbly before the invisible, yearned after shadow kisses and blue-flower fragrances, denied ourselves, wept and smiled and were perhaps happier than these fierce gladiators who walk so proudly to meet their death-struggle.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The blue-flower allusion is to the favorite ideal symbol of the <rs>German Novalis</rs>; and certainly the young men who grew up <num value="50">fifty</num> or <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> ago in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> obtained some of their very best tonic influences through such thoroughly ideal tales as <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> that writer's <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Offerdingen,,Heinrich,von,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00026" reg="default:Offerdingen,Heinrich,von,,"><foreName>Heinrich</foreName> <foreName>von</foreName> <surname>Offerdingen</surname></persName></hi>, Fouque's <hi rend="italics">Sintram</hi>, <persName n="Hoffmann,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00027" reg="mostcommon:Hoffmann,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoffmann</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Goldene Topf</hi>, and <persName n="Richter,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00028" reg="mostcommon:Richter,nomatch:0"><surname>Richter</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Titan,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00029" reg="mostcommon:Titan,nomatch:0"><surname>Titan</surname></persName></hi>, whether these were read in the original <rs>German</rs> or in the translations of <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00030" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>, <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00031" reg="mostcommon:Brooks,nomatch:0"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>All these books are now little sought, and rather alien to the present taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>To these were added, in <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00032" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, such tales as <persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00033" reg="mostcommon:Poe,Edgar,Allan,,:1"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Wilson,,William,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00034" reg="default:Wilson,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName></hi> and <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00035" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">The Birthmark</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Rappaccini's Daughter,;</hi> and, in <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00036" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, <persName n="Balzac,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00037" reg="mostcommon:Balzac,nomatch:0"><surname>Balzac</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Le <persName n="Chagrin,,Peau,,,de" id="n0178.0001.00010.00038" reg="expanded:Chagrin,Peau,,,"><foreName>Peau</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Chagrin</surname></persName></hi>, which <persName n="Longfellow,Professor,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00039" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> used warmly to recommend to his college pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Works like these represented the prevailing sentiment of a period; they exerted a distinct influence on the moulding of a generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Their moral was irresistible for those who really cared enough for the books to read them; they needed no guide-boards; the guide-board was for the earlier efforts at realism, before it had proved its strength.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Realism has since achieved its maturity, and undoubtedly has won &mdash; if it has not already lost again-possession of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Whether its sway be, as many think, a permanent change, or only, as I myself believe, a swing of the pendulum, the fact is the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is as useless to resist such changes as it was for <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00010.00040" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> to go on lighting his pipe for years <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> with flint and steel, which I well remember his doing, rather than accept the innovation of a friction-match.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Realism must hold the field so long as it has a right to do it, and it can only be asked to fulfil the conditions of its being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If we excuse it, as we plainly must, from the perpetuation of the guide-board, we can only ask that it shall go on and do its work so well that no such aid shall be needed; that its moral, where there is <num value="1">one</num>, shall be reasonably plain; that is, so clearly put as to produce a minimum of misunderstanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>How important this is may be appreciated when we consider that so great an artist as <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00011.00041" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, writing <hi rend="italics">Die Wahlverwandschaften</hi>, expressly, as he thought, to vindicate the marriage laws, was supposed by his whole generation to have written against them, simply through an ill-chosen title and a single unseemly incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>And another reasonable condition is that fiction, being thus set free, should be a law unto itself and stop short of undesirable materials; that it should obey that high and significant maxim of the <rs>Roman</rs> augurs-never to let the sacred entrails be displayed outside the solemnity of the temple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is for disregard in this respect, and not for any want of serious purpose-since he usually has such a purpose, <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> and does not write with levity &mdash; that <persName n="Zola,,,,," id="n0178.0001.00012.00042" reg="mostcommon:Zola,nomatch:0"><surname>Zola</surname></persName> is to be condemned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But granting these simple conditions fulfilled, the writer of fiction should surely be allowed henceforth to wind up his story in his own way, without formal proclamation of his moral; or, better still, to leave the tale without technical and elaborate winding up, as nature leaves her stories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>His work is a great <num value="1">one</num>, to bring comedy and even tragedy down from the old traditions of kingliness to the vaster and more complex currents of modern democratic life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>When the elder Scaliger wrote, in <dateStruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></dateStruct>, that work on Poetry which so long ruled the traditions of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> literature, he defined the difference between tragedy and comedy to consist largely in this &mdash; that tragedy concerned itself only with kings, princes, cities, citadels, and camps; <foreign lang="la">in tragoedia reges, principles, ex urbibus, arcibus, castris</foreign>. All these things are now changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName>, princes, camps, citadels are passing away, and the cities that will soon alone survive them are filled with a democratic world, which awaits its chronicles of joy or pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The writer of fiction must tell his tale, and leave it to yield its own moral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The careless or hasty reader will often misinterpret it, and would do so were <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> the guide-board ever so conspicuous; but the serious student will bear away an influence proportioned to the hidden wealth of meaning, and this meaning will be more precious in proportion as he has been left to discern it for himself.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>For those more cultivated, the charm of this transmitted personality is best embodied <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> in autographs, and the more unstudied and unpremeditated the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>In the case of a poet, nothing can be compared with the interest inspired by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> draft of a poem, with its successive amendments &mdash; the path by which his thought attained its final and perfect utterance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/><persName n="Tennyson,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00015.00046" reg="mostcommon:Tennyson,nomatch:0"><surname>Tennyson</surname></persName>, it is reported, was very indignant with those who bore away from his study certain rough drafts of poems, justly holding that the world had no right to any but the completed form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Yet this is what, as students of poetry, we all instinctively wish to do. Rightly or wrongly, we long to trace the successive steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>To some extent, the same opportunity is given in successive editions of the printed work, but here the study is not so much of changes in the poet's own mind as of those produced by the criticisms, often dull or ignorant, of his readers; those especially who fail to catch a poet's very finest thought, and persuade him to dilute it a little for their satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>When I pointed out to <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00015.00047" reg="mostcommon:Browning,nomatch:0"><surname>Browning</surname></persName> some rather unfortunate alterations in his later editions, and charged him with having made them to accommodate stupid people, he admitted the charge and promised to alter them back again, although, of course, he never did. But the changes in an author's manuscript almost <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> always come either from his own finer perception and steady advance toward the precise conveyance of his own thought, or else from the aid he receives in this from some immediate friend or adviser-most likely a woman &mdash; who is in close sympathy with his own mood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The charm is greatest, of course, in seeing and studying and touching the actual page, just as it is. For this a photograph is the best substitute, since it preserves the original for the eye, as does the phonograph for the ear. Even with the aid of photography only, there is as much difference between the final corrected shape and the page showing the gradual changes as between the graceful yacht lying in harbor, anchored, motionless, with sails furled, and the same yacht as a winged creature, gliding into port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Let us now see, by actual comparison, how <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00016.00048" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName>'s yachts came in.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>There lies before me a photograph of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> stanzas of <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00016.00049" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName>'s <quote>Ode on Melancholy</quote> as they stood when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The manuscript page containing them was given to <persName n="Payne,,John,Howard,," id="n0178.0002.00016.00050" reg="default:Payne,John,Howard,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Howard</foreName> <surname>Payne</surname></persName> by <persName n="Keats,,George,,," id="n0178.0002.00016.00051" reg="default:Keats,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Keats</surname></persName>, the poet's brother, who lived for many years at <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville, Kentucky</placeName>, and died there; but it now belongs to <persName n="Chilton,Mister,R.,S.,," id="n0178.0002.00016.00052" reg="default:Chilton,R.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Chilton</surname></persName>, United <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> States Consul at <placeName reg="Goderich,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" key="tgn,1014792">Goderich, Ontario</placeName>, who has kindly given me a photograph of it. The verses are in <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00017.00053" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName>'s well-known and delicate handwriting, and exhibit a series of erasures and substitutions which are now most interesting, inasmuch as the changes in each instance enrich greatly the value of the word-painting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>To begin with, the title varies slightly from that now adopted, and reads simply <quote>On Melancholy,</quote> to which the word <quote>Ode</quote> is now prefixed by the printers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, where he had half written <quote>Henbane</quote> for the material of his incantation, he blots it out and puts <quote>Wolfsbane,</quote> instantly abandoning the tamer suggestion and bringing in all the wildness and the superstition that have gathered for years around the <name>Loupgarou</name> and the <name>Wehrwolf</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>This is plainly no amendment suggested afterward by another person, but is due unmistakably to the quick action of his own mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>There is no other change until the end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stanza, where the last <num value="2">two</num> lines were originally written thus: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/></p><l>For shade to shade will come too heavily</l> <l>And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.</l></quote> </p> 
<p rend="rend=left">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It is noticeable that he originally wrote <quote>down</quote> for <quote>drown,</quote> and, in afterward inserting <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> the r, put it in the wrong place-after the <hi rend="italics">o</hi>, instead of before it. This was a slip of the pen only; but it was that word <quote>heavily</quote> which cost him a struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The words <quote>too heavily</quote> were next crossed out, and under them written <quote>too sleepily</quote> ; then this last word was again erased, and the word <quote>drowsily</quote> was finally substituted &mdash; the only expression in the <rs>English</rs> language, perhaps, which could have precisely indicated the exact shade of debilitating languor he meant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>In the other stanza, it is noticeable that he spells <quote>melancholy,</quote> through heedlessness, <quote>melanancholy,</quote> which gives a curious effect of prolonging and deepening the incantation; and this error he does not discover or correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>In the same way he spells <quote>fit</quote> <quote>fitt,</quote> having perhaps in mind the <quote>fytte</quote> of the earlier poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>These are trifles, but when he alters the line, which originally stood</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/><quote>But when the melancholy fit shall come,</quote> and for <quote>come</quote> substitutes <quote>fall,</quote> we see at once, besides the merit of the soft alliteration, that he gives more of the effect of doom and suddenness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><quote>Come</quote> was clearly too businesslike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Afterward, instead of</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/><quote>Then feed thy sorrow on a morning rose,</quote> <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> he substitutes for <quote>feed</quote> the inexpressibly more effective word <quote>glut,</quote> which gives at once the exhaustive sense of wealth belonging so often to <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00020.00054" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName>'s poetry; and seems to match the full ecstasy of color and shape and fragrance that a morning rose may hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Finally, in the line which originally stood <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/></p><l>Or on the rainbow of the dashing wave,</l></quote> he strikes out the rather trite epithet <quote>dashing</quote> and substitutes the stronger phrase <quote>salt-sand wave,</quote> which is peculiar to him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>All these changes are happily accepted in the common editions of <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00020.00055" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName>; but these editions make <num value="2">two</num> errors that are corrected by this manuscript and should henceforth be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>In the line usually printed</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/><quote>Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be,</quote> the autograph text gives <quote>or</quote> in place of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <quote>nor,</quote> a change consonant with the best usage; and in the line</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/><quote>And hides the green hill in an April shroud,</quote> the middle word is clearly not <quote>hill,</quote> but <quote>hills.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>This is a distinct improvement, both because it broadens the landscape and because it averts the jangle of the closing <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> with the final words <quote>fall</quote> and <quote>all</quote> in previous lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It is a fortunate thing that, in the uncertain destiny of all literary manuscripts, this characteristic document should have been preserved for us. It will be remembered that <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00021.00056" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName> himself once wrote in a letter that his fondest prayer, next to that for the health of his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, would be that some child of his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> <quote>should be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> American poet.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>This letter, printed by <persName n="Milnes,,,,," id="n0178.0002.00021.00057" reg="mostcommon:Milnes,nomatch:0"><surname>Milnes</surname></persName>, was written <dateStruct value="1818-10-29"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg="29">29</day>, <year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It is pleasant to think that we have, through the care exercised by this Americanized brother, an opportunity of coming into close touch with the mental processes of that rare genius which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> imparted something like actual color to <name>English</name> words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>It is a commonplace saying &mdash; and I think it is Quintilian who recommends that in treating every important subject we should begin from the commonplace, though this is indeed not difficult &mdash; that we live in an age of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>We are assured without ceasing, and it is, within just limits, perfectly true, that modern science has transformed the world of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The world of action it has certainly transformed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Scientific mechanics are keeping pace, in the most astounding way, with abstract science; and we are all, as has been said, <quote>gazing into the light of the future, our profoundest curiosity quivering under the currents of new thought as a magnet vibrates in the grasp of an induction-coil.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>A <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> ago, when a prince wished to travel, he could at best only order clumsy horses to be attached to a clumsy state carriage in the hope of accomplishing, unless torrents or highwaymen interfered, <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> a day. It was not until the people got ready to ride that steeds swifter than the wind and stronger than the storm were harnessed in, and glittering bands of steel were spread in twin extension across the continent, that the carriages which bore the people might not swerve from their triumphant way. <measure n="200years" type="date">Two hundred years</measure> ago, if a king wished to convey to a distance the news of war or peace, or of the birth of an heir, he could do it best by lighting vast bonfires on successive hills, as in the <rs>Agamemnon</rs> of <persName n="Aeschylus,,,,," id="n0178.0004.00029.00081" reg="mostcommon:Aeschylus,nomatch:0"><surname>Aeschylus</surname></persName> (<foreign lang="greek">toioi/de lampadhfo/rwn no/moi</foreign>), until the tale was told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The breathlessness, the hurry, the confusion, the seeming aimlessness, as of a whole family of disturbed ants, running to and fro, yet somehow accomplishing something at last; all these aspects, which might seem the most elementary and the easiest to depict, are yet those surest to be omitted, not merely by the novelists, <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> but by the regimental histories themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>I know that when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> read <persName n="Tolstoi,,,,," id="n0178.0005.00042.00124" reg="mostcommon:Tolstoi,nomatch:0"><surname>Tolstoi</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">War and Peace, The Cossacks and <placeName reg="Sevastopol', Krym, Ukrayina" key="tgn,7012057">Sevastopol</placeName></hi>, it seemed as if all other so-called military novels must become at once superannuated and go out of print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>All others assumed, in comparison, that bandbox aspect which may be seen in most military or naval pictures; as in the well-known engraving of the death of <persName n="Nelson,,,,," id="n0178.0005.00042.00125" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelson</surname></persName>, where the hero is sinking on the deck in perfect toilette, at the height of a bloody conflict, while every soldier or sailor is grouped around him, each in heroic attitude and spotless garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>It is this <persName n="Tolstoi,,,,," id="n0178.0005.00042.00126" reg="mostcommon:Tolstoi,nomatch:0"><surname>Tolstoi</surname></persName> quality &mdash; the real tumult and tatters of the thing itself-which amazes the reader of <persName n="Crane,,,,," id="n0178.0005.00042.00127" reg="nearbymention:Crane,Stephen,,,"><surname>Crane</surname></persName>'s novel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Moreover, <persName n="Tolstoy,,,,," id="n0178.0005.00042.00128" reg="mostcommon:Tolstoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Tolstoy</surname></persName> had been through it all in person; whereas this author is a youth of <num value="24">twenty-four</num>, it seems, born since the very last shot fired in the <rs>Civil War</rs>. How did he hit upon his point of view?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Yet this very point of view, strange to say, has been called a defect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Remember that he is telling the tale, not of a commanding general, but of a common soldier &mdash; a pawn in the game; a man who sees only what is going on immediately around him, and, for the most <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> part, has the key to nothing beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>This he himself knows well at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Afterward, perhaps, when the affair is discussed at the camp-fire, and his view compared with what others say, it begins to take shape, often mixed with all sorts of errors; and when it has reached the <rs>Grand Army Post</rs> and been talked over afterward for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, the narrator has not a doubt of it all. It has become a perfectly ordered affair, a neat and well-arranged game of chess, often with himself as a leading figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Such is the result of too much perspective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The wonder is that this young writer, who had no way of getting at the facts except through the gossip-printed or written &mdash; of these very old soldiers, should be able to go behind them all, and give an account of their life, not only more vivid than they themselves have ever given, but more accurate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It really seems a touch of that marvellous intuitive quality which for want of a better name we call genius.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Now is it a correct criticism of the book to complain, as <num value="1">one</num> writer has done, that it does not dwell studiously on the higher aspects of the war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Let the picture only be well drawn, and the moral will take care of itself; never fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The book is not a patriotic tract, but a <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> delineation; a cross section of the daily existence of the raw enlisted-man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>In other respects it is reticent because it is truthful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Does any <num value="1">one</num> suppose that in the daily routine of the camp there was room for much fine talk about motives and results &mdash; that men were constantly appealing, like <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0178.0005.00044.00129" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s Frenchman, <quote>to posterity and the immortal Gods?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>He is to be judged by results; not by what he says, which is often ungracious and unornamental, but by what he does.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The very merit of this book is that in dealing with his men the author offers, within this general range, all the essential types of character &mdash; the man who boasts and the man who is humble &mdash; the man who thinks he may be frightened and is not, and the man who does not expect to be, but is. For his main character he selects a type to be found in every regiment &mdash; the young man who does not know himself, who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stumbles into cowardice, to his own amazement, and then is equally amazed <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> at stumbling into courage; who begins with skulking, and ends by taking a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>This is putting it too strongly, for some men are born more stolid, others more nervous; but the nervous man is quite as likely to have the firmer grain, and to come out the more heroic in the end. In my own limited experience, the only young officer whom I ever saw thoroughly and confessedly frightened, when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> under fire, was the only <num value="1">one</num> of his regiment who afterwards chose the regular army for his profession, and fought Indians for the rest of his life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>As for <hi rend="italics">The Red Badge of Courage</hi>, the test of the book is in the way it holds you. I only know that whenever I take it up I find myself reading it over and over, as I do <persName n="Tolstoi,,,,," id="n0178.0005.00045.00133" reg="mostcommon:Tolstoi,nomatch:0"><surname>Tolstoi</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Cossacks</hi>, and find it as hard to put down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Even the slipshod grammar seems a part of the breathless life and <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>How much promise it gives, it is hard to say. <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0178.0005.00046.00136" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName> says that as soon as a man has done <num value="1">one</num> good thing, the world conspires against him to keep him from doing another.

<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="11" n="XI"><num value="11">11</num></num>: the foe to eloquence</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>It is a curious fact that the greatest foe to eloquence, just now, is that same enterprising daily press which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> did so much to promote it. It is not merely that the press secures a better-informed community, although this has been sometimes thought to be less favorable to good public speaking than a more ignorant body of hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>A Southern justice of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> once told the present writer that there could be no really good oratory in a well-educated region; it could only be developed where the mass of people depended almost wholly on the orator for instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>This opinion is probably not well founded; it is probable that the better education simply shifts the grade of the oratory, and does not impair it. <persName n="Demosthenes,,,,," id="n0178.0011.00081.00305" reg="mostcommon:Demosthenes,nomatch:0"><surname>Demosthenes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pericles,,,,," id="n0178.0011.00081.00306" reg="mostcommon:Pericles,nomatch:0"><surname>Pericles</surname></persName> did not address an ignorant public, but <num value="1">one</num> highly trained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Nevertheless, on the <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> only occasion when the present writer ever addressed a typically Southern rural audience --at the <name>Spartansburg</name>, <name type="state" n="South Carolina"><placeName key="tgn,7007712" n="1.000 6435" reg="south carolina">South Carolina</placeName></name>, celebration, in <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct>-it was impossible not to be struck with a certain eagerness in the whole body of hearers, a sort of greediness, it might almost be said, to reach all that was to be had from the speakers, beyond anything ordinarily to be found at the <name>North</name> or <name>West</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>It was an attitude and bearing hardly compatible with the general reading of a daily paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>So far, indeed, it illustrated what <rs type="role" reg="Mister-Justice">Mr. Justice</rs> --had said; and yet it is doubtful, as has been already remarked, whether his opinion was quite correct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>The way in which the daily press operates as an obstacle to good public speaking is quite different from this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>When the art of verbatim reporting was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought to perfection, the reports became so admirable as to be a great encouragement to the orator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>It was a perfect delight for him to see the thoughts which had perhaps never even been written out appear in type before his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>It was a wonder, like the phonograph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The same thing sometimes occurs now, but only rarely, and often by special arrangement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>The daily press now attempts so much, has such a vast variety of <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> news to be served up in every number, that it must choose the easiest way to meet the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Now the easiest method is not to report a public address, in any proper sense, at all, but simply to call upon each public speaker to write out in advance what he means to say, and print it, often much curtailed, from his manuscript.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>This is accordingly what is more and more done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>When any public demonstration of sufficient importance occurs-a meeting, or even a dinner-each person announced as a speaker for it knows that he will receive calls from reporters, or a letter from the <rs>Associated Press</rs>, requesting <quote>a copy of his speech.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>It is a kind proposal, but it seems to assume that there is no such thing as spontaneity or freshness left in public oratory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>If he is a practised speaker the chances are that he does not yet know what he is going to say; that he will depend largely on the interest of the occasion, the atmosphere of the audience, the lead given by other speakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>It is, at any rate, certain that the more he is guided by these things the fresher and more animated his speech will be. If he prepares ever so much, the chances are that the best things in his speech will have come to him on the spur of the moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>This, indeed, is what <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> public speaking means; it is not public speaking, properly so called, when <num value="1">one</num> reads from a manuscript, and hardly such when a man recites what has been committed to memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Yet it is the present tendency of press methods to banish all other oratory except this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>It may be laid down as a general rule that the things which were most effective with an audience on a given occasion are rarely reported by the press; for the press follows more and more the cut-and-dried method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>This method discourages the speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>He knows in advance that either he must write for the journals of next morning or else speak for the audience of that evening; it is becoming more and more difficult to do both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>If he writes out his speech, and knows it to be in type, the freshness of the special adaptation is gone; he no longer talks with his audience as man to man. All is premeditated; he cannot avail himself of the glow of the moment, of the happy opportunity given by some passing incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>On the other hand, if he yields to these last desires, and deals at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hand with his hearers, he knows almost with certainty that his speech will either be dismissed unreported &mdash; which is not so bad-or will be given only in a few phrases caught haphazard, <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> and possibly quite reversing his line of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>He has his choice; he can rarely have both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>The only possible compromise is that which the present writer has sometimes adopted &mdash; to write out <num value="1">one</num> speech for the press, and then make, if needful, a wholly different <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>But this involves a double trouble, besides the incidental objection that it does not seem quite honest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>There is no doubt that the pleasantest societies for discussion are those in which reporting is strictly prohibited, because all reporting tends inevitably to the cut-and-dried, and drives out the freshness of off-hand speaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>It has been admitted for years at <orgName n="Harvard University" type="university">Harvard University</orgName> that the speaking at the <name>Commencement</name> dinner, which is always elaborately reported, is far less animated and brilliant than that at the <rs>Phi Beta Kappa</rs> dinner, which takes place the next day, commonly with some of the very same speakers, and is never reported at all. In this last case the speakers are talking to their hearers; in the other case they have usually written out their views for the benefit of the daily paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The <orgName n="Round Table" type="newspaper">Round Table</orgName> Club of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> has maintained, with almost unvarying success for many years, its monthly discussions on social and literary <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> topics-debates which have never yet been reported; while the old Radical Club in the same city, which was in its day as vivacious and animated, was practically killed at last by reporting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Not that the men and women who speak at such clubs have anything to conceal, but the essential difficulty is always the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>If you are talking for the newspapers you are sure to be misunderstood unless you write out what you mean to say, and if you do that, farewell to all freshness and spontaneity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>It is not intended in all this to throw blame upon the daily papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>They have a stupendous task, which they perform with amazing energy and method as regards quantity of information, and perhaps in time they will add accuracy also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Having on any given evening a score of public meetings to report, how can they do it, it may justly be asked, unless the speakers do their own reporting in advance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Nevertheless, it is likely that sooner or later some device or new invention will lead us out of the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Who knows but some future poly-phonograph may at some day reproduce in the daily papers of the next morning all that any public speaker said which was worth saying, or really told upon his audience, and may omit, with still greater felicity, all the rest?</p>

<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="12" n="XII"><num value="12">12</num></num>: the next step in journalism</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>It is notorious that every <num value="1">one</num> who does not edit a daily newspaper feels entitled to give advice to those who exercise that high function.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The present writer, at any rate, has long held that a great revolution in journalism-or, at least, a great step in its evolution --must yet occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Clearly the process of simply gathering the news, such as it is, has almost approached perfection; it seems impossible to carry it much further than the point which the metropolitan press has already attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>The next point attempted must certainly be that indicated by the old Scotch song, <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/></p><l>But are ye sure the news is true?</l></quote> It is inevitable that in time we should aim at quality as well as quantity; at accuracy as well as amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>The old rustic objurgation <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, <quote>Yer don't know nothina, and what yer du know yer don't know sartin,</quote> is no longer applicable in full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Nobody can now apply the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half to the daily press; but the last half is as applicable as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The larger the newspaper, the greater seems the deficiency on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>It is not a question of wilful falsehood, which is perhaps rare, but we simply see an art which has reached a certain point, and is yet to be developed further.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>I asked a very successful newspaper correspondent during the civil war why he found it necessary to describe himself as having personally witnessed <num value="2">two</num> events which had happened at the same moment <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>He answered, very frankly, that such was the general rule of his profession, since it was found that nobody cared for <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-hand information, and the public demanded that everything should be reported by an eye-witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>It is now many years since that incident, but the same rule appears yet to be maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>In no other way, at least, can <num value="1">one</num> account for the astounding minuteness and the marvellous inaccuracy of the information given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> who has occasion to look up a point of history through newspaper evidence will find that many things will forever remain absolutely <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> inscrutable from this very habit of correspondents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>It is not merely that half a dozen persons will give wholly irreconcilable accounts of <num value="1">one</num> event; that is to be expected, and if each would only say frankly that he was writing mere rumors, or the tales of <quote>an intelligent eye-witness,</quote> it might be possible to deal with them by making proper allowances; but since each claims to have personally seen the fact he describes, the case is hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>No system of averages will apply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>If <num value="1">one</num> correspondent describes a certain hero as dying at sunrise, and another pictures him as breathing his last just as the evening star shines out, you cannot adjust the matter by killing him at high noon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>But this habit of vicarious description did not disappear with the civil war; it is just as prevalent to-day in times of peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Let any <num value="1">one</num> compare the references to himself or herself in the newspapers-and who is so humble as not to appear sometimes in the society columns?-and it will become evident that they not only are often wide of the truth, but are often so diametrically opposite as to destroy each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>You are in the city and in the country on the same day; you have sailed for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and are driving in a fourhand <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> among the <rs type="place">Berkshire Hills</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>A gentleman with whom I should be well acquainted used to carry in his pocket <num value="2">two</num> scraps cut within a fortnight from <num value="2">two</num> metropolitan newspapers, the <num value="1">one</num> describing him as a man without a gray hair in his head, and the other as a man possessing a remarkably fine head of snow-white locks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Should his biography ever be written, it is a matter of chance which description will come into the record as the unimpeachable testimony of an eye-witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Even as this is written, the present writer turns to a newspaper column of personals, and finds that he is just returning from a place which he has never visited to another place where he has no intention of going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>So constant is this sort of thing that he can lay his hand on his heart and testify that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the majority of statements that are made about him in the newspapers are not only erroneous as to details, but are made out of the whole cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>On inquiry he finds it to be just the same with all his neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>The same witness already quoted receives frequently a cutting from different newspapers recently published, describing him as taking <quote>a daily spin</quote> on a tricycle to certain designated towns, with his <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> little daughter behind him, the fact being that neither of them has mounted a tricycle for years, nor did they ever visit in that way the towns specified.</p>

The present habit of the newspapers deprives us of all that innocent pleasure, since they may at any moment assign to us all these innumerable places at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/><persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0178.0012.00091.00308" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,nomatch:0"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>, who rejoiced that he was at a certain time so unimportant that he could mount his horse and ride a few miles out of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> without anybody's noticing it, would lose all that privilege were he among us, for he would very likely be reported as on horseback, whether he was there or not. In <num value="1">one</num> way this fictitious publicity, or publicity under fictitious circumstances, has its advantages, for if the newspapers sometimes report you to be where you would not have thought of going, they often do you the favor of recording you as present at some public function &mdash; a funeral, for instance --where you ought to be but are not. The friend already quoted tells me that this has <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> gradually begun to exert on him a demoralizing influence; if he attends on such an occasion, he avers, it is commonly left unmentioned; but if he fails to go, his name is apt to swell the list of persons present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Now, as on this semi-public occasion the great object is not to be there, but to be supposed to be there, the reporters secure for you that credit without exertion of your own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The curious thing is that, no matter how irresponsible are the newspaper assertions about ourselves personally, we find it impossible not to put some faith in them when they relate to other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Even when we know that we were not present, as reported, each of us assumes that everybody else was. We read the list of guests at some entertainment, and readily believe that all named as attending were actually there in the body, although we may have known a <num value="100">hundred</num> instances where such lists were taken only from some hasty list, printed or written, of invited guests, some of whom might be at the time in <placeName key="tgn,7014494" n="1.000 5" reg="seattle, kings, washington territory">Seattle</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,1000059" n="1.000 13" reg="venezuela">Venezuela</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The cruel advantage of the reporter lies always in the intrinsic impressiveness of print, the product of an art which still retains something of the solemnity that belonged to it in the days when it was held to be magical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/><pb id="p.93" n="93"/> It has its hold on the reporter himself, who often ends in not merely stoutly maintaining but actually believing his statement to be strictly true in all its parts as printed, although he knew well an hour ago in what a helterskelter way it was picked up. If these little black imps called types can thus beguile the very most experienced, how shall the ignorant escape?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>Their power is irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>You may contradict a printed statement never so often, yet nobody sees the disclaimer, and the wise soon outgrow the habit of correction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Erelong, perhaps, these despots of ours will grow humane from very mercy, and the journalist who ranks highest in his profession will not be he who presents the most facts, but the fewest falsehoods.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>A question has lately come up which lies behind all other matters involved in either the <name>Venezuelan</name> or the <name>South African</name> question, and upon which all sensible men and women should form an opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Is there, after all, any advantage in living in a republic; and is it not better, in truth, to dwell in a colony, whose final control rests in some government a few <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> off, so that the colony will be well taken care of?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>How our grandparents or great-grandparents answered this question we know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>They fought a <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> war to get rid of being a colony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>The question, however, is what we think of it now. And if an independent republic is better, does this apply in general, or only to people who speak English and are Protestants?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>Or, on the other hand, is it true of all people, at any rate of all <name>Christian</name> people, leaving others for the moment <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> out of the question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Did all Central and Southern <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, for instance, make a mistake when their successive states declared independence of various <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> nations and set up republics?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Or would it have been better had they all remained &mdash; as <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> is &mdash; under the government of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>It is very common to see just now, in religious newspapers and in letters from professors, an expression of sincere regret that the <rs>Spanish-American</rs> republics generally are not becoming colonies of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>They would, it is thought, be in that case much more happy and prosperous; would have better roads, more shops, stricter laws, would speak a more intelligible dialect, and be less superstitious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>They would have gunboats to protect them; a great many people would come from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to live among them and teach them manners; they would have pale ale; and there would always be a home government to settle questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>Would not that be better than to live in their own way and have occasional revolutions?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>It is a curious fact that, in spite of all these obvious advantages of the colonial condition, it finds least approval among the very people who ought best to know its value &mdash; the colonists <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> who go forth from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is, indeed, the only <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> nation which sends forth its children on a really enormous scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Now, these self-exiled people ought clearly, if they know what is good for them, to seek out some <name>English</name> colony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>These colonies are to be found all over the world; there is no habitable zone where a person or a family leaving <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> may not settle down and find atmosphere, food, employment, to suit every sort of taste; there is a vast and alluring assortment of colonial conditions provided always under the <rs>British</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>What is the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The result is that, according to <persName n="Dilke,Sir,Charles,,," id="n0178.0013.00099.00309" reg="default:Dilke,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Dilke</surname></persName>, <quote><num value="3">three</num> times as many natives of the <name>United Kingdom</name> are living in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as in the whole of our [British] colonies put together.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The verdict seems perfectly conclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>If, now, those born in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> itself prefer the life of the self-governing republic, why should not those also prefer it who had the misfortune to be born somewhere else-as, for instance, in <placeName key="tgn,1000059" n="1.000 13" reg="venezuela">Venezuela</placeName> or in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>This is the period when young people just coming out of college are receiving a good deal of advice, and giving some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>As it is the period when they feel oldest for themselves, and are regarded as youngest by their elders, most of the advice is superfluous, and is pretty sure not to be heeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>They are at a time when they must learn, not by the wisdom or unwisdom of others, but by their own-and particularly by their own-blunders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>They may, for instance, fall into either of <num value="2">two</num> forms of cant &mdash; that of spread-eagleism or that of cosmopolitanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Of the <num value="2">two</num>, the cant of cosmopolitanism is the worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It belongs chiefly to the untravelled, or to those who have travelled very little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>No <num value="1">one</num> is quite so cosmopolitan as the youth who, having crossed the ocean on a cattle-steamer, has found his way to <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, and has been prevented from being a little <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> wicked only by the lingering of a very few scruples and the presence of but a very few dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>The more experienced often go abroad, as <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0178.0015.00111.00334" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> said-and <persName n="Motley,,,,," id="n0178.0015.00111.00335" reg="mostcommon:Motley,nomatch:0"><surname>Motley</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0178.0015.00111.00336" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> illustrated-<quote>to be Americanized.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>That is, they learn that the nation of which they are a portion has its own career to work out; that nothing that can be learned or won in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is too good for us, but that you can no more transplant the social atmosphere of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> than you can change the climate or the sky.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>It must always be borne in mind that the range of our alleged Anglomania is not very wide nor its depth very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>It touches mainly a few points of dress and social usage, sometimes caught up foolishly for imitation, but more often wisely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Yet even among the class most charged with it the costliest things, the domestic architecture, the furniture, the internal decorations of houses, are almost all brought from the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, not from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; while we go mainly to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> for pictures and to <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> for science, very much as if <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> did not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>In all this there is properly no element of liking or disliking, but merely the natural impulse of a newer nation to go where there are the best models, and to get the most valuable things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>It is an instinct as natural as that which led <persName n="Crusoe,,Robinson,,," id="n0178.0016.00116.00352" reg="default:Crusoe,Robinson,,,"><foreName>Robinson</foreName> <surname>Crusoe</surname></persName> to visit and revisit the wrecked <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> vessel: he was not paying a compliment to the vessel; he simply desired the things on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>But it is a curious fact that men's likings are usually simpler and less perplexing than their dislikings; and this is true of our national instincts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>It is plain enough why we should like or imitate <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; but whence comes this vague and widely spread dislike of her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Why is it that our naval officers tell us that they fraternize more cordially in foreign ports with French or <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> naval officers than with <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0178.0016.00117.00353" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Undoubtedly there are many causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>But it would seem as if, in spite of all these things, blood must be thicker than water, and that even those who are not linked with <quote>the mother-country</quote> by blood must recognize some tie of language, at least at a time when it looks as if that great empire, so aggressive <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> and yet so beneficent, were about to be left to fight its battles single-handed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Possibly it would be so when it came to the point; but the most ominous thing is the fact, lying behind all the condition of affairs, that this covert antagonism is in a manner reciprocal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>It is very curious, for instance, to trace through the pages of <persName n="Arnold,,Matthew,,," id="n0178.0016.00118.00355" reg="default:Arnold,Matthew,,,"><foreName>Matthew</foreName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName>'s correspondence, just published, the traces of a profound international distrust pervading his whole life, long before he had ever planned crossing the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>A man of cold temperament, often narrow, often whimsical, but thoroughly wishing to be just, he can never even compliment an American except with an implied surprise that he should be such a wholly exceptional specimen of his kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>It is impossible to estimate how much this petty literary antagonism has done to furnish fuel for the so-called <quote>jingo</quote> side in a world where the gospel of turning the other cheek to the smiter is yet imperfectly established.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>It is such changes as this which lead men to talk, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, at the last Presidential election, of classes and masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>It is to be wished, perhaps, that <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n0178.0020.00143.00407" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName> had never introduced that undesirable phrase; but since he did, it is not strange that, like other <name>English</name> slang, it should be <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> transplanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>It does not come alone from the dissatisfied; <num value="1">one</num> of the leading American newspapers, speaking from a conservative point of view, accepts the attitude, and distributes the classes in the following way. According to this writer, the <quote>upper class</quote> in <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> consists of those whose income is above <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">$100,000</measure>; the <quote>upper middle,</quote> of incomes from <measure n="6000dollars" type="currency">$6000</measure> to <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">$100,000</measure>; the <quote>lower middle,</quote> from <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1000</measure> to <measure n="6000dollars" type="currency">$6000</measure>; while the <quote>lower class</quote> consists of those whose whole income is below <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1000</measure>. As applied, this practically keeps farmers, mechanics, and day laborers in the lower class; ordinary professional men, shopkeepers, <rs type="role" reg="head-Clerk">head clerks</rs>, judges, and Congressmen in the lower middle; the best-paid men of these pursuits in the upper middle; while the higher class includes only great speculators or mine-owners or owners of <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> or employers of labor on a large scale-or else the children and heirs of these last classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Of course the whole classification is frankly based on wealth alone, leaving birth, education, or character out of sight, except, perhaps, as recognizing that brains at least have some share in money-making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Of the golden rule there is not a hint, nor is there any recognition of the fact that in some <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> American communities these other elements still count for something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>In all college towns, for instance, education usually outranks wealth; and in some communities as <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and the <rs>Southern States</rs> generally-great-grandmothers and even cousins still represent a good deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>But as to all the newer and most of the busier parts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the classification hits pretty near home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Now we have all wished to postpone forever all talk of masses and classes in this country; but the important thing is to weigh the facts just as they are and govern ourselves accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>It has been pointed out several times in these papers that there is no essential difference, in origin, between the aristocracy of wealth and that of birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Hereditary aristocracy is simply a skilful device for perpetuating the prestige of wealth; it is a longer investment, a securer mortgage, the structure being built in stone instead of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>The rich man in this country knows that if his son loses his wealth he loses everything; the rich man in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> knows that his descendants, once ennobled, can hold their own in spite of poverty, folly, and even vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>This is a very poor result for the community, as <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> most <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0178.0020.00146.00408" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> would agree, but it is a great convenience for the family immediately concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>Nothing works better in American life than the promptness with which the degenerate scions of honored parents drop out of sight; in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> they simply marry a fortune and retain their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>As <num value="1">one</num> result, most people in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, even radical reformers, have acquired the habit of cringing more or less before hereditary rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>In <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> there is more or less jealousy of wealth, but very little cringing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>It is doubtful whether a mere aristocracy of wealth can ever create much cringing beyond its immediate village or city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>It is only an hereditary aristocracy that is sufficiently intrenched to assert such universally recognized prestige.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>It is to be remembered, however, that another pillar of hereditary aristocracyland-ownership &mdash; is easily enough created in a nation of mere wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>In the country town where this is written &mdash; a village of about a <num value="100">hundred</num> permanent families, and in local situation the highest village in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>--the main territorial ownership is steadily passing into the hands of a comparatively few <quote>city people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>There are <num value="3">three</num> men who own a <measure n="1000acres" type="area">thousand acres</measure> apiece or thereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>The farms <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> they have bought up are either abandoned or worked on shares or let out at a low rent, rarely being occupied by the original farmers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>The tendency is to substitute for the original freehold system what is practically a tenantry, with a group remaining in the village of what were once farming families, but who now obtain, by trade with the <quote>city people,</quote> or work done for them, a better living than the farms ever yielded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>All this is not the result of any tyranny or mortgage-grasping, but of simple purchase and transfer acceptable to all classes; there is the best of feeling, but it points to a vast and far-reaching change of tenure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Nothing apparently can sustain what is called in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> <quote>peasant proprietorship</quote> except those iron laws which in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> subdivide the inheritence of <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> into as many strips as there are children in a household &mdash; a method that would be utterly intolerable to the <rs>American</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>The upshot of it all is, that while our Constitution and general laws are secure, our social structure is still fluid and changing before our eyes, and our wisest advisers cannot yet tell us just what is to be the outcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>The impending changes imply some evil, and yet it seems altogether likely that they will at last take some form that will make for good.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>What are called by the high-sounding name of <quote>international marriages</quote> not only serve as material for gossip in our vast and hungry newspaper press, but also for matter of thought to those who study social tendencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The thoughts they suggest lie in the same direction with those aroused whenever a rich American buys a castle in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, or even leases a shooting preserve in <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>All these are chiefly interesting because they bear on the problem of the position and prospects of wealth in a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Nobody cares when an economical American student goes to live in <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, or a poor girl marries an impecunious Englishman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>There must be added to the affair that little flavor of splendor that comes from wealth, or it is nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>This is not mere snobbishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>There is more of genuine snobbishness in a London day than <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> in an American year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>It is largely a good-natured curiosity; and behind this lies, with the judicious, a real desire to philosophize on the future workings of American aristocracy, if such a thing there is to be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>It seems very complimentary to this country, on the whole, that the upper extremes of wealth find themselves uncomfortable here, and discover that they can get much more for their money in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>This was acutely pointed out by our best critic, <persName n="Bryce,Mister,,,," id="n0178.0021.00149.00409" reg="mostcommon:Bryce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bryce</surname></persName>, who makes the matter very clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>All American ways and methods are founded largely upon the needs of the great middle class of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Wealth in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can only buy a little more of those comforts and luxuries of which everybody has something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>But wealth in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> can buy that of which the great body have nothing-the possession of hereditary rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>When a man grows rich enough, no matter whether his wealth came by breweries or by public employment, he can fairly expect to reach the ranks of the titled classes; and thenceforward, if he plays his cards well, he may climb higher and higher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>This is a privilege wholly different in kind from anything that wealth gives in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Moreover, some of the best natural <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> instincts assist this tendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>Every parent wishes to provide for his offspring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Now riches have wings, but a place in the peerage has not. The pauper son of the millionaire is nobody, but the earl's son holds his position securely in spite of poverty, or even of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>This is a clew to much of the charm possessed by hereditary rank for rich <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00150.00410" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>; and the repeated instances of misery which have followed its pursuit always leave room for a hope that the next experiment may turn out better.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>And even apart from rank, everything in <name>English</name> society, or even that of Continental <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, gives to wealth an advantage which it may never claim here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>The vast estates, the perfectly organized service, the habit of deference, afford a sort of paradise to those who look no further than themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Even an American bishop, it is said, is not altogether free from the delight inspired, on <name>English</name> soil, by hearing himself called <quote>Me Lud.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>It is very striking to see the unanimity with which highly cultivated <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00150.00411" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>-<persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00150.00412" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ticknor,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00150.00413" reg="mostcommon:Ticknor,nomatch:0"><surname>Ticknor</surname></persName>, <persName n="Motley,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00150.00414" reg="mostcommon:Motley,nomatch:0"><surname>Motley</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00150.00415" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>, Lowell-have expressed in their diaries or letters an American reaction against these splendors, to which they were here and there admitted in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> and an involuntary feeling that, in <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00151.00416" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s phrase, a vast number of people must be housed too little in order that a few may be housed so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>But it is only the thoughtful and cultivated man who finds such drawbacks as this; while he who merely regards wealth as a personal privilege and as something to be spent wholly for his own gratification, likes naturally to be where that privilege is largest; and this is clearly in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, not in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Women, to whom the external charm of aristocratic life is greatest, and who have only lately begun to philosophize about social progress, are naturally more blinded than men to the real drawbacks of that brilliant society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>Hence the greater part of those American women who have married into the higher circles of <name>English</name> life are said to be more than English in their Tory proclivities; there is scarcely a liberal among them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Much of the criticism on <quote>international marriages</quote> is no doubt unjust &mdash; as that they carry wealth out of the country, and the like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>Supposing it to be an evil to send wealth out of the country, what difference does it make whether it is spent in paying <persName n="Worth,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00151.00417" reg="mostcommon:Worth,nomatch:0"><surname>Worth</surname></persName>'s bills at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> or in rebuilding a French chateau?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>If the great extremes of wealth are hard to reconcile <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> with republican government, as most persons think, why not send those extreme cases elsewhere, to some scene where they fit in better?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Nothing hinders the progress of new ideas, new social methods, reforms that touch the root of society, so much as those very extremes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Our worst demagogues are always the rich demagogues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>The truly dangerous trusts and combinations do not come from the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>It is really a more serious problem in social study what to do with our multimillionaires than with our paupers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>A republic can get on very well where all pay a small tax; but where an individual tax bill may pay the whole annual expenses of several towns, there the problem begins to press upon us-how to deal with such inequalities and still preserve the spirit of a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Perhaps it is as well, while we are engaged in solving this problem, to have the responsibility of the very largest fortunes transferred from time to time to communities not troubled with the dream of social equality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>Again, if it be true, as even <name>English</name> liberals sometimes tell us, that the great show-places of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> are worth what they cost to the whole community simply as public parks or pleasure-grounds, then there is no reason why <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00153.00418" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, who certainly enjoy them even more than Europeans, should not contribute their share-beyond the entering sixpence &mdash; to keep them up. Both countries were in a manner the losers, for instance, when the magnificent library at <placeName key="tgn,2179859;tgn,1014594" n="0.084 000000.1678	placename;tgn,2179859;blenheim, albemarle, virginia,Albemarle,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0124	placename;tgn,1014594;blenheim,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="blenheim, albemarle, virginia,Albemarle,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;blenheim,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Blenheim</placeName> was sold at auction to pay the debts of a spendthrift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>It must always be remembered that individual wealth among <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0178.0021.00153.00419" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> is greater in proportion than <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> wealth, because the latter is almost always encumbered with the necessity of keeping up costly establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>Much of it, no doubt, will float back to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by change of residence or international marriages, and will serve either to keep up great historic places or for much worse purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>But the problem of human civilization lies behind all this, and will perhaps transform all our notions of property itself within another <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>It is impossible for a prosperous and comfortable person to understand the point of view of the dissatisfied-whether in the case of the ordinary socialist or of <persName n="Howells,Mister,,,," id="n0178.0025.00171.00453" reg="mostcommon:Howells,William,Dean,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Howells</surname></persName>-without keeping in mind such facts as the following, which the writer happens to know pretty directly: A poor cobbler was troubled, as many men are, with an insatiable love of mechanical invention; and this was finally concentrated on a mechanism for <quote>tying and binding</quote> in connection with a <quote>reaper.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>It was for a need then very imperfectly filled, and promised great rewards if successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>He worked at it for years, impoverishing his family for it, until his wife implored him to give it up altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Getting it at last, however, into final shape, he carried it to <num value="1">one</num> of the chief establishments which manufactured reapers, and offered it for inspection and sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/><pb id="p.172" n="172"/> After a little examination it was rejected decisively as being too complicated; the inventor went home in despair, put his model away under his bench, and promised his wife to abstain from inventions thenceforward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>A few weeks or months passed, and a shabby man <num value="1">one</num> day came to the door asking to see it, and saying that he himself had invented a reaper, and it might be worth while for them to join forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>Pulling out the rejected model from under the bench, the inventor showed it, and finally sold it for a small sum to the visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>It turned out afterwards that the shabby man was an employee of the great establishment which had nominally rejected the invention, and had taken this mean way to buy it for a song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>It has since proved immensely profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>If taxed with the trick, those concerned would simply reply that business was business, and each man must look out for himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>This precise story may not be true, though it rests on good authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>That it might be true there is no question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>It is the possibility of its being true which vitiates all theories of the dignity of wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>If wealth were, as is sometimes asserted, simply the cumulative result of industry, patience, and honesty, it would not be hard to treat it with a certain reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/><pb id="p.173" n="173"/> Where <num value="1">one</num> man has grown rich by economy, energy, and skill, and another has grown or remained poor by indolence or incapacity, there wealth seems to denote qualities that claim respect, and men do not grudge the deference shown to it. It is because men of any experience all know instances to the contrary, and have watched the many examples of tricks like that applied to this poor cobbler, that they denounce all wealth as a fraud upon the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>Sow a victim, and you reap a socialist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>Yet it is so difficult to resist the prestige of success, and so easy to believe the great man to be also good, that people are not, in the individual case, very critical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>It is easy to convince <num value="1">one</num>'s self that gossip is malicious, that <num value="1">one</num> does not know all the details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>At any rate, in the next generation the facts grow wholly vague; they represent old scandal; they no more vitiate the inheritor of a fortune than the nobleman or noble lady of to-day, in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, is vitiated in reputation by the fact that the original dukedom or earldom may have been bought by the dishonor of an ancestor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>But all this, or even the fact that the privileged position is well used, does not usually propitiate the mind of the socialist <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> or even of the philosophic critic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>His question is whether the money of the so-called benefactor is to be regarded as an actual gift or as an act of restitution-giving back to the community its rightful share hitherto withheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>If these benefactors were really publicspirited-thus the malcontents reason &mdash; they would not object to an income-tax, for instance, which would put the gift in a more unequivocal form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Probably there never was a time or place where more money was spent than is devoted here and now, by rich men, for the benefit of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>The trouble is that the wealth increases in spite of it, and so does poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>Moreover, the wealth does not get the credit of what it really does.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Its occasional follies and extravagances and titled marriages are before all men's eyes; its acts of benevolence are less advertised, and not so interesting for purposes of gossip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Many men of profuse generosity are really simple and retiring in personal habits, but these are usually ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>The only American millionaire whom <num value="1">one</num> finds habitually reverenced in the more radical newspapers is <persName n="Cooper,,Peter,,," id="n0178.0025.00174.00454" reg="default:Cooper,Peter,,,"><foreName>Peter</foreName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>, and this not so much for the money he spent as for the way he spent it; and, in part, from his greenback and other theories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/><pb id="p.175" n="175"/></p> 
<p>It is impossible not to recognize that much of the distrust of wealth on the part of the poor has come from the mere increase of the figures employed to describe it; that we count by <num value="1000000">millions</num> instead of by <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and that the word multi-millionaire has become necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/><persName><foreName>Greville</foreName></persName> records, <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago, the registering of a will bequeathing the largest fortune ever known in England-over a <measure n="1000000l." type="pounds"><num value="1000000">million</num> pounds</measure>, or <measure n="5000000dollars" type="currency">five million dollars</measure>. Only that!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>It is a great step from this to the period when all the newspapers condoled with the daughters of a single American family for being limited by their father's will to <measure n="10000000dollars" type="currency">ten million dollars</measure> apiece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>There was such a general expression of sympathy that <num value="1">one</num> expected to see a proposal to take up collections for them in Sunday-schools or by penny-in-a-slot boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Since then, moreover, the maximum figure of wealth has increased so rapidly that it haunts the imagination, especially of the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>All the old theories, as that wealth would be limited, in this country, by the absence of primogeniture, or checked by cutting off the old sources of supply, such as the <name>India</name> trade-all these have vanished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Then the question recurs, for those who are poor and philosophers at the same time, what is the outcome to be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>It is <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> almost as difficult to reconcile the principles of republican society with the existence of billionaires as of dukes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Meanwhile, as to the question of outcome, the most courageous theorizers differ fundamentally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/><persName n="George,,Henry,,," id="n0178.0025.00176.00455" reg="default:George,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>George</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bellamy,,Edward,,," id="n0178.0025.00176.00456" reg="default:Bellamy,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Bellamy</surname></persName> agree as to the disease, but prescribe remedies almost absolutely opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>It is perhaps fortunate that it is so, for it gives people time to open their eyes and to think.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>In that very interesting book <hi rend="italics">The English Peasant</hi>, by <persName n="Heath,,Richard,,," id="n0178.0026.00177.00457" reg="default:Heath,Richard,,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Heath</surname></persName>, the author chooses as his starting-point the <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> century, and calls his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> chapter <quote>In worse than <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> bondage.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>He selects, as the crowning instance of the social extremes of that period, the account given by the old historian Holinshed of the <rs>Earl</rs> of <placeName reg="Leicester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050001">Leicester</placeName>'s expenses in <dateStruct value="1313--"><year reg="1313">1313</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>This earl, it seems, spent on <quote>his family and people</quote> an amount equal to the wages of <dateStruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></dateStruct> laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>But in a newspaper statement about an American multimillionaire, lately dead, it is said that he spent on <quote>his family and people</quote> about <measure n="2000dollars" type="currency">$2000</measure> a day, which is more than would be earned in many branches of industry by <dateStruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></dateStruct> laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>If this be an illustration, it would appear that all the science and art of <measure n="5centuries" type="date">five centuries</measure> have not essentially diminished the disproportion which <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> <persName n="Heath,Mister,,,," id="n0178.0026.00178.00458" reg="nearbymention:Heath,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Heath</surname></persName> calls <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>Yet there has been a period between the <num value="2">two</num> dates when no such extreme disproportion existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>In the <rs>American</rs> colonial period, for instance, or during the early days of the republic, there was nothing like this vast remoteness between poverty and wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>It all illustrates what has often been pointed out &mdash; the human life does not move in a straight line, nor yet in a circle, but in a spiral, which reproduces the old position, but on a higher plane.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>In another form we find a seeming reversion, as our society advances, towards the earlier social structure from which we thought ourselves freed forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>If there was anything which seemed distinctively American, it was the local ownership which almost universally prevailed in our farming regions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>So marked was this, that the old manor system, which prevailed along the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7013729;tgn,2453427;tgn,1124773;tgn,1124727" n="0.023 000000.9090	placename;tgn,7013729;Hudson River, United States, North and Central America,United States,North and Central America;0.023 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2453427;Little Choptank River, Dorchester, Maryland,Dorchester,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;0.023 000000.9090	placename;tgn,1124773;Huston, Monroe, Florida,Monroe,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.023 000000.9090	placename;tgn,1124727;Hudson, Georgia, United States,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Hudson River, United States, North and Central America,United States,North and Central America;Little Choptank River, Dorchester, Maryland,Dorchester,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;Huston, Monroe, Florida,Monroe,Florida,United States,North and Central America;Hudson, Georgia, United States,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Hudson</placeName>, collapsed almost of itself at last, giving way to the general demand for personal proprietorship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>But recent statistics furnished by the <orgName n="Census Bureau" type="bureau">Census Bureau</orgName> to the <orgName n="Springfield Republican" type="newspaper">Springfield <hi rend="italics">Republican</hi></orgName> show the gradual change going on in all parts of the country, by which the holdings of land are increasing, and with them the proportion of tenant occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007515" n="1.000 1232" reg="maine">Maine</placeName>, where the alteration <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> is comparatively small, the number of tenant cultivators has increased in a decade from <num value="2780">2780</num> to <num value="4731">4731</num>, while the freehold families have declined from <num value="61528">61,528</num> to <num value="57081">57,081</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 8170" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> the tenant families have increased from <num value="3100">3100</num> to <num value="5206">5206</num>, while the freehold farmers have declined from <num value="35266">35,266</num> to <num value="29370">29,370</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/><placeName reg="Iowa, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName>, in the same time, has gained <num value="3521">3521</num> <quote>owning cultivators,</quote> but has also gained more than <num value="16500">16,500</num> tenant cultivators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> reaches the climax with a loss of <num value="3844">3844</num> <quote>owning cultivators,</quote> and an increase of <num value="39906">39,906</num> tenant families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>In short, everything points towards that landlord system which we thought we had escaped, and away from that system of personal proprietorship which we thought our stronghold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>The present writer well remembers to have heard precisely this change predicted, more than <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, by that very able man <persName n="Brownson,,Orestes,A.,," id="n0178.0026.00179.00459" reg="default:Brownson,Orestes,A.,,"><foreName>Orestes</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Brownson</surname></persName>, but the remark was received almost with derision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>No <num value="1">one</num> could deride it now, however we may explain it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>In many cases, no doubt, the advent of the gentleman farmer is a positive gain to all the agriculture of the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>He has travelled and studied more, even if he has worked less; he tries experiments for others, and runs <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> risks which they would not attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>They laugh at him openly, and imitate him on the sly. They profit by his failures, and they usually have to admit that his milk and butter bring higher prices than theirs, and are worth it. But in <num value="1">one</num> respect the gentleman farmer is an insecure possession to a community; there is never any guarantee for his permanence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>He who has to make a living off his farm is anchored to it, but he to whom it is an amusement may quit it next year, and leave his land untilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>Again, the presence of the summer visitor emphasizes social differences to a degree far beyond what before existed in the rural regions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>The ladies of the summer families do not meet the villagers and the farmers' households on a basis quite so frank as that on which the men meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>They contribute unconsciously many suggestions as to new bonnets, and they may be wholly friendly and public-spirited; but, after all, the social difference is more emphasized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>The very fact that it is intangible makes it more difficult to suspend it occasionally, as is done in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> at certain harvest balls and the like, or as used to be done in our Southern States sometimes at the marriage of some privileged slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>We are steadily outgrowing the impression that wealth is a peculiarly American institution, or exerts its chief charms in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>The love of it is hardly to be called a transplanted taste, for its spell is as old as the history of the world and as wide as the earth's circumference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>Yet it is doubtful whether this would present any serious obstacle to the enterprise of modern journalism; for, indeed, no matter how often a man's biography has been written, there always seems to be a lingering expectation that he can with a little trouble get up a wholly new <num value="1">one</num>, having an entirely different set of incidents, for the latest historian.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>If a greater personal shyness exists among literary persons than in any other occupation, it probably comes from the fact that the author, and especially the poet, feels more detached from his work, when done, than is the case with anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>His work comes to him as something outside of himself, and, when it is done, his ordinary life is but the nest from which that bird of fancy has flown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>The poem comes to him; he cannot sit down and make it by an <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> effort of will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>It is strange to him that the word <quote>poet</quote> should mean <quote>maker,</quote> when his experience is that the poem, even if a poor <num value="1">one</num>, makes itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>Its production also affords a relief; and this explains the many cases where-as, in America, with <persName n="Emily Dickinson,,,,," id="n0178.0031.00210.00537" reg="mostcommon:Emily Dickinson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emily Dickinson</surname></persName> and Francis Saltus-<num value="1">one</num> may spend a whole lifetime in making verses, and yet let almost nothing be published until after death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>This explains also why their own works often seem to authors so remote and worthless; they feel as an apple-tree might feel, if it were human, towards a barrel of its own apples of last season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>When to all this is added a woman's lingering tradition of the seclusion due to her sex, it is not strange if authors of that sex hide themselves under initials or feigned names, and decline to publish autobiographies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>Her discovery was the more remarkable, as she was very deaf; and her initiation more so, as she was by no means dumb; but her husband confirmed the story, and said that she was the only woman in the world thus honored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>The clown in <quote><num value="12" type="ordinal">Twelfth</num> night</quote> tells <persName><foreName>Viola</foreName></persName> that he lives by the church, and adds by way of explanation that he lives at his house, and his house doth stand by the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>The present writer has a similar juxtaposition, and finds it in many ways advantageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>My roses and lilies in the garden-bed are safer than if they stood next to the police-office; and when on <num value="1">one</num> occasion <num value="2">two</num> boys in the street had insulted some ladies, I collared <num value="1">one</num> of them &mdash; the other running away &mdash; and took him before my reverend neighbor with much more confidence of results than if it had been his Honor the <rs>Mayor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>The result duly followed, and was quite beyond my expectation; for the next day the boy who had run away, and whom I could not possibly have identified, came to see me unescorted, and, confessing that he and he alone was the culprit, <pb id="p.231" n="231"/> asked for forgiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>The <rs type="place">Municipal Court</rs> could hardly have adjusted the matter so neatly and so promptly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>There constantly passes before me in full view a panorama of the daily life of the <rs>Roman Catholic</rs> parish-priesthood &mdash; the visits of high and low, particularly low &mdash; the arrival of hired carriages with weddings and baptismal parties &mdash; and the too profuse carriages for funerals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>Then often at <time value="12am">midnight</time> I hear the stable doors roll back and the horse's hoofs soon after crunch upon the gravel, as the faithful priests drive away on some errand of mercy; and sometimes by day, as I am cutting the grass on the lawn, a man will come straggling past and volunteer the information that his wife has persuaded him to go and take the pledge before the praste, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless him. Pledges thus taken, I am told, are almost sure to be kept, because they are given only for short periods, and perhaps renewed from time to time; the pledged man reporting at brief intervals and being kept under constant supervision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>The regular church work I cannot watch, for the building lies on the other side of the house, accessible by a covered passage; but I know that good Father--, the predecessor of the present incumbent, <pb id="p.232" n="232"/> once said to me wearily that he knew confession to be a divinely ordained ordinance, for no mere man would have put upon his fellow-men anything so hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>Knowing all this, it did not trouble me at all, but was only gratifying, when I used to hear often, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>noon</time>, the click of the billiard-balls through Father--'s open window after his <num value="2">two</num> wearisome masses; nor do I believe that he heard that click recurring, as a record against him, before the <rs>Recording Angel</rs>, in that heaven where he now deservedly dwells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>I have not heard it on earth since he went; but it is delightful to see his successors refreshing themselves some <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, after a hard week's work, with a game of hand-ball in the high brick court which they have built for that purpose behind the stable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>His Reverence, the senior priest, can outplay either of his young assistants, to say nothing of their stout hired man, who occasionally takes a hand with them; and when the game is over, and the small boys of the parish take their turn in the court, it is pleasant to see his Reverence linger and advise them where to stand and how to await the ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>It is always agreeable to see dignity so intrenched and sure in its position that it can be familiar <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> without fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>I can remember when in youth I lost my place as teacher at a boarding-school, mainly because I had given lessons in sparring to some of the older boys.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>It is impossible to think of my neighbors except as men who would do for me any act of kindness, and whom I respect with my whole heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>No doubt they wish their Church to inherit the earth, and in their secret souls expect it: what branch of the reverend clergy does not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>Nor have I been able to induce them to cast me out into outer darkness, as <num value="1">one</num> of the wicked, though I have several times called their attention to that extreme necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>On the contrary, their theory of salvation appears very elastic; they seem to regard all well-meaning persons as constructively or potentially within the pale of redemption; and my dear lamented neighbor &mdash; he of the billiard-balls &mdash; was wont to assure me that he did not worry himself about me at all. And yet it sometimes comes across the mind, after a chat with <num value="1">one</num> of them, how our whole mental attitudes are so utterly remote, the <num value="1">one</num> from the other, that it almost seems a wonder that we should meet on the same planet, to say nothing of the same street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>What <num value="2">two</num> beings can be further apart, <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.234" n="234"/> asks, than a human soul which glories in being absolutely subject to an external authority, and <num value="1">one</num> which cannot see either the need or the possibility of such an appeal?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>It is not possible to have an authority outside of <num value="1">one</num>'s own private judgment, for what can select or accept that authority save that private judgment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>How can your mental faculties possibly set up for you a tribunal which shall override themselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>They can no more do it than a stream can rise higher than its source; no more than you can build your house downward from the chimney-top; no more than you can raise yourself from the ground by tugging at your own garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>So long as you are resting on your own faculties, you must rest on them, and to imagine that you can substitute something &mdash; as an infallible church or even an infallible book does not really help you in the least, because the same reason and conscience which put it there can at any moment take it away or disregard it. Disguise it as you please, you are trusting your own powers at last, because you have nothing else to trust to; just as, no matter how thoroughly you have put yourself into a physician's hands, it is only a temporary arrangement, and nothing can take from you <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> the right or the power to disregard his prescriptions and substitute those of some other physician, or even your own.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>Many of the current objections to the <rs>Roman</rs> <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName> seem to me trivial or untenable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>It is not easy to show that it does not produce as good saints or poets or scientists as any other body of men, or that it produces more criminals when we compare, class for class, the same social grade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>Of course poverty is responsible for a great many sins, and for a still larger proportion of convictions in court, were it only for the want of bondsmen or paid counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>Therefore the church which has most of the poor will naturally have the most criminals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>I used to think, as many do, that the <rs>Roman</rs> <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName>, with all its merits, produced people less truth-telling than were elsewhere found; but was rather taken aback by the remark of a young <name>Irish</name> girl, <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> sisters whom I had seen go through college with the greatest credit and teach <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> to their priests afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>I had said something on the subject to her, she being a thoroughly candid and ingenuous soul.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>For myself, I never should be led to become a <persName n="Catholic,,Roman,,," id="n0178.0035.00236.00569" reg="default:Catholic,Roman,,,"><foreName>Roman</foreName> <surname>Catholic</surname></persName>, as many are led, by the dignity and beauty of the ritual; because even that is tame and dull compared with the impressiveness of the <orgName n="Greek Church" type="church">Greek Church</orgName>, even as <num value="1">one</num> sees it in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, with its stately, melodious, black-bearded priests, its pewless churches, and the utter reverence of its kneeling congregations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>There are, however, many points of view in which the <rs>Roman</rs> <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName> is very attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>But every church claiming infallibility, whether for a pope or for a book, is hampered by this fatal logical defect &mdash; this <quote>vicious circle,</quote> as the logicians say &mdash; that it has to employ reason and conscience to set up the very authority which is to override reason and conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>We all depend upon our private judgment at last, because we have nothing else to depend upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>To claim anything else is to practise an unconscious juggling <pb id="p.237" n="237"/> with our own minds.
