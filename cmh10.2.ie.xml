<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The taking of the <rs type="place">Little Rock</rs> arsenal produced a revulsion of feeling, which caused those who hoped to keep <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> in the <rs>Union</rs> to abandon that hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The conviction that resistance by the <rs>Southern States</rs> to the authority of the general government was inevitable, seemed to possess all minds, however doubtful many may have been of its final success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>These doubts were quickly discarded, and all concurred in the general desire for independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It is a pleasure to remember that while there were those in <placeName reg="Little Rock, Pulaski, Arkansas" key="tgn,7013897">Little Rock</placeName> who indulged in unguarded expressions, there were no bitter conflicts, and the boldest expressions of opinion, Union or Confederate, were taken good-humoredly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He did not then choose to proclaim the doctrine of coercion in direct terms, while denying the right of a State to secede, or to plainly avow his intention unqualifiedly to hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government, and collect the duties and imports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>While regarding these as duties devolving on his office, he said, that <q direct="unspecified">beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>These summary measures had the intended effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>The spirit of desertion was crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>In consequence of the virtual abdication of the civil authorities, I believed it my duty, as the only man having <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> the requisite force, to institute a government <hi rend="italics">ad interim</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>Hence, on <dateStruct value="-06-30"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="30">30th</day></dateStruct>, I proclaimed martial law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal-General">provost-marshal-general</rs> at my headquarters had command over all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>Martial law, and the regulations enforcing it, put an end to the anarchy by which the loyal population had been so long afflicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>They exercised the spirit of extortion which was torturing soldiers into desertion by starving their wives and children; they restored the credit of Confederate currency and saved the army from starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>They broke up trading with the enemy, and destroyed or removed out of his reach <num value="1000">thousands</num> of bales of cotton that selfish and venal planters were ready to sell for Federal gold; they insured the exclusion of spies, the arrest of traitors, stragglers and deserters, and the enforcement of the conscription. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>The opposition to martial law never embraced many persons other than tories, speculators and deserters. . . . Before resorting to this alternative, I not only satisfied myself that the circumstances made it necessary, but that it was demanded as a necessity by the loyal population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>During all of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, letters and petitions to that effect came to me continually.
