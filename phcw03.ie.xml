<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>In it the reader will find a concise summation of what follows in detail throughout the chapters of Volume <num value="3">III</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It is amazing to the non-military reader to find how simple was the direct cause for the tremendous results in the last year of the <rs>Civil War</rs>. It was the unification of the <rs>Federal</rs> army under <persName n="Grant,,Ulysses,S.,," id="n0108.0001.00009.00012" reg="default:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><foreName>Ulysses</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>His son, in the pages that follow, repeats the businesslike agreement with <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0108.0001.00009.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> which made possible the wielding of all the <rs>Union</rs> armies as <num value="1">one</num> mighty weapon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The structure of Volume <num value="2">II</num> reflects the <rs>Civil War</rs> situation thus changed in <dateStruct value="1864-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>No longer were battles to be fought here and there unrelated; but a definite movement was made by <quote>Grant Versus <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0108.0001.00009.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName></quote> on the <dateStruct value="-05-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, accompanied by <quote>the simultaneous movements</quote> of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0108.0001.00009.00015" reg="mostcommon:Butler,B.,F.,,:2"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0108.0001.00009.00016" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,Tecumseh,,:12"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n0108.0001.00009.00017" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,nomatch:0"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName> &mdash; all under the absolute control of the man who kept his headquarters near those of <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0108.0001.00009.00018" reg="mostcommon:Meade,George,G.,,:3"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Commander">Commander</rs> of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Against such concentrated strokes the enfeebled Confederacy could not stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Only the utter courage of leaders and soldiers innately brave, who were fighting for a cause they felt meant home no less than principle, prolonged the struggle during the tragic year ending with <dateStruct value="1865-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>. <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> </p></div1>
