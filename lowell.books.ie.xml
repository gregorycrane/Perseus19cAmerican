<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>We shall barely allude to the minor poems, full of grace and depth of mystic sentiment, and which would have given <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0232.0001.00033.00307" reg="nearbymention:Dante,Jacopo,di,,"><surname>Dante</surname></persName> a high place in the history of <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName> literature, even had he written nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>They are so abstract, however, that without the extrinsic interest of having been written by the author of the <hi rend="italics">Commedia</hi>, they would probably find few readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Attempts have been made to fix precisely the dates of the different parts, but without success, and the differences of opinion are bewildering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Foscolo has constructed an ingenious and forcible argument to show that no part of the poem was published before the author's death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The question depends somewhat on the meaning we attach to the word <q direct="unspecified">published.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>It is the same with Catholicism, with imperialism, with the scholastic philosophy; and nothing is more wonderful than the power of absorption and assimilation in this man, who could take up into himself the world that then was, and reproduce it with such cosmopolitan truth to human nature and to his own individuality, as to reduce all contemporary history to a mere comment on his vision.

And as a pilgrim who goes by a way he has never travelled, who believes every house he sees afar off to be his inn, and not finding it to be so directs his belief to another, and so from house to house till he come to the inn, so our soul forthwith on entering upon the new and never-travelled road of this life directs its eyes to the goal of its highest good, and therefore believes whatever thing it sees that seems to have in it any good to be that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>And because its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> knowledge is imperfect by reason of not being experienced nor indoctrinated, small goods seem to it great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>The reflections are natural, the expression condensed, the thought weighty, and the language worthy of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>In the prologue to his <q direct="unspecified">Masque at Court</q> he has unconsciously defined his own poetry:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/></p><l>Wherein no wild, no rude, no antic sport,</l> <l>But tender passions, motions soft and grave,</l> <l>The still spectator must expect to have.</l></quote> And indeed his verse does not snatch you away from ordinary associations and hurry you along with it as is the wont of the higher kinds of poetry, but leaves you, as it were, upon the bank watching the peaceful current and lulled by its somewhat monotonous murmur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>His best-known poem, blunderingly misprinted in all the collections, is that addressed to the <rs>Countess</rs> of <placeName reg="Cumberland, Cumbria, England" key="tgn,7011987">Cumberland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>The poets of <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> began to rain influence and to modify and refine not only style but vocabulary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>Men were discovering new worlds in more senses than <num value="1">one</num>, and the visionary finger of expectation still pointed forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>There was, as we learn from contemporary pamphlets, very much the same demand for a national literature that we have heard in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>We can trace in <persName n="Spenser,,,,," id="n0232.0002.00140.00917" reg="mostcommon:Spenser,Edmund,,,:1"><surname>Spenser</surname></persName>'s poems the gradual growth of his taste through experiment and failure to that assured self-confidence which indicates that he had at length found out the true bent of his genius,&mdash;that happiest of discoveries (and not so easy as it might seem) which puts a man in undisturbed possession of his own individuality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>Before his time the boundary between poetry and prose had not been clearly defined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>His great merit <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> lies not only in the ideal treatment with which he glorified common things and gilded them with a ray of enthusiasm, but far more in the ideal point of view which he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> revealed to his countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>He at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sought for that remoteness, which is implied in an escape from the realism of daily life, in the pastoral,&mdash; a kind of writing which, oddly enough, from its original intention as a protest in favor of naturalness, and of human as opposed to heroic sentiments, had degenerated into the most artificial of abstractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>But he was soon convinced of his error, and was not long in choosing between an unreality which pretended to be real and those everlasting realities of the mind which seem unreal only because they lie beyond the horizon of the every-day world and become visible only when the mirage of fantasy lifts them up and hangs them in an ideal atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>As in the old fairy-tales, the task which the age imposes on its poet is to weave its straw into a golden tissue; and when every device has failed, in comes the witch Imagination, and with a touch the miracle is achieved, simple as miracles always are after they are wrought.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>It was she who called forth the shyer sensibilities of his nature, and taught an originally harsh and austere imagination to surround itself with fancy and feeling, as the rock fringes itself with a sun-spray of ferns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>Born and reared in a country where the homely and familiar nestles confidingly amid the most savage and sublime forms of nature, he had experienced whatever impulses the creative faculty can receive from mountain and cloud and the voices of winds and waters, but he had known man only as an actor in fireside histories and tragedies, for which the hamlet supplied an ample stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>But it was inevitable that a genius so regulated and metrical as his, a mind which always compensated itself for its artistic radicalism by an involuntary leaning toward external respectability, should recoil from whatever was convulsionary and destructive in politics, and above all in religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>It is not merely that he has studied the <name>Elizabethans</name> and caught their turn of thought, but that he really sees things with their sovereign eye, and feels them with their electrified senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>And it is a repose always lofty and clear-aired, like that of the eagle balanced in incommunicable sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/>In him a vigorous understanding developed itself in equal measure with the divine faculty; thought emancipated itself from expression without becoming its tyrant; and music <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> and meaning floated together, accordant as swan and shadow, on the smooth element of his verse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>Without losing its sensuousness, his poetry refined itself and grew more inward, and the sensational was elevated into the typical by the control of that finer sense which underlies the senses and is the spirit of them.</p>
