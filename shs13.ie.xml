<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>How I, a regimental officer, was to be responsible for bringing on a general engagement, if I carried out these instructions, I did not very well understand; but you recollect, my comrades, that the <rs>General</rs> was very deaf, and on such occasions very impatient of explanations, so as my orders were at least clear, whatever might be the consequences, I hastened to obey them, and under his supervision his old regiment was crossed over the cut, and left him upon its adventurous expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>We had advanced but a little distance, however, and had not reached the point at which the volleys were to be given and the charge with the bayonet made, when, interrupting the programme thus marked out for us, <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> our enemies took the initiative without waiting our compliments, but intent it seemed on gratifying our inquisitiveness, opened on us quite a severe fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The ground over which we were advancing was thickly wooded and covered with underbrush, so that we could see but a few paces in our front; and here, too, it sloped both to the front and flanks; from the hollow, at the bottom of the slope, the enemy poured into the regiment a destructive fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The messenger had scarcely gone when a fire was opened upon us from our right and rear, as well as from the left, and finding both flanks endangered, and the enemy in such force, I sent <persName n="Shooter,Captain,,,," id="n0270.0002.00017.00151" reg="mostcommon:Shooter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shooter</surname></persName>, the next in command in the regiment, to explain to <persName n="Gregg,General,,,," id="n0270.0002.00017.00152" reg="mostcommon:Gregg,Maxey,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gregg</surname></persName> our critical condition, and to ask for support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The fire increased rapidly, and finding the position becoming more and more untenable, I determined to extricate the regiment, if I could, without waiting for the assistance I had asked, as I feared if I waited much longer that it would be too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/></p> 
<p>There are some puzzling circumstances connected with the supposed miscarriage of the order for our advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>The delay in sending it is unexplained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The messenger was strangely chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>It was the most important order of the day, for the movements of the army were to hinge on those of our brigade.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>His instructions were peculiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Time was all-important.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>He was never heard of after receiving the order, yet his route lay wholly within our lines, over well-beaten roads and far out of reach of the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>On Tuesday the whites proceeded to Rousis's bridges, the original scene of the troubles, where they met the <rs>Federal</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>The bridge had been torn up by the negroes, and they occupied the swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>At the approach of the whites they fired and retired into the swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>The whites then appealed to the troops to disperse the armed negroes, who had waylaid and killed men in the night, burnt property and threatened the lives of women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>On the assurance that this would be done, they returned to their homes, leaving the settlement of the riot to the discretion of the <rs>Federal</rs> officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Such is the plain unvarnished statement of facts given in the order in which they occurred, without effort to create an impression against either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>This statement does not tell how rapidly the negroes could assemble, how the whole county was like a movable camp; how, at the tap of a drum or the blowing of a horn, negroes would instantly be under arms&mdash;arms which had been given by <persName n="Scott,Governor,,,," id="n0270.0005.00049.00640" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> to his favorite militia; it does not tell how terror prevailed over the whole country; how old men, women and children were sent to certain places where they might be protected from the threatened <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> violence of a body of negroes who acknowledged no law, and who undertook to avenge the shooting of <num value="1">one</num> of their color, whose crime was something very near to assassination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Let it be always borne in mind that, right or wrong, the impression was as deeply seated as it was universal, that nothing was so eagerly desired by the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> as a tale of outrage and violence towards negroes, and that nothing was so studiously avoided as any act which could give a foundation for such tales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>We shall see further on that a high official signalized his devotion to his party by the facility with which he tortured this riot into a seething mass of Democratic wrong, outrages and folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>When the unprovoked assault was made on the defenceless <persName n="Hardy,Mrs.,,,," id="n0270.0005.00050.00641" reg="mostcommon:Hardy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hardy</surname></persName> and her son, the action of her neighbors in searching for the miscreants was but a spontaneous movement of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>After <num value="1">one</num> of them was captured and identified, his captors were so far from doing him violence, that he actually made his escape; and if he was shot as he ran away, there was nothing in that act which could be tortured into violence to effect a political end. The ostensible object of the gathering of the negroes was to avenge this shooting, and every act which they performed was not only unlawful, but aggressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>If they were out in arms to commit violence, it was the simplest act of self-preservation in the whites to take up arms to resist them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>They might have made havoc among the negroes; they refrained from every act of violence, except when absolutely necessary, and at last gladly hailed the presence of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, who appeared on the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> day, and left the settlement of the disturbance to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>This spirit of forbearance characterized every step of the whites throughout this terrible summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>It permitted the negro to derange the whole labor system of the rice fields; it stayed the arm of the whites when a mob of negroes held the city of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and had shed the blood of <num value="1">one</num> of her citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>It was no less strong during the <name>Elberton</name> riots; it was peaceful to the end, and it ultimately triumphed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>I do not know whether the <rs>Governor</rs> on this occasion resorted to his usual remedy of sending a trusty and confidential agent to inquire, pacify and report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>The troops of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The sheriff played into the hands of the <name>Radicals</name> by the following dispatch to the <rs>Governor</rs>, <dateStruct value="-09-19"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="19">19</day></dateStruct>:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The whites were all under <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> arms, and reinforcements arriving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>I was powerless to disband them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>This dispatch was calculated to produce the impression that the assembling of armed whites was causeless, as no negroes under arms were either seen or heard of. When this dispatch was made public, a reply to it was made by those gentleman who had accompanied the sheriff, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was his nephew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>These gentlemen charge that the sheriff's report is false, or at least unfair, and of a partisan character: <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>It is not true that he had returned from the scene of the riot, for he had not gone within <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> of it. <num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>It is not true that he was powerless to disband the white troops, for he had made no attempt to do so. <num value="3">3</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>And <num value="4">4</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>It was not true that he heard of no negroes under arms, because those who were with him heard of them, and he must have heard the same riots.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Whether true or false, the sheriff's dispatch proved a condition of affairs about <persName n="Aiken,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00051.00643" reg="mostcommon:Aiken,nomatch:0"><surname>Aiken</surname></persName> so alarming as to demand the attention of the <rs>Governor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>How did he show his sense of responsibility?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>The Governor, he said, ought to make personal efforts to save the lives of the people over whom he presided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>The Governor's engagements in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> were of more importance than the peace of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>When the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Several lives had been lost, which ought to have been inquired into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>On reading it we shall find that <persName n="Corbin,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00052.00648" reg="mostcommon:Corbin,nomatch:0"><surname>Corbin</surname></persName> does not come up to the character of a witness, it is a mere matter of hearsay information and belief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>He begins by saying, that he had spent <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> in <placeName reg="Aiken, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095227">Aiken</placeName>, where he took affidavits of a considerable number of persons from different parts of the county, but he does not mention the names of any of these parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>He asserts (what no <num value="1">one</num> denied) that Rifle clubs exist throughout the county, armed with the best and most approved weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>These clubs, he says, have created, and still create a reign of terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Colored men, through fear of them, were living out of doors, away from their homes at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Many of them were killed by these clubs, and others were taken out of their beds and whipped; and many colored men had told him that their only security from death or whipping, was to pledge themselves to vote the <rs>Democratic</rs> ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>He continues&mdash;From the best information I could get while in <placeName reg="Aiken, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095227">Aiken</placeName>, the number of men killed by the clubs in <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> was certainly <num value="13">thirteen</num>, and probably <num value="30">thirty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>The civil arm is powerless to prevent these atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>The sheriff dare not, for fear of his life, arrest any of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>He did not go within <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> of the <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men assembled at Rousis's bridge, commanded by <persName n="Butler,,A.,P.,," id="n0270.0005.00052.00649" reg="default:Butler,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, and marching upon a crowd of negroes, whom they had surrounded, and intended, <hi rend="italics">as some allege</hi>, to kill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>It is the <rs>Governor</rs>'s duty to put down this state of things.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Now, it is disgraceful to a civilized State, that reports, so basely framed, should be made the basis of a call on the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for military assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>It was more than a fortnight since the county was quiet before <persName n="Corbin,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00052.00650" reg="mostcommon:Corbin,nomatch:0"><surname>Corbin</surname></persName> made his appearance on the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>It is certain, therefore, that his visit was expected and that proper witnesses went to <persName n="Aiken,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00052.00653" reg="mostcommon:Aiken,nomatch:0"><surname>Aiken</surname></persName> to meet him with their tales of outrage; and in this part of the report he betrays the true end of his visit, viz: to get up a story of intimidation of free voters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>The report of the number of persons killed is perfectly disgraceful if we consider it as coming from an official; from the best information he could get, certainly <num value="13">thirteen</num> and probably <num value="30">thirty</num> men had been killed in <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, and the civil arm was powerless to prevent these atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>This is fearfully true, but it was the blacks, not the clubs, that had successfully set the civil arm at defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>That <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> black men had been killed during the riots is true, but as they were aggressors <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> no notice was taken of it; but if <num value="13">thirteen</num> men had been killed, as <persName n="Corbin,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00053.00654" reg="mostcommon:Corbin,nomatch:0"><surname>Corbin</surname></persName> described, could any <num value="1">one</num> doubt but that their names would have been heralded all over the country as the victims of Democratic ferocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The very fact that none such were so heralded is conclusive proof that there were no such victims, and no <num value="1">one</num> knew that better than <persName n="Corbin,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00053.00655" reg="mostcommon:Corbin,nomatch:0"><surname>Corbin</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Lastly, he says, that white men, <num value="800">eight hundred</num> in number, had surrounded a crowd of negroes, and, <hi rend="italics">as some allege</hi>, intended to kill them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>What is the meaning of this hesitating phrase, as some allege?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>When the boat reached <placeName key="tgn,2096876" n="1.000 2" reg="wando, berkeley, south carolina">Cainhoy</placeName>, <persName n="Bowen,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00058.00700" reg="mostcommon:Bowen,John,S.,,:1"><surname>Bowen</surname></persName> went on ahead of the rest to organize the meeting, for the mass consisted of his adherents; the rest followed leisurely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>After the meeting was organized, the speaking began with <persName n="Leroy,Mister,W.,S.,," id="n0270.0005.00058.00701" reg="default:Leroy,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Leroy</surname></persName>, who was followed by a colored Radical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Some young men, not curious about the business of the meeting, strolled about, and entered a building which had once been used as a kitchen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>In the chimney of this building they saw several muskets piled, and took them out. Instantly a cry was raised, they are going to kill you, and a large body of negroes ran to a thicket which covered a small stream, took thence rifles which had been concealed there, and began a fierce fusillade upon the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>These had no weapons but their pistols, and many were entirely unarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>To make an aggressive demonstration under the circumstances would have been more than useless, and all that the most prudent could do was to make their retreat as safe as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Several men were wounded, and when the party reached <placeName key="tgn,2096876" n="1.000 2" reg="wando, berkeley, south carolina">Cainhoy</placeName>, it was found that <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> had been left behind, of whose fate nothing was known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>The boat returned to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and a detachment of the <name>Rifle</name> clubs instantly sent back to <placeName key="tgn,2096876" n="1.000 2" reg="wando, berkeley, south carolina">Cainhoy</placeName> to protect the village from a probable attack by the enraged negroes, and to bring back those who had been missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>No attack was made on the village, but at the scene of the meeting were found the bodies of some gentlemen shockingly mutilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>These were sent on to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and it is significant of the state of feeling among the negroes of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> who crowded the wharf to await the return of the boat, that they greeted the biers on which were the bodies of the murdered men with hisses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>It was afterwards ascertained that when <persName n="Bowen,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00058.00702" reg="mostcommon:Bowen,John,S.,,:1"><surname>Bowen</surname></persName> went ahead and found, on reaching the place of meeting, that a large number of men were armed with rifles, he directed them to be concealed, as the whites who were expected did not have arms and expected to find them also unarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The rifles were accordingly put out of sight so that they might be recovered at a moment's notice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>The fact that some young men on finding the muskets, which had been concealed in the chimney, had handled them, and this gives a pretext for the outbreak, gave the <name>Radicals</name> a color to represent this as an assault of Democrats on the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/><persName n="Bowen,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00058.00703" reg="mostcommon:Bowen,John,S.,,:1"><surname>Bowen</surname></persName> accordingly telegraphed to the <rs>Governor</rs> as follows: <q direct="unspecified">A fight, during a joint discussion <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> at <placeName key="tgn,2096876" n="1.000 2" reg="wando, berkeley, south carolina">Cainhoy</placeName>, was originated by a portion of the <name>Democrats</name> from the city attacking the meeting and killing an old colored man. This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot, afterwards a general row ensued.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/></p> 
<p>This is an extraordinary dispatch, and a little examination must convince any <num value="1">one</num> that it does not tell the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>That a few young men, unarmed, straying from their friends, like themselves unarmed, should wantonly fire upon a meeting consisting largely of their friends, that they should begin the mad attack by killing an old negro man, is a supposition so monstrous as to require positive proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Had they wished to kill any <num value="1">one</num> there was much higher game within their reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>The story is contradicted by every witness who was examined at the inquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>The old negro was the only negro who suffered, and he was killed in the <hi rend="italics">melee</hi> probably by his own friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Indeed, it is likely that these muskets, old and nearly useless, were purposely placed where they were found, in the hope that they would be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>The weapons which had been concealed, and which were so readily brought out, were effective rifles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>The coroner's jury sat to investigate this Democratic riot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>The solicitor of the county, <persName n="Butts,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00059.00704" reg="mostcommon:Butts,nomatch:0"><surname>Butts</surname></persName>, made himself very busy at the inquest, installed himself as chief examiner, dictated what answers should be recorded, browbeat the members of the inquest, who would from time to time put questions, and as far as he possibly could dictated the answers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>His arts were of no avail; he could extort nothing from his witnesses to bring in a verdict against the <name>Democrats</name>; and where a witness bore hardly upon the <name>Radicals</name>, he would stop him by declaring that the inquest had had enough of such stuff, and did not want any more of it. The coroner s inquest could bring no charge against the white people, and thus put the seal of condemnation upon <orgName n="partisan"><persName n="Bowen,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00059.00705" reg="mostcommon:Bowen,John,S.,,:1"><surname>Bowen</surname></persName>'s partisan</orgName> dispatch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Meanwhile the village of <placeName reg="Wando, Berkeley, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096876">Cainhoy</placeName> was guarded by the detachments from the rifle clubs, until the arrival of a portion of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>They were accompanied by <persName n="Wallace,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00059.00706" reg="nearbymention:Wallace,W.,H.,,"><surname>Wallace</surname></persName>, the marshal, who took care to suggest to the officers in command that the armed men who joyfully went there and who were congratulating themselves on being thus relieved, were members of the dreadful Rifle clubs which the <rs>President</rs> had ordered to be disbanded, and that, perhaps, it would be right to proceed against them for disobedience to the proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>But the commander had good sense as well as good feeling, recognized the supremacy of the great law of selfpreserva-tion, and exchanged military as well as civil courtesies, with the gentlemen whom he had gone to relieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/><pb id="p.60" n="60"/></p> 
<p>The <placeName key="tgn,2096876" n="1.000 2" reg="wando, berkeley, south carolina">Cainhoy</placeName> massacre, though humiliating, furnished another proof of the self-control exercised by the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>It was an unprovoked, a brutal and an outrageous assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>It would have justified, as it deserved, the most signal retribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>The Rifle clubs which proceeded that same evening to the scene, had it in their power to strike a blow which would have been remembered for years, and the moral sense of no people in christendom would have condemned them had they done so. But they did not; they went with words of peace; they gave their protection to the village which lay exposed to the insults and assaults of the savage mob, and they quietly and gladly gave way to the troops who came on the same mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>This moderation was not understood by the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>They supposed it was the result of fear, and the glorious day of <placeName key="tgn,2096876" n="1.000 2" reg="wando, berkeley, south carolina">Cainhoy</placeName> and the defeat of the whites was celebrated by them in songs and dances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Day by day their tone became more aggressive, day by day the imbecility of <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00060.00707" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName>'s government, and the partisan tyranny of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00060.00708" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s, more offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>On the <dateStruct value="-11-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> the election was held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>In <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, long before <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time>, a mob, accompanied by the beat of a drum, gave tumultuous notice of the election, and by <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> the polls were thronged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>All day there was the most intense excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>Every poll was attended by brutal looking negroes, who, decorated with ribands, proclaimed themselves the special deputies of the sheriffs, armed with clubs, and ostensibly keepers of the peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Scarcely less repulsive in appearance were the deputies of the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>At every poll were the gentlemen of the precinct, who, without distinction of age, profession, or condition, went there to assist by their moral influence to preserve the peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>About the polls, too, were numbers of negro women decorated with <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00060.00710" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> badges, giving encouragement to their darkey brethren and ready to join in and add to the horrors of a riot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>The day passed off quietly in the city, but it was evident from the very large number of votes polled that hundreds of illegal votes had <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> been cast; large numbers of negro Democrats had been intimidated and declined to vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>At the county polls the negroes went armed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>As the votes were counted in the night immediately after closing the polls, the telegraph was all the next day reporting the state of the polls, and we were soon persuaded that <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00061.00711" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:4"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> was elected Governor and <persName n="President,,Tilden,,," id="n0270.0005.00061.00712" reg="default:President,Tilden,,,"><foreName>Tilden</foreName> <surname>President</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Of course the exultation of the whites was great, and the disappointment of the blacks commensurate with the hopes which they had entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>Disorder was common in the streets all day, but in the afternoon it culminated in a fearful riot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>How it arose no <num value="1">one</num> could explain, but it seems to have been occasioned by the discharge (perhaps accidental) of a pistol near the east end of <address><street n="Broad street">Broad street</street></address>. The crowd was dense and several shots were fired with no damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>But the excitement spread, and the crowd at the courthouse recklessly fired upon passengers in the street who were quietly going to their places of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>The mob assailed every white man who passed there; made furious demands at the station house for arms, and failing to obtain them tore up trees, palings, fences, to furnish themselves with the means of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>The police was turned out to quell the riot, but failed to do anything but to arrest whites who were in the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>True to the character of the negro riots, it was everywhere at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>It began on <address><street n="Broad street">Broad street</street></address>, but there was a riot at every corner, and every white man was in danger of insult if not of violence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>Notwithstanding the president's proclamation, the members of the <name>Rifle</name> clubs went to the station house with their weapons to offer to assist in restoring peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>The next day there was a feverish uneasiness all over town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>The telegraph was incessantly reporting news of the election, and the <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> bulletin boards of the newspapers were crowded with anxious men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>The Democrats believed that <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00062.00729" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:4"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> was elected by a majority of about <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> votes; that a majority of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> had been elected, and that on a joint ballot of the two Houses they would have a majority of <num value="1">one</num> vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>It was now asserted that <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00062.00730" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> had received a majority of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3000">three thousand</num> votes, and so large a number of representatives as to give the <name>Radicals</name> a majority on joint <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> ballot of about <num value="20">twenty</num> votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>On what was this expectation grounded?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>In all the <rs>Southern States</rs> in which the negroes had a majority, an expedient was devised for perpetuating this power, which made all elections a mockery and a nullity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>In this State it was a Board of Canvassers, consisting of the principal officers of the <rs>State</rs>, to whom the returns of the elections were made, who canvassed the returns and determined the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>They were authorized to throw out votes which they deemed illegal or improper; in fine, to do anything to keep the power in their own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>No man could be sure of his election, even though he had received a unanimous vote; for this omnipotent board, for reasons satisfactory to themselves, might decide that the whole election was irregular and consequently void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>A board of such enormous power, composed of men of principles, more than doubtful, required watching, and <persName n="Conner,General,,,," id="n0270.0005.00063.00731" reg="mostcommon:Conner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Conner</surname></persName>, and other eminent lawyers, went to <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> to watch their proceedings and take care of the interests of the <name>Democrats</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point made was, that as a majority of this Board, the treasurer, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">secretary of State</rs>, and another, were candidates for election, they could not sit in judgment on their own cases, and consequently the board was incompetent to act. It must be remembered that by law every ballot contained on a single piece of paper the names of all, the persons balloted for, so that it was impossible to canvass any <num value="1">one</num> name on the paper without canvassing all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>This was an expedient that, under the circumstances, could proceed only from a knave or a fool.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>But an order from the <rs>President</rs> deserves at least the respect of an examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Let us briefly do so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>In the first place, why the gratuitous assertion that <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00065.00745" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> was, at that time, the actual Governor of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>It was neither doubted nor denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>It was only himself who seemed by his imbecility and his utter dependence upon Federal troops to doubt it. His enemies had elected the man of their choice, and were content to wait patiently for the time when he would lawfully assume his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>In the second place, <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00065.00746" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> had <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure> before called in the aid of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops and these troops were still there in pursuance of the call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Whence, then, this new order?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>In the third place, though not expressed in the order, it was really given in view of the approaching session of the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>If <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00065.00747" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was really desirous of doing his duty under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, he would have let things remain in <hi rend="italics">status quo</hi>, until the <name>Legislature</name>, which was about to meet, should advise him what he ought to do, but this would not have suited the views of the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>He speaks of the duty of the <rs>Government</rs> to aid in maintaining a Republican Government in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>Could the <rs>President</rs> have meant that inasmuch as <num value="1">one</num> party called itself Republican and the other Democratic, his duty called him to aid the former to the exclusion of the latter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>This supposition is an insult to his understanding, but even so, more favorable to his character than the gross tyranny of the order by which he <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> proposed to destroy all republican government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>They thus changed the balance of power by usurping a function which the <rs>Constitution</rs> gives exclusively to the several branches of the <name>Legislature</name>, and the dictum of these few men was to overrule the voice of the <rs>State</rs>; and this was the <rs>Republican Government</rs> which the <rs>President</rs> ordered his soldiers to defend.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>The troops were ordered to protect <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00066.00749" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> against Democratic violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>The party of violence was the <name>Radical</name> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>All this violence, all this intimidation was for the purpose of keeping in office a man who knew that he was utterly repudiated by the people, and could not sustain himself <num value="1">one</num> hour without the aid of Federal bayonets; and this was what <persName n="Grant,President,,,," id="n0270.0005.00066.00751" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> called sustaining Republican government in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>The Board obtained a temporary triumph by the officious intervention of <persName n="Bond,Judge,,,," id="n0270.0005.00085.00894" reg="mostcommon:Bond,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Bond</surname></persName>; but this interference did not in any degree shake the advantage which the lawyers had gained, and served only to bring into utter contempt the whole machinery of Returning Boards, and to bring the judge into the condition of a <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> convenient minister of a partisan government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>During all the exciting scenes which were enacted in the court rooms, a large body of eager citizens were without impatiently waiting for the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>A word from the great leader would have embroiled the country in civil strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>That word was not spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>On the contrary he counselled peace, moderation, forbearance, and led his friends to hope that through these means their cause would surely prevail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>It was the hope of the <name>Radicals</name> that the exasperated citizens would commit violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>The <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>That complaint he never had a cause to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>Day by day he saw his hopes slipping away from him, but there was no violence employed to effect that object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>It was the moral force alone that had undermined, but no military force could help him here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>The people gave their money to <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00086.00896" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:4"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, and would give none to the occupant of the <rs type="place">State House</rs>; but this refusal was without violence, nay, so conscious were his officers of the hopelessness of his cause, that they never even called for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>The judges, all of whom had been appointed by Radical legislatures, <num value="1">one</num> after another acknowledged the right of <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00086.00897" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:4"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>; <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00086.00898" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> at last found that his government was limited to the forced possession of the <rs type="place">State House</rs>, and never had a shadow of a ground of violence to warrant a call on the army for support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>Nor were provocations wanting to goad on a maddened people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>When <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00086.00899" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> ordered that no white soldiers should take a part in the customary celebration of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>'s birth-day, what object could he have had in view but that an indignant people would disobey the order, and thus by giving color for interference, provoke a collision which would injure the cause?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>And with what admirable temper did the <rs>Governor</rs> meet this outrageous order!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>He sent his orders all over the <rs>State</rs>, directing that the order of the <rs>President</rs> be obeyed, and held out hopes of a celebration at an early day when it would not be a crime for citizens of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to celebrate the birthday of the father of their country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>If the final victory was due to the lawyers, it is no less due to the great wisdom of the accomplished Governor and leader of his party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>Calm, cautious, prudent and hopeful, he never made a false step; never for a moment, even in appearance, yielded a tittle of what he had gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>In the history of his past life <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0270.0005.00086.00900" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> had been <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> known as a brilliant, chivalrous and accomplished gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>In the great contest for the redemption of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> he showed himself to be a great man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>In this essay, I have necessarily been obliged to omit many radical crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>I could not name them all without going to inordinate length, and I could not do justice to the subject without going even into details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>Wherever I have undertaken to make a narration, I am not conscious of having done any injury either to <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0270.0005.00087.00901" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> or the party that he represents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>The period under consideration is the darkest which ever hung over us; more trying even than when the issue was to be decided by battle, and the story can be well told only by laying bare its atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>It is apparent that the specious man who contrived not only to elevate himself to power, but for a time even to win the approbation of the <name>Democrats</name>, and who was regarded by the <rs>North</rs> as the redeeming feature in the dark picture of Southern Radicalism was a charlatan and a trickster, that having gained power by corruption he sought to gild it with the hollow pretence of a Reformer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>He was a charlatan, but he had nothing but the address of the charlatan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>He never expressed himself when the character of the <rs>State</rs> was seriously compromised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>He had not the courage to face danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>He shut himself up in his house to enjoy domestic felicity when danger came, or he ran to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to implore the aid of Federal bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>He wrote admirable papers on law and morals; his proclamations were splendid rhetorical essays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>He was great in college orations, but as a Governor he was contemptible.</p></div1></body></text> </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>The Congress being nearest the <rs>Merrimac</rs> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to receive her fire, which was promptly returned by a full broadside, the shots falling apparently harmlessly off from the armored side of the assailant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>Passing by the <rs>Congress</rs>, the <rs>Merrimac</rs> dashed upon the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, and was received by her with a heavy, well directed, and vigorous fire, which, like that of the <rs>Congress</rs>, produced, unfortunately, but little effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>A contest so unequal could not be of long continuance, and it was closed when the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, availing herself of her power as a steam ram, ran furiously against the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, laying open her wooden hull, and causing her almost immediately to sink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>As her guns approached the water's edge, her young commander, <persName n="Morris,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0007.00093.00914" reg="mostcommon:Morris,Gouveneur,,,:2"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Morris</surname></persName>, and the gallant crew stood firm at their posts delivering a parting fire, and the good ship went down heroically with her colors flying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>Having thus destroyed the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, the <rs>Merrimac</rs> turned again upon the <rs>Congress</rs>, which, in the meantime, had been engaged with the smaller rebel steamers, and after a heavy loss, in order to guard against such a fate as that which had befallen the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, had been run aground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>The <rs>Merrimac</rs> now selected a raking position astern of the <rs>Congress</rs>, while <num value="1">one</num> of the smaller steamers poured in a constant fire on her starboard quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>Her decks were strewn with the dead and the dying, the ship was on fire in several places, and not a gun could be brought to bear upon the assailants.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>In this state of things, and with no effectual relief at hand, the senior surviving officer, <persName n="Pendergrast,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0007.00094.00916" reg="mostcommon:Pendergrast,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Pendergrast</surname></persName>, felt it his duty to save further useless destruction of life by hauling down his colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>This was done about <time value="4pm">4 o'clock P. M.</time> The Congress continued to burn until about <time value="8pm">eight in the evening</time>, then blew up.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>From the <rs>Congress</rs> the <rs>Merrimac</rs> turned her attention to the remaining vessels of the squadron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>The <rs>Roanoke</rs> had grounded on her way to the scene of the conflict; and although she succeeded in getting off, her condition was such, her propeller being useless, that she took no part in the action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>The St. Lawrence also grounded near the <rs>Minnesota</rs>, and had a short engagement with the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, but suffered no serious injury, and on getting afloat, was ordered back to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>The <rs>Minnesota</rs>, which had also got grounded in the shallow waters of the channel, became the special object of attack, and the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, with the <rs>Yorktown</rs> and <rs>Jamestown</rs>, bore down upon her. The <rs>Merrimac</rs> drew too much water to approach very near; her fire was not, therefore, particularly effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>The other steamers selected their position, fired with much accuracy, and caused considerable damage to the <rs>Minnesota</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>She soon, however, succeeded in getting a gun to bear on the <num value="2">two</num> smaller steamers, and drove them away, <num value="1">one</num> apparently in a crippled condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>About <time value="7pm">7 P. M.</time> the <rs>Merrimac</rs> also hauled off, and the <num value="3">three</num> stood towards <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>All efforts to get the <rs>Minnesota</rs> afloat during the night and into a safe position were totally unavailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>The morning was looked for with deep anxiety, as it would, in all probability, bring a renewed attack from the formidable assailant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>At this critical and anxious moment the <rs>Monitor</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of the newly-finished armored vessels, came into <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> from New York, under the command of <persName n="John,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0007.00094.00917" reg="mostcommon:John,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>John</surname></persName> L <persName n="Worden,,,,," id="n0270.0007.00094.00918" reg="nearbymention:Worden,John,L.,,"><surname>Worden</surname></persName>, and a little after <time value="12am">midnight</time> anchored alongside the <rs>Minnesota</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>At <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> the next morning the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, as anticipated, again made appearance and opened her fire upon the <rs>Minnesota</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>Promptly obeying the signal to attack, the <rs>Monitor</rs> ran down past the <rs>Minnesota</rs> and laid herself close alongside the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, between that formidable vessel and the <rs>Minnesota</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>The fierce conflict between these <num value="2">two</num> iron-clads lasted for several hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>It was, in appearance, an unequal conflict, for the <rs>Merrimac</rs> was a large and noble structure, and the <rs>Monitor</rs> was, in comparison, almost diminutive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>But the <rs>Monitor</rs> was strong in her armor, in the ingenious novelty of her construction, in the large caliber of her <num value="2">two</num> guns, and the valor and skill with which she was handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>After several hours fighting the <rs>Merrimac</rs> found herself overmatched, and, leaving the <rs>Monitor</rs>, sought to renew the attack on the <rs>Minnesota</rs>; but the <rs>Monitor</rs> again placed herself between the <num value="2">two</num> vessels, and reopened her fire upon her adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>At <time value="12pm">noon</time>, <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, seriously damaged, abandoned the contest, and, with her companions, retreated towards <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>This terminated the most remarkable naval combat of modern times, perhaps of any age.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>When within less than a mile of the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, the <rs>Virginia</rs> commenced the engagement with that ship with her bowgun, and the action soon became general, the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, Congress, gunboats, and shore batteries concentrating upon us their heavy fire, which was returned with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name> and determination.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>The Virginia stood rapidly on towards the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, which ship I had determined to sink with our prow, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>In about <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> after the action commenced, we ran into her, on her starboard bow; the crash below the water was distinctly heard, and she commenced sinking, gallantly fighting her guns as long as they were above water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>She went down with her colors flying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>During this time the shore batteries, Congress, and gunboats kept up their heavy concentrated fire upon us, doing us some injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>Our guns, however, were not idle; their fire was very destructive to the shore batteries and vessels, and we were gallantly sustained by the rest of the squadron.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>Just after the <rs>Cumberland</rs> sunk, that gallant officer, <persName n="Tucker,Commander,John,R.,," id="n0270.0007.00097.00934" reg="default:Tucker,John,R.,,"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName>, was seen standing down <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> under full steam, accompanied by the <rs>Jamestown</rs> and <rs>Teaser</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>They all came nobly into action, and were soon exposed to the heavy fire of shore batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>Their escape was miraculous, as they were under a galling fire of solid shot, shell, grape, and canister, a number of which passed through the vessels, without doing any serious injury, except to the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs>, through whose boiler a shot passed, scalding to death <num value="4">four</num> persons and wounding others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>As soon as damages were repaired, the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> returned to her station, and continued to perform good service during the remainder of that day and the following.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>Having sunk the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, I turned our attention to the <rs>Congress</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>We were some time in getting our proper position in consequence of the shoal water and great difficulty of managing the ship when in or near the mud; to succeed in my object, I was obliged to run the ship a short distance above the batteries on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, in order to wind her. During all this time her keel was in the mud; of course she moved but slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>Thus we were subjected twice to the heavy guns of all the batteries in passing up and down the river, but it could not be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>We silenced several of the batteries and did much injury on shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>A large transport steamer alongside the wharf was blown up, <num value="1">one</num> schooner sunk, and another captured and sent to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>The loss of life on shore we have no means of ascertaining.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>While the <rs>Virginia</rs> was thus engaged in getting her position for attacking the <rs>Congress</rs>, the prisoners state it was believed on board that ship that we had hauled off; the men left their guns and gave <num value="3">three</num> cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>They were soon sadly disappointed, for a few minutes afterwards we opened upon her again, she having run on shore in shoal water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>The carnage, havoc, and dismay caused by our fire compelled them to haul down their colors and to hoist a white flag at their gaff and half mast another at their main.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>The crew instantly took to their boats and landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>Our fire immediately ceased, and a signal was made for the <rs>Beaufort</rs> to come within hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>I then ordered <persName n="Parker,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0270.0007.00097.00936" reg="nearbymention:Parker,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> to take possession of the <rs>Congress</rs>, secure the officers as prisoners and allow the crew to land, and burn the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>He ran alongside, received her flag and surrender from <persName n="Smith,Commander,William,,," id="n0270.0007.00097.00937" reg="default:Smith,William,,,"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pendergrast,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0007.00097.00938" reg="mostcommon:Pendergrast,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Pendergrast</surname></persName>, with the side arms of these officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>They delivered themselves as prisoners <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> of war on board the <rs type="ship">Beaufort</rs>, and afterwards were permitted, at their own request, to return to the <rs>Congress</rs> to assist in removing the wounded to the <rs>Beaufort</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>They never returned, and I submit to the decision of the <name>Department</name> whether they are not our prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>While the <rs>Beaufort</rs> and <rs>Raleigh</rs> were alongside the <rs>Congress</rs>, and the surrender of that vessel had been received from the commander, she having <num value="2">two</num> white flags flying hoisted by her own people, a heavy fire was opened upon them from the shore and from the <rs>Congress</rs>, killing some valuable officers and men. Under this fire the steamer left the <rs>Congress</rs>, but as I was not informed that any injury had been sustained by those vessels at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/><persName n="Parker,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0270.0007.00098.00939" reg="nearbymention:Parker,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> having failed to report to me, I took it for granted that my order to him to burn her had been executed, and waited some minutes to see the smoke ascending from her hatches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>During this delay we were still subjected to the heavy fire from the batteries, which was always promptly returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>The steam frigates <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName> and <placeName reg="Roanoke, Roanoke, Virginia" key="tgn,7014343">Roanoke</placeName>, and the sailing <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Saint Lawrence</rs>, had previously been reported as coming from <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>; but as I was determined that the <rs>Congress</rs> should not again fall into the hands of the enemy, I remarked to that gallant young officer, <persName n="Minor,Flag-Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0007.00098.00940" reg="mostcommon:Minor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Flag-Lieutenant">Flag-Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Minor</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">that ship must be burned.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>He promptly volunteered to take a boat and burn her, and <rs type="ship">the Teaser</rs>, <persName n="Webb,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0270.0007.00098.00941" reg="nearbymention:Webb,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Webb</surname></persName>, was ordered to cover the boat.

On witnessing this vile treachery, I instantly recalled the boat and ordered the <rs>Congress</rs> destroyed by hot shot and incendiary shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>About this period I was disabled, and transferred the command of the ship to that gallant, intelligent officer, <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,Catesby,,," id="n0270.0007.00098.00943" reg="default:Jones,Catesby,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Catesby</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, with orders to fight her as long as the men could stand to their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>The ships from <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> opened their fire upon us. The <rs>Minnesota</rs> grounded in the north channel where, unfortunately, the snoalness of the channel prevented our near approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>We continued, however, to fire upon her until the pilots declared that it was no longer safe to remain in that position, and we accordingly returned by the south channel (the middle ground being necessarily between the <rs>Virginia</rs> and <rs>Minnesota</rs> and <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Saint Lawrence</placeName>, the <rs>Roanoke</rs> having retreated under the guns of <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>.) We again had the opportunity of opening upon the <rs>Minnesota</rs>, receiving her heavy fire in return, and, shortly afterwards, upon the <rs>Saint Lawrence</rs>, from which vessel we also received several broadsides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>It had, by this time, become dark, and we soon after anchored off <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>The rest of the squadron followed our movements, with the exception of <rs type="ship">the Beaufort</rs>, <persName n="Parker,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0270.0007.00098.00944" reg="nearbymention:Parker,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>, who proceeded to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> with the wounded and prisoners as soon as he had left the <rs>Congress</rs> without reporting to me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>The Congress, having been set on fire by our hot shot and incendiary shell, continued to burn, her loaded guns being successively discharged as the flames reached them, until a few minutes past midnight, when her magazine exploded with a terrible report.

<p>The facts above stated as having occurred after I had placed the ship in charge of <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0007.00099.00945" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Catesby,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, were reported to me by that officer.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>I, therefore, consented to our being landed on <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName>, thinking that the room on board, vacated by us, could be used for those who might be wounded in the renewal of the action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/><q direct="unspecified">At daylight on the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> we saw that the <rs>Minnesota</rs> was still ashore, and that there was an <orgName n="Iron Battery" type="battery">iron battery</orgName> near her. At <num value="8">eight</num> we ran down to engage them (having previously sent the killed and wounded out of the ship), firing at the <rs>Minnesota</rs>, and occasionally at the <orgName n="Iron Battery" type="battery">iron battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>The pilots did not place us as near as they expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>The great length and draft of the ship rendered it exceedingly difficult to work her; we ran ashore about a mile from the frigate, and were backing <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> before we got off. We continued to fire at the <rs>Minnesota</rs>, and blew up a steamer alongside of her; we also engaged the <rs>Monitor</rs>, sometimes at very close quarters; we once succeeded in running into her, and twice silenced her fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>The pilots declaring that we could get no nearer the <rs>Minnesota</rs>, and believing her to be entirely disabled, and the <rs>Monitor</rs> having run into shoal water, which prevented our doing her any further injury, we ceased firing at <num value="12">twelve</num>, and proceeded to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>Our loss is <measure n="2" type="killed">two killed</measure> and <measure n="19" type="wounded">nineteen wounded</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>It was not easy to keep a flag flying; the flag-staffs were repeatedly shot away; the colors were hoisted to the smoke-stack and several times cut down from it.</q></p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>The remarkable battle between the <rs>Monitor</rs> and the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, and the important service rendered by the <rs>Monitor</rs> on that occasion, are so well known that a recital of the circumstances attending that engagement and its results is not deemed necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>The <rs>Merrimac</rs> was not destroyed or captured by the <rs>Monitor</rs>; but it is fair to presume that the injuries she received in the action prevented her from again encountering the <rs>Monitor</rs>, which vessel remained ready to confront her had she resumed the attack upon the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>These circumstances, together with the fact that other vessels of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> were there, prepared to assist in opposing the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, led, no doubt, to the final destruction of that vessel.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/><persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0270.0008.00121.01094" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> quietly said, <q direct="unspecified">Move your regiment across <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> the abattis and take position on that crest beyond,</q> pointing towards it, and added, <q direct="unspecified">unless you jump the game on the way.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>Feeling sure that it would be jumped on the other edge of the slashings, I asked, <q direct="unspecified">What then?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>He answered, <q direct="unspecified">Press them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>I told him that embarrassment as to my flank and rear had prevented me from crossing the abattis pretty much with them, at least in close pursuit, and asked if I should succeed again, will you look to flanks and rear?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>His answer was, <q direct="unspecified">press them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>We at once entered the abattis, the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 5">Fifth regiment</orgName>, <persName n="Giles,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0008.00122.01095" reg="mostcommon:Giles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Giles</surname></persName>, moving with us on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>I did not see where the sharpshooters went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>When about half way across a grand volley was poured upon us from the thicket beyond, and although nobody cried <q direct="unspecified">Lie down,</q> the entire regiment squatted involuntarily in the brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>As the crash of the volley died away I shouted <q direct="unspecified">Forward,</q> but none seemed to hear it save our color-bearer, and before it could be repeated the roar and rattle of the regular battle-fire opened upon us and drowned human utterances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>He advanced on and over the obstructions, as he could not move under even the highest without lowering his colors, alone, with a stride unnaturally steady, considering the character of his footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>None who saw it can ever forget the splendid picture presented by our glorious and handsome boy, <persName n="Rabb,,John,,," id="n0270.0008.00122.01096" reg="default:Rabb,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Rabb</surname></persName>, on this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>Never were colors borne with a loftier devotion to duty or a quieter disdain of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>He advanced thus alone, nearly halfway to the enemy, and it looked as though our colors would be handed over to them, when our entire regiment seemed simultaneously to take in the situation and made a desperate rush to overtake them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>Our line poured like a wave over and under and through the obstructions, and coming up with the colors, continued the impetuous advance until we swept over theirs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>They retired hastily beyond the crest not far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>We consequently did not kill many of them here, but captured a few prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>Emerging from the thicket from which they were driven, and hastily readjusting our ranks, we pushed on towards the crest, and soon encountered the most formidable line, and became engaged in the fiercest fight of the day. The ground over which we passed was thinly studded with sapling pine growth, affording no obstruction to speak of either to the bullets or to the view of either side, and it was the same, though apparently more broken, for a long distance to our right; to our left, woods of thick growth seemed not more than a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> or so distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>As we approached the crest, their line could be seen extending from the woods on our left across our <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> front and to the right for several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, as far as I could see on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>They opened upon us a terrific fire, direct from the front and oblique from both sides, but we continued steadily to advance until within <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> of them, when our line was staggered, checked, and finally borne down by the weight of this converging fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>The men, checked though they were, and borne down by force when they wished to proceed, were nevertheless unhacked, and opened a fierce and rapid fire on the enemy in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>Not knowing at the time why the <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num> had not come out of the abattis with us (their gallant <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> was killed by the volley we met there, and they were embarrassed and delayed by his fall), I looked anxiously for them to come up and relieve us from a portion of the fire, but neither they nor any other help were in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>I was unwilling to undertake a retreat over such ground as was in our rear, and determined to make another effort to break through the enemy's line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>Amid the roar of that fierce storm no human voice could have been heard by even a company, and to secure that unity of action which the emergency demanded, it was necessary to convey to the commanders of companies instructions to notify their men and have them prepared to rise up at a concerted signal, and push through the line in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>This consumed time, and held our men under this destructive fire longer than was desirable, but it could not be helped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>As soon as possible the signal was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>All, except the dead and dying (who, unhappily for us, were numerous enough to mark our line from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other, after we left it), rose and moved, though crouching as they breasted the pelting storm, steadily and unfalteringly forward without firing a gun, until the enemy gave way, when we poured in our volley of buck and ball at close range and with telling effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>Although their lines were broken and shattered, they yielded the ground with great reluctance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>They for some time made strenuous efforts to reform close in our front, and repeatedly gathered in groups about their colors and around their officers, who made heroic efforts to rally them, only to be piled in heaps by the shot and ball belched from our old smooth bores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>These efforts they stubbornly continued until there seemed not a standard left, not an officer to rally them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>While we were pressing this, the most valiant foe that we had yet met, being apprehensive of attack from the enemy on either the right or left of the point of their line penetrated by us, or on both, which, promptly made, would certainly and easily have crushed us before our supports could come up, I was anxiously looking to both, and <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> it was with much satisfaction that I saw on our right <num value="5">five</num> columns with <num value="5">five</num> stands of colors double-quicking to the rear in beautiful order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>They disappeared across the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road in the direction of <placeName reg="White Oak Swamp, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2766789">White Oak Swamp</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>I could not see for the woods what those on the left were doing, but the regiments on the right, acting evidently under the impression that the <rs>Confederates</rs> were in force on their right flank, suggested the idea that those on the left were under a similar impression as to their left flank.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>It was with a great sense of relief that I again gave my entire attention to the brief but explicit and satisfactory order of our General, <q direct="unspecified">Press them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>When, however, the gallant foemen in our front gave up all hope, ceased their stubborn futile efforts at resistance, and incontinently fled, the regiment for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that day lost its order, and the men broke away in a wild chase after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>Unable to stop the foremost, the only way to keep them at all together was by urging the hindmost forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>We struck the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road obliquely, our right touching it near <placeName reg="Seven Pines House">Seven Pines House</placeName>, when a regiment posted in the edge of a pine thicket on the other side of the road, their line being parallel to the road, opened fire on our right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>About <num value="2">two</num> companies on our right were stopped by it, and forming in the road engaged this new enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>The balance of the regiment rushed on in pursuit into the woods, down the road, making a wide interval between them and the companies on their right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>I sent <persName n="Means,Sergeant-Major,Beverly,,," id="n0270.0008.00124.01097" reg="default:Means,Beverly,,,"><roleName n="Sergeant-Major">Sergeant-Major</roleName> <foreName>Beverly</foreName> <surname>Means</surname></persName>, who was at hand, to catch our wild boys on the left, and order them to form on the <num value="2">two</num> companies in the road, and urged dispatch, as I feared that the enemy might charge us in that condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>To prevent this, our men who stopped near the house were formed in the road and ordered to keep up as brisk a fire as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>My brave men, individually, as they got the orders, ran promptly back up the road, into and under fire at less than <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>, formed as it were by file on our men fighting there, and thus by their individual pluck and devotion to duty enabled us to meet the emergency and avert the danger in the shortest and of course the best way. If we had taken the usual course under such circumstances, and fallen back to reform, we would have lost ground, lost time, and have effected less at a perhaps greater cost of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>While this formation in the very front of the battle and in the teeth of the enemy was going on, I was looking with anxiety for the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 5">Fifth regiment</orgName> to come up, still not knowing the cause of its delay&mdash; the fall of its heroic <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>&mdash;when I saw a regiment moving up from <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> the rear and directly towards the gap in my line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>I sent an urgent request that it move up promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>It proved to be the <orgName n="Palmetto Sharpshooters" type="regiment">Palmetto Sharpshooters</orgName>, and <persName n="Jenkins,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0008.00125.01098" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName> replied that he would be with me in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>When in about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> of the road, however, he changed front forward on the <orgName type="regiment" key="12Company">twelfth company</orgName>, and although the balls fired at us, forming and fighting on the road, dipped into them with destructive effect, it was done in a style rarely equalled on the drill field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>This was followed by a change of front on the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">first company</orgName>, executed in the same admirable manner in view and under fire of the enemy, which brought them in position to form on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>Before these <num value="2">two</num> evolutions were completed, our <rs type="role" reg="Sergeant-Major">Sergeant-Major</rs> reported that all of our men were in line on the road, but some of them were not in their proper places, or even in their companies, and wanted to know if that would do. Glancing along the line I saw every man who was out of place looking back towards me, and answered their question by a motion of my hand, waving them down where they were, saying, although they could not hear me, <q direct="unspecified">We are all right now, lie down where you are.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>Our <rs type="role" reg="Sergeant-Major">Sergeant-Major</rs> exclaimed with suppressed enthusiasm, <q direct="unspecified">Isn't that glorious!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>The old regiment is surely more than filling her measure to-day.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>His countenance was all aglow with that peculiar light often seen in the faces of brave men in battle, and which is so inspiring to the beholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>I ordered him to lie down behind the line, as I wanted everybody as much under shelter as possible, while we were waiting for <persName n="Jenkins,,,,," id="n0270.0008.00125.01099" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><surname>Jenkins</surname></persName> to come up on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>A moment afterwards the fatal bullet pierced his breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>It was thus that Beverly Means, who, in peace, was as gentle and modest as a woman, met death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>It was about this time that I found that the shells and cannon balls that had been whirling over us and plunging amongst us during our disorderly pursuit, and now enfilading our line on the road, were coming from the direction of the battery taken by <persName n="Hill,,D.,H.,," id="n0270.0008.00125.01100" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>I sent a messenger to stop its fire on us, but he probably never reached it, as it continued to fire as long as I remained on the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>As soon as <persName n="Jenkins,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0008.00125.01101" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName> arrived on the line with his regiment he gave me the order, <q direct="unspecified">Advance your regiment and I will support you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>Remembering that I had been notified before we reached the battlefield that he was in command of the brigade I promptly obeyed his order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>Looking along my battered line, now about half its original length, with half of its captains knocked out, I had reason to be anxious lest some irregularity of movement might place the regiment at disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>To prevent this and ensure unity and <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> order in their advance I walked across the road to the front and waving my cap to attract the attention of all, officers and men, ordered the line forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>Rising from the road in which they had been lying they advanced deliberately, steadily and firmly, closing gaps promptly until the enemy broke, when they poured in their volley and rushed on them, sweeping them from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>This was perhaps the fairest fight we had that day; there was no great disparity of numbers between their regiment and ours; they seemed to be about equal; but we had the advantage of the immediate presence of the <name>Sharpshooters</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>Our disadvantages were our battered condition, loss of officers and men in previous fights, our lying so long under their fire, a part of the time not returning it, that they recovered from the excitement of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> onset and directed their fire with a better aim. Most of their balls were on a line with us, fewer of them passed over our heads than in any previous attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>We met this line of fire when we rose up in the road, and it continued without abatement, aided by the shot and shell plunging into and about us from the battery on the right, until we were within <measure n="25yards" type="distance">twenty-five yards</measure> of them, when I was shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>So steady was their fire and unshaken their line that the result even then was doubtful; and those near me, who naturally came to my assistance, were peremptorily ordered to the front where every bayonet was needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>My eyesight failed, a premonition of the fainting that followed, and I could not see you my comrades, but I heard the volley which you delivered as you passed over me, and the <q direct="unspecified">yell,</q> receding from me as you advanced, relieved the anxiety which was intensified by my condition, and gave assurance that you had again swept the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>When my sight returned you were seen in line with the <name>Sharpshooters</name> in the edge of the woods on the left, fronting down the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>When last seen by me the whole line seemed to be moving by the left flank across the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>And here the story of your movements and conduct on this field, as seen and known by me, necessarily ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>I learn from others that the regiment, led by its <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs>, the truly good and brave <persName n="Steadman,,,,," id="n0270.0008.00126.01102" reg="mostcommon:Steadman,nomatch:0"><surname>Steadman</surname></persName>, had still another engagement with the enemy before the battle closed, with the result to which it was now becoming accustomed, and, crippled and torn as it was, added new laurels to those already won that day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>By the movement to the left alluded to a moment ago the field of my last conflict was left uncovered in our front and in the direction taken by the <num value="5">five</num> regiments of the enemy that I had seen retiring rapidly but in good order across the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road, and it was still <pb id="p.127" n="127"/> being probed by the fire of the artillery up the road which, I concluded from its continuance after I had sent to have it stopped, was from a battery of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>(It seems, however, that it was in fact <persName n="Hill,,D.,H.,," id="n0270.0008.00127.01103" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="battery">battery</orgName>.) The wounded left on the field gathered around me, the noble fellows striving to assist me, when they needed assistance themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>Knowing that there was nothing to prevent it, I expected the <num value="5">five</num> regiments alluded to to return and retake the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>To avoid their capture and also danger from the artillery fire, I ordered all who could possibly do so to go to the rear and not wait for litter-bearers or ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>All who could obeyed the order except <persName n="Simonton,,Boyce,,," id="n0270.0008.00127.01104" reg="default:Simonton,Boyce,,,"><foreName>Boyce</foreName> <surname>Simonton</surname></persName>, of <orgName type="company" n="Company G">Company G</orgName>, and <persName n="Gandy,,,,," id="n0270.0008.00127.01105" reg="mostcommon:Gandy,nomatch:0"><surname>Gandy</surname></persName>, of <orgName type="company" n="Company E">Company E</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>They mutinied and refused to leave me, saying that those who had gone to the rear were to send for us all. I made the effort to go at least far enough to the rear to save these brave boys from capture; <persName n="Gandy,,,,," id="n0270.0008.00127.01106" reg="mostcommon:Gandy,nomatch:0"><surname>Gandy</surname></persName> had with him a prisoner, <persName n="McFarland,Captain,John,D.,," id="n0270.0008.00127.01107" reg="default:McFarland,John,D.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>McFarland</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="102PARegiment">One Hundred and Second Pennsylvania Regiment</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>(Finding that we could not spare guards for the prisoners taken, they were sent to the rear sometimes without them, but generally in charge of our wounded who were able to go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>Some of them escaped through the gap between us in our advanced and constantly advancing position, and our supports). The only member of our party capable of helping another was this prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>He rendered every assistance in his power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>Our progress was interrupted and delayed by fainting spells, and from the same cause, perhaps, we were diverted from our course to the right towards the railroad (our left as we went in.) At any rate, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> consciousness after a faint was of some <num value="1">one</num> tugging at me, and the next was hearing the voice of our prisoner captain saying, <q direct="unspecified">Handle him tenderly, boys, he was kind to me, and is badly wounded.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>The boys, <num value="2">two</num> in number, belonged, if my memory is correct, to a <orgName type="mil" key="NHRegiment">New Hampshire regiment</orgName>, and were detailed as a hospital guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>They said that their hospital was not far off, but it was being moved, and they and our <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> captain, although apprehensive of capture themselves, helped and urged us on to reach the hospital before the surgeon left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>But we made slow progress, until they saw their chaplain and called to him for assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>He quickly brought a litter, on which they took me to the hospital, which was presided over by <persName n="Gesner,Doctor,,,," id="n0270.0008.00127.01108" reg="nearbymention:Gesner,B.,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gesner</surname></persName>, of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>I shall never forget the kindness and tender attention of this surgeon and the chaplain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>I here learned how seriously <persName n="Simonton,,,,," id="n0270.0008.00127.01109" reg="nearbymention:Simonton,Boyce,,,"><surname>Simonton</surname></persName> was wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>After making us as comfortable as the state of the case would admit <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> of, <persName n="Gesner,Doctor,,,," id="n0270.0008.00128.01110" reg="nearbymention:Gesner,B.,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gesner</surname></persName> left, informing me that I was behind our own lines, and that he had to go before the gap through which he had moved his hospital was closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>Late in the night, I think after <time value="12am">midnight</time>, <persName n="Birney,General,,,," id="n0270.0008.00128.01111" reg="mostcommon:Birney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Birney</surname></persName> came in, and I learned from him that they had been heavily reinforced from the other side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and were reoccupying the positions from which they had been driven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>This excited my alarm for you, for without knowing exactly where I was, there could be no doubt in my mind that you were some distance in advance of where these reinforcements were being posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Nor was I relieved until sent to the rear, where I had access to their newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>In these I saw nothing in relation to you, but glowing accounts of the resistless advance of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 6">Sixth Regiment</orgName> and <orgName n="Palmetto Sharpshooters" type="regiment">Palmetto Sharpshooters</orgName> giving their specific names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>Your prowess on this field won for your colonel, a prisoner in their hands, the consideration of those who encountered you here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>To say nothing of innumerable attentions paid by officers and men of a large camp near which I was lying the next day, and among them were some who had been captured by us, and escaped while going to the rear, I was the recipient of the most generous and courteous consideration from the knightly <persName n="Kearney,General,Philip,,," id="n0270.0008.00128.01114" reg="default:Kearney,Philip,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName n="Philip">Phil.</foreName> <surname>Kearney</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>On learning that my wound was not fatal, as at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reported to him, he took the trouble to send a special messenger to the rear to see that I was properly cared for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>They did not even know my name.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>When in the midst of raging battle trophies were brought to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/></p> 
<p>But these attentions to a wounded, helpless prisoner, who was only known by the prowess of his regiment in the fight, were the knightly courtesies of a gallant enemy, and were accepted as such with feelings of profoundest gratification and pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>They are, indeed, the noblest trophies of war, as they can be won only from a brave and worthy foe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>My old comrades, in the performance of this duty, which has been <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> so long deferred, I have confined myself to a plain, simple statement of what you did under my own eye. So far from attempting, I have avoided highly drawn pictures of gallantry displayed in this action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>If I have succeeded in making that statement intelligible, your deeds, more than any expression of admiration on my part of your conduct, are relied on for that justice which has so long been your due. To sum them up in brief, you advanced over <num value="3">three</num> lines of the enemy, <num value="2">two</num> of them in position behind obstructions of felled timber or slashings, and all of them in superior numbers to you. Although checked and borne down by the weight of fire of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, without falling back, you rose and continued the advance to a successful result, the only instance of the kind that I know of. When after the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> conflict your line was broken, it was done by your own eager and wild pursuit of the enemy, after a terrific contest, and after the loss of <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of your captains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>While in the condition of an advancing, wild, yelling mob, an unexpected volley was poured into your right flank, which had only the happy effect of recalling those on that flank to their senses, for they at once became heedful of orders, and with wonderful promptness, presented a solid front to this fresh foe, and held them at bay until the balance formed on them, and in a short time charged and swept him from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>All this without once falling back to reform your lines, or yielding at any time an inch of the ground gained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>This advance of more than a mile from where you met their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volley, over <num value="4">four</num> lines of the enemy was effected in less than <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>We have often read of a warrior's eyes figuratively flashing fire, but it is literally true that on this occasion <hi rend="italics">his</hi> eyes emitted sparks of light and his grand <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> claimed the devotion instinctively rendered to the born <hi rend="italics">leader of men</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>The Federals were armed with breech loading carbines, which they fired, but without effect, except for mortally wounding <num value="1">one</num> horse whose indomitable pluck nerved him nevertheless to carry his rider gallantly to the end of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>By the time their carbines had been discharged once, their assailants were nearly upon them, and they were bashful about making a nearer acquaintance with strangers; without attempting to reload carbines, or to draw pistols or sabres the company broke in wild terror and all fled for their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>They became jammed frantically together, their <num value="1">one</num> idea <q direct="unspecified">Devil take the hindmost</q> (which <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was very busy trying to do).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>Those of them who succeeded in getting away, continued furiously down the road, and never thought themselves safe until they reached their friends, who, it seems, were in force less than a mile distant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>This detachment had probably been thrown forward to ascertain the position of our troops and had blundered into the town somehow through our pickets, where, more bent upon <q direct="unspecified">spoils</q> than <q direct="unspecified">strategems,</q> <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> they had commenced, after their manner, robbing the women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>Their captain, instead of attending properly to his military duties, was not at the head of his company when it was charged, but was busy plundering and was gathered in after his men were routed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>A life, too, was saved that morning by <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0270.0010.00147.01321" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>It is true it was a very unimportant life, of no value whatever at that time to any <num value="1">one</num> but the possessor, and not of much to him, but still it was a human life, and, being such, the deed has no doubt been duly entered by the recording angel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>It happened in this way: A soldier was returning alone from the pursuit of the fugitives when he encountered a Federal straggler coming from the town, not far from the corner above alluded to. He charged the fellow with his sabre, all the chambers of his revolver being empty, when the man in order to escape left his horse and sprang over a fence into an adjoining field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>The Confederate got his horse across the fence, cut the <rs>Federal</rs> down, and then ordered him to march in front of him as a prisoner, which, in broken <persName n="English,,German,,," id="n0270.0010.00147.01322" reg="default:English,German,,,"><foreName>German</foreName> <surname>English</surname></persName>, he readily promised to do. As they neared the fence again, however, going back to the road, he turned upon and was about to kill his captor with a small revolver, which had been secreted on his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>Just then, <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0270.0010.00147.01323" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> who had come up, and was watching from the road what was going on, covered the enterprising prisoner with his revolver (which was <hi rend="italics">unloaded</hi>), and, like the historic coon, he did not wait to be shot, but handed over his pistol to his intended victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>But, like many a better man, this Hessian was too <q direct="unspecified">smart</q> for his own good, for hardly had he surrendered to the cavalryman his revolver when he sprang nimbly to regain his carbine, which was lying on the ground near where he had been cut down, but before he could reach it <num value="2">two</num> bullets from his own pistol went through his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>Another soldier, who searched the unsavory corpse a few minutes afterwards, found on it, among other stolen things, several watches (his especial weakness apparently); thus he was identified as <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0270.0010.00147.01324" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:3"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s men. <pb id="p.148" n="148"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>All of our troops and wagon trains were brought safely across the river without any loss and without material annoyance from the enemy; though, before the bridge was burned, some of his skirmishers came up along the river bank and made it a trifle too hot for comfort to those crossing last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>Thus the <rs>Federal</rs> reconnoisance proved a fiasco, but if the detachment had fought properly, and had been ably seconded by supports, the affair might have had a very different result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>After crossing the fence I received an order from Brigadier-General Law to left wheel my regiment and move in the direction of the heights upon my left, which order I failed to obey for the reason that when I received it I was rapidly advancing up the mountain, and in my front I discovered a heavy force of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>Besides this there was great difficulty in accomplishing the manoeuvre at that moment, as the regiment on my left (<orgName type="regiment" key="AL47">Forty-seventh Alabama</orgName>) was crowding me on the left and running into my regiment, which had already created considerable confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>In the event that I had obeyed the order, I should have come in contact with the regiment on my left, and also have exposed my right flank to an enfilading fire from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>I, therefore, continued to press forward my right, passing over the top of the mountain on the right of the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>On reaching the foot of the mountain below I found the enemy in heavy force posted in rear of large rocks upon a slight elevation beyond a depression of some <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> in width between the base of the mountain and the open plain beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>I engaged them, my right meeting the left of their line exactly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>Here I lost several gallant officers and men. After firing <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> rounds I discovered that the enemy were giving way in my front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>I ordered a charge, and the enemy in my front fled, but that portion of his line confronting the <num value="2">two</num> companies on my left <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> held their ground, and continued a most galling fire upon my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>Just at this moment I discovered the regiment on my left (<orgName type="regiment" key="AL47">Forty-seventh Alabama</orgName>) retiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>I halted my regiment as its left reached a very large rock, and ordered a left wheel of the regiment, which was executed in good order under fire, thus taking advantage of a ledge of rocks running off in a line perpendicularly to the <num value="1">one</num> I had just abandoned, and affording very good protection to my men. This position enabled me to keep up a constant flank and cross fire upon the enemy, which, in less than <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>, caused him to change front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>Receiving reinforcements, he charged me <num value="5">five</num> times, and was as often repulsed with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>Finally I discovered that the enemy had flanked me on the right, and <num value="2">two</num> regiments were moving rapidly upon my rear and not <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure>, when, to save my regiment from capture or destruction, I ordered a retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>On reaching the enemy's lines where they were well and strongly situated, I ordered my regiment to forward, which was gallantly obeyed until within about <num value="20">twenty</num> paces of their line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>Here the fire of the enemy was severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>Here the men opened fire on the enemy, and for some time continued, until the left, from the loss of men and their exposed position to a fire from the front and from the mountain on the right, were forced to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>The right steadily maintained its position for some time, forcing the enemy to withdraw from their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line and establish their line a short distance to their rear, where they continued their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>After the contest had continued for an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, and my whole regiment had been brought to the front the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time only to be driven back, I ordered them to reform in the rear of their advanced position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/>While doing this I was ordered to take command of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2596"/>After this the regiment was commanded by <persName n="Eubanks,Captain,T.,J.,," id="n0270.0014.00184.01651" reg="default:Eubanks,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Eubanks</surname></persName>, who reformed and carried it to the front, where the battle-ground was held during the night, bringing off our wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2597"/>In this battle the regiment had <num value="275">two hundred and seventy-five</num> men engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>There were <measure n="102" type="killed, wounded and missing">one hundred and two killed, wounded and missing</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>It occupied the place of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Battalion">second battalion</orgName> in the line formed by the brigade on the heights which ran parallel with and fronting the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>Having advanced with the brigade down the long slope and through the intervening meadow it was detached from its place in the line by order of General Law and by a flank movement was brought to the extreme left of the brigade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>When at a short distance from the stone fence near the base of the mountain, General Law informed me that he expected my regiment to take a battery which had been playing on our line from the moment the advance begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>This battery was situated, not on the mountain itself, but on a rugged cliff, which formed the abrupt termination of a ridge that proceeded from the mountain and ran in a direction somewhat parallel with it, leaving a valley destitute of trees and filled with immense boulders between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>This valley&mdash;not more than <num value="300">three hundred</num> paces in breadth&mdash;and the cliff on which their artillery was stationed was occupied by <num value="2">two</num> regiments of the enemy's infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>The direction of the regiment after crossing the stone fence was such that a march to the front would have carried it to the right of the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>It was therefore wheeled to the left so as to confront that position, its left opposite the battery and its right extending toward the base of the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>This movement was executed under fire and within <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>The forward movement was immediately ordered and was responded to with an alacrity and courage seldom, if ever, excelled on the battlefield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>As the men emerged from the forest into the valley before mentioned they received a deadly volley at short range which, in a few seconds, killed or disabled <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> their number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>Halting without an order from me and availing themselves of the shelter which the rocks afforded they returned the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>Such was their extreme exhaustion-having marched without interruption <num value="24">twenty-four</num> <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> miles to reach the battlefield and advanced at a double-quick step fully a mile to engage the enemy&mdash;that I hesitated for an instant to order them immediately forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>Perceiving very soon, however, that the enemy were giving way, I rushed forward shouting to them to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>It was with the greatest difficulty that I could make myself heard or understood above the din of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>The order was, however, extended along the line and was promptly obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>The men sprang forward over the rocks, swept the position, and took possession of the heights, capturing <num value="40">forty</num> or <measure n="50" type="prisoners">fifty prisoners</measure> around the battery and among the cliffs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>Meanwhile, the enemy had put a battery in position on a terrace of the mountain to our right, which opened upon us an enfilading fire of grape and spherical case shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>A sharp fire of small arms was also opened from the same direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/>This was not destructive, however, owing to the protection afforded by the rocks.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>At the word forward the regiment moved forward in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>The enemy had a line of sharpshooters at the foot of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> height behind a stone fence about <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile from our starting point, which distance was passed over by our line at a double-quick and a run. At our approach the enemy retired to the top of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> height protected by a ledge of rocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>A short halt was made at the stone fence to enable those who had fallen behind to regain their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>When the command forward again fell from the lips of our gallant <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, every man leaped the fence and advanced rapidly up the hillside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>The enemy again fled at our approach, sheltering himself behind his fortified position on the top of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> height, about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure> from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>From this position we failed to drive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>Our failure was owing to the rocky nature of the ground over which we had to pass, the huge rocks forming defiles through which not more than <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> men abreast could pass, thus breaking up our alignment and rendering its reformation impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>Notwithstanding the difficulties to overcome, the men pressed on to the pass of the precipitous strong hold, forming and <hi rend="italics">securing</hi> the enemy's <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> position (many of our officers and men falling in passing the open space between the heights.) Here we halted, there being small clusters of rocks far below the elevated position of the enemy, which gave us partial protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>From this position we were enabled to deliver our fire for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time with accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>Seeing that the <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> men were in the best obtainable position, and deeming a further advance without reinforcements impracticable, a great many of the regiment having been already disabled, I looked for <persName n="Powell,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0014.00193.01708" reg="nearbymention:Powell,R.,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Powell</surname></persName> to know his next order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>Failing to see him, I concluded at once that he, like many of his gallant officers and men, had fallen a victim to the deadly missiles of the enemy, which were being showered like hail upon us. I moved towards the centre, passing many officers and men who had fallen, having discharged their whole duty like true soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>I had not proceeded far when I discovered the prostrate form of our noble <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, who had fallen at his post his face to the foe. I hastened towards him, when I received a wound in my left arm. On reaching the <rs>Colonel</rs> I found that he was not dead, but seeing the rent in his coat where the ball had passed out, my fears were excited that his wound would prove mortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>The hemorrhage from my own wound forced me from the field, leaving the command upon <persName n="Rogers,Major,,,," id="n0270.0014.00193.01709" reg="nearbymention:Rogers,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>The officers and men of my wing of the regiment continued to discharge their duties in a manner worthy of our cause so long as I remained upon the field, and from their conduct heretofore, I would not hesitate to vouch for them during the remainder of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>I, therefore, gave the order for the regiment to about face and retire to the rear, which they did in good order, until they reached the position mentioned in <persName n="Bryan,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0014.00194.01718" reg="nearbymention:Bryan,K.,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bryan</surname></persName>'s reports as the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> position of the enemy, and here were halted and reformed in connection with the other regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>From the exhausted condition of the men, it was deemed necessary to remain here for a few moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>The regiments were again ordered forward, which they did in the most gallant manner, and regained their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> position, which they held as long as it was tenable, and a further advance being impracticable, owing to the nature of the ground, as expressed in <persName n="Bryan,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0014.00194.01719" reg="nearbymention:Bryan,K.,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bryan</surname></persName>'s report, they again retired in good order to an open space about <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> in rear, when here it was discovered for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that nearly <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of our officers and men had been killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>Only a few moments were here consumed to allow the men to recover their breath, when <hi rend="italics">in obedience to orders</hi>, I again moved the regiment forward to attack the enemy in their impregnable position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>The coolness and determination of the men and officers was equal to the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>They advanced boldly over the ground strewn with the bodies of their dead and dying comrades to the base of what <hi rend="italics">they knew to be an impregnable fortification</hi>. We held this position until it was discovered that we had no supports either on the right or left, and were about to be flanked, and, therefore, were again compelled to retire, which the regiment did in good order to the point mentioned in <persName n="Bryan,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0014.00194.01720" reg="nearbymention:Bryan,K.,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bryan</surname></persName>'s report as the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> position of the enemy, which place we were ordered to hold at all hazards, which we did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>The order was obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>During the day constant skirmishing was kept up with the enemy, which resulted in the loss to us of many of our best scouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>Late in the evening, in obedience to orders, I about faced my regiment and marched <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile to the crest of the ridge from which the charge of the day previous commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>Upon reaching this road, I discovered, from the direction the directing regiment was taking, that I could not, with the length of my line, carry out the latter order, hence I decided to keep my command on a prolongation of the line formed by the troops on my right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>After marching in line of battle at a brisk gait, part of the way at a double-quick, for about <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">one thousand yards</measure>, all the time exposed to a destructive fire from artillery, we engaged the enemy at short range, strongly posted behind a rock fence at the edge of woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>We drove him back with but little loss for a distance of <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure>, when I ascertained that I was suffering from a fire to my left and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>Thereupon I ordered a change of front to the rear on <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">first company</orgName>, but the noise (consequent upon the heavy firing then going on) swallowed up my command, and I contented myself with the irregular drawing back of the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, giving it an excellent fire, which pressed the enemy back in a very short while, whereupon the whole line advanced&mdash;the enemy fighting stubbornly, <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> but retiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>Soon I was again admonished that my left was seriously threatened, when I ordered the command back <num value="50">fifty</num> or <measure n="75yards" type="distance">seventy-five yards</measure> to meet this contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>He was again driven back, and I stretched out my front twice its legitimate length, guarding well my left and advanced to the ledge of rocks from which we had previously been dislodged by the enemy's movement upon my flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>I experienced some annoyance from the exposure of this flank up to this moment, when <persName n="Little,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0014.00196.01730" reg="nearbymention:Little,F.,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Little</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="11GARegiment">Eleventh Georgia regiment</orgName>, joined to my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="59GARegiment">Fifty-ninth Georgia regiment</orgName> coming also at this time, occupied the line with my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>Some little time after this I was disabled by concussion and wound on my nose and forehead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>After a most tiresome march through the mountains, this regiment, belonging to <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Benning,,,,," id="n0270.0014.00197.01742" reg="mostcommon:Benning,Henry,L.,,:1"><surname>Benning</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, arrived at <num value="2">2</num>, night, in the neighborhood of the scene of an engagement which took place on the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">1st inst.</day></dateStruct>, where it was permitted to bivouac for a few hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>At <time value="3am">3 A. M.</time> it resumed the march, and again halted after proceeding some <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>. At I P. M. it again took up the line of march, moving by a circuitous route to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>Notwithstanding the extreme heat, and the fatiguing march, the officers and men of this regiment moved <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> forward with great cheerfulness, seeming anxious to meet the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>Just before reaching its position in line, the regiment advanced by the right flank through an open field under a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery, which was posted on a commanding position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>It gives me great pleasure to state that the officers and men of this command acted very coolly and moved forward in good order; here <persName n="Sapp,Lieutenant,J.,C.,," id="n0270.0014.00198.01743" reg="default:Sapp,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Sapp</surname></persName> was slightly wounded, but continued with his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>Before advancing in line of battle the command was permitted to rest a few moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="GA2">Second Georgia</orgName> composed the right, and with the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA17">Seventeenth Georgia</orgName>, the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Benning,,,,," id="n0270.0014.00198.01744" reg="mostcommon:Benning,Henry,L.,,:1"><surname>Benning</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>Soon the order to advance was given, when the entire regiment moved forward in splendid order until it came to a deep gorge where the nature of the ground was such that it was impossible to preserve any alignment; but, notwithstanding the rocks, undergrowth and the deadly fire of the enemy, the officers and men of this regiment moved forward with dauntless courage, driving the enemy before them, and did not halt until they saw they were some distance in advance of their line, and beyond a rocky eminence on the left, which had been previously held by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>Here the regiment made a stand, and fought as gallantly as men could fight, and did not yield an inch of ground, but repulsed several charges made by the enemy who were protected by a battery, and a hill lined with sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>It was shortly after the regiment halted that <persName n="Harris,Lieutenant-Colonel,William,T.,," id="n0270.0014.00198.01745" reg="default:Harris,William,T.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName> fell, pierced through the heart by a minie-ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>He behaved gallantly and coolly while advancing and was in the act of cheering on his command when he received the fatal shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>The command then devolved upon the undersigned, who was <rs type="role" reg="Major">Major</rs> of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>We held our position until night closed the bloody drama.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>We have to deplore the loss of many gallant officers and men, a list of whom has been previously forwarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>I take great pleasure in testifying to the gallantry displayed both by officers and men, and, in my humble judgment, men never fought with more determination and bravery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>We captured quite a number of prisoners, of whom previous mention has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>It is impossible to individualize where all acted so nobly and courageously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>In the brigade formation the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 20">Twentieth regiment</orgName> occupied the left centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>Before reaching the point wherefrom to make the attack, it was necessary to move by the right flank a distance of nearly <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>. The enemy's guns commanded a considerable portion of this distance, and opened a heavy fire of shell upon us for more than a mile of the way. About <time value="5pm">five o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>We had not advanced far before it was ascertained that there was a considerable space intervening between <persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0270.0014.00199.01754" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Robertson,,,,," id="n0270.0014.00199.01755" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,A.,A.,G.,"><surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s brigades</orgName> unoccupied by any Confederate troops, save very few belonging to the <orgName type="regiment" key="1TXRegiment">First Texas regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>Near to the centre of this comparatively unoccupied ground, upon a steep, rocky, rugged hill, the enemy had posted a battery of <num value="6">six</num> guns, from which a destructive and vigorous fire was poured into our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>To cover this ground, and to support <persName n="Robertson,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0270.0014.00199.01756" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,A.,A.,G.,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, who was pressed severely at the time, a left oblique movement was made and continued until the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 20">Twentieth regiment</orgName> fronted this battery, when the brigade was ordered to <pb id="p.200" n="200"/> advance forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>The order was obeyed by the regiment with promptness and alacrity, and the charge upon the hill and battery executed courageously and successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>In the space of <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> the hill was carried, and <num value="3">three</num> <num value="10">10</num>-pound <name type="weapon">Parrott guns</name> captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>They were brought off that night, and the next day turned against the enemy in that terrible artillery fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>Some <measure n="25" type="prisoners">twenty-five prisoners</measure> were captured and sent to the rear, some of whom aided our wounded in getting to the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/><num value="3">Three</num> regiments, viz.: the <orgName type="regiment" key="PA99">Ninety-ninth Pennsylvania</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="NY126">One Hundred and Twenty-sixth New York</orgName>, and <orgName type="regiment" key="ME4">Fourth Maine</orgName>, were represented in the person of the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>After the enemy was driven from the hill, they poured upon us a terrific and incessant fire from the steep mountain side directly to our front, their advance line of infantry being distant about <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure>, and pretty well protected by large rocks and stones heaped together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>About <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> a regiment was moved to get to our left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>A shot from <persName n="Jordan,Private,John,F.,," id="n0270.0014.00200.01757" reg="default:Jordan,John,F.,,"><roleName n="Private">Private</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Jordan</surname></persName>, of Company <q direct="unspecified">G,</q> unhorsed the officer leading it, when their ranks were broken, and they retreated in wild disorder and confusion, my regiment adding no little to their panic by opening a telling volley into their scattered ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>No other advance was attempted by them upon the hill we occupied while we held it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>Our loss in the charge was very heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>He was an excellent officer and devoted patriot, and a braver spirit never fought beneath a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>His loss will long be felt in this command.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>Shortly after nightfall the firing ceased&mdash;the enemy employing himself in building breastworks on the mountain side in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>By the dawn of the following day he had constructed in plain view <num value="3">three</num> lines of breastworks, which could not have been mounted without the use of scaling ladders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>A <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> line, not so distinctly visible, did not appear to be so high or strong.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>The <num value="20" type="ordinal">Twentieth</num> held the hill until near <time value="7pm">seven o'clock P. M.</time> on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> under a dangerous but desultory fire of the enemy, mainly infantry, <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> when we were ordered to fall back to a more tenable position, about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> to our left rear&mdash;the withdrawal of troops on our left making such order necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>Indeed, the enemy had well-nigh gained our left flank before it was known that we were without supports there to meet him. Owing to a misunderstanding of orders as to the point aimed at and as to the manner in which the retreat should be conducted, considerable disorder attended its inception; but the regiment was formed again upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> favorable ground, and good order soon restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>The loss on this retreat was <num value="17">seventeen</num> men, some of whom are known to have been killed and others wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>I have had no means of ascertaining whether any unwounded men fell into the enemy's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>The men generally were almost worn down by hard marching, harder fighting, constant watching, loss of sleep, hunger and almost intolerable heat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>Nevertheless, buoyed up by the unconquerable spirit of men who deserve to be free, they bore it all with the fortitude, constancy, uncomplaining devotion and patriotism which have distinguished them in so many campaigns and avouched their soldierly character and merit upon so many fields of triumph and glory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>Upon reaching the hill designated, hasty breastworks were constructed, and the command kept under arms, but the enemy did not choose to attack us, and the struggle terminated here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>Instances of individual valor and gallantry were many and splendid; the coolness and courage of every man seemed equal to his opportunity, and where all, so far as I could observe, performed their full duty manfully and well, I should do injustice to many by specially commending a few whose conduct and bearing happened to fall within the scope of my own observation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>By reference to the accompanying list of casualties it will be seen that our losses in the battle of <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> were, in killed, <num value="2">two</num> officers and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> men; wounded, officers, <num value="4">four</num>; men, <num value="73">seventy-three</num>; missing, <num value="4">four</num>, and on Friday the total missing is <num value="17">seventeen</num>, making an aggregate loss of <num value="121">one hundred and twenty-one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>It may be proper to add that our battle-flag is marked with <num value="87">eighty-seven</num> holes, <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> of which seem to have been made by minie-balls, the remainder, from the character of the rents, by fragments of shell.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>The scene of action was reached by a march of several miles under a burning sun, and for the distance of <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> under a terrific fire of the enemy's batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>Advancing to the crest of the hill, where the <rs type="place">Emmettsburg pike</rs> enters the woods in front of the enemy's position along a ravine near the base of the mountain, the regiment bore unflinchingly with the remainder of the brigade the severe enfilading fire of the enemy's batteries upon <placeName key="tgn,2230256" n="1.000 81" reg="cemetery hill, adams, pennsylvania">Cemetery Hill</placeName>, until ordered to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="GA11">Eleventh Georgia</orgName> is the right center regiment of the brigade, and went into action in its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>The advance was made in good order, and upon reaching the belt of woods in front a vigorous fire was opened upon the enemy, followed up by a vigorous charge, which dislodged them from the woods, the ravine and from a stone fence running diagonally with the line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>This formidable position was occupied by the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA11">Eleventh Georgia</orgName>, and a galling fire opened upon the enemy's front and flank, causing his line to recoil in confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>At this juncture <persName n="Anderson,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0270.0014.00202.01770" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,A.,A.,G.,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> came in person to the regiment (a considerable distance in advance of the remainder of the brigade, and in strong position, which was at the time held, and might have been held against the enemy in front) and ordered <persName n="Little,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0014.00202.01771" reg="nearbymention:Little,F.,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Little</surname></persName> to withdraw the regiment to the crest of the hill, on account of a movement of the enemy in force upon the left flank of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>The regiment retired in good order, though with loss, to the point indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>After a short interval a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> advance was made to the stone fence, but, after a furious conflict, the failure of support on the right forced the brigade back a distance of <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>This rout was vigorously pressed to the very foot of the mountain, up the sides of which the enemy fled in greatest confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>The loss of the enemy was here very great, his dead lying upon the field by the <num value="100">hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>Nothing but the exhausted condition of the men prevented them from carrying the heights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>As it was, with no supports of fresh troops, and with the knowledge that the enemy were pouring reinforcements from their right into the ledges of the mountain, it was found impracticable to follow him further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>Here the regiment, though exhausted by the extreme heat and by long continued exertion, performed without a murmur, but on the contrary with the greatest enthusiasm, much hard marching and fighting, as the enemy's mounted men frequently changed their point of attack, which rendered a change of position on our part also often necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>This regiment was at the time some distance to the right of the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX1">First Texas</orgName>, and at a point which was not then menaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>I, therefore, led the regiment to the battery at a double-quick, something more than half a mile off, and while going there received, through <persName n="Sellers,Major,,,," id="n0270.0014.00205.01789" reg="mostcommon:Sellers,W.,,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Sellers</surname></persName>, an order directing me to do so.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>On the night of the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th</day></dateStruct>, in riding around my lines, I found the artillery which had occupied a position at the salient&mdash;a point which with artillery was strong, but without it weak&mdash;leaving the trenches and moving to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>I inquired the cause of the moving, and was informed that it was in obedience to orders, and that a general move of troops was contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/>About the same time, or soon after, scouts and officers on the picket-line and brigade-commanders informed me that the enemy were moving to the right and concentrating in my front, and all concurred in the opinion that my lines would be assaulted in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>I concurred in this opinion, and communicated the facts that led me to believe that I would be attacked to you about <num value="12">twelve</num>, or between <time value="10">ten</time> and <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> on the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="2">11th</day></dateStruct>, at the same time requesting that the artillery which had been withdrawn should be sent back to its original position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>At the same time I ordered my command to be on the alert&mdash;some brigades to be awake all night, and <hi rend="italics">all</hi> to be up and in the trenches an hour or so before daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>This order was obeyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation of the advance of the enemy I went to the trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>Soon after my arrival there a heavy column assaulted my right, <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Steuart,,,,," id="n0270.0016.00240.02243" reg="nearbymention:Steuart,G.,H.,,"><surname>Steuart</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, which, after a fierce conflict, was repulsed, with the assistance of <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>Immediately after this a very heavy column debouched from the pines about half or <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile from my works, and advanced upon the salient held by <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0270.0016.00240.02244" reg="nearbymention:Jones,J.,M.,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>I then found that the artillery which had withdrawn the night previous had not returned, but looking, I saw it just coming in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>I dismounted, went into the trenches, collected all the men possible to hold the enemy in check until the artillery could get into position and open upon this column, which came up in large numbers, but in great disorder, with a narrow front, but extending back to the rear as far as I could see. I ordered the artillery to drive up at a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>They did so. The enemy were held in check somewhat by the infantry fire, but the artillery did not <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> get into position, nor did it fire a shot upon this column before they were captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>I felt confident that a few shots would disperse this force, which offered so fine a mark to artillery; hence I remained to the last, endeavoring to check them until the artillery could get into position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>There was no surprise; my men were up and in the trenches, prepared for the assault, before the enemy made his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assault on the right, where [were] <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery and <num value="1">one</num> brigade, was handsomely repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>The main attack must have been repulsed, had any artillery [been] on the line, which could have possibly swept the ground over which they advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>He was self-reliant always, obedient when he chose to be, impatient of drill and discipline, critical of great movements and small movements, the conduct of the highest and lowest officers, from <persName n="Robert,,Mars,,," id="n0270.0018.00261.02550" reg="default:Robert,Mars,,,"><foreName>Mars</foreName> <surname>Robert</surname></persName> down to the new-fledged lieutenant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3627"/>He was proud of his regiment, scornful of odds, uncomplaining of fatigue, ungrumbling at short rations, full of strange drollery and mockery at suffering.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3628"/>Such was the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier between &lsquo;<num value="61">61</num> and &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num>, before battle and disease had swept away the flower of the <rs>Southern</rs> youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>He had the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;lan</hi> of the <name>Frenchman</name>, the rollicking humor of the <name>Irishman</name>, the steadfastness of the <name>Englishman</name> or <name>German</name>, and the dogged perseverance of the <name>Scotchman</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>He had the best characteristics of the best fighters of the best races of the whole earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>The independence of a country life, hunting, fishing and the mastery of slaves, gave him large individuality and immense trust in himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>Hence he was unsurpassed and unsurpassable as a scout and on the skirmish line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>Of the shoulder-to-shoulder courage, born of drill and discipline, he knew nothing, and cared less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>Hence, on the battlefield, he was more of a free lance than a machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/>He knew when a movement was false and a position was untenable, and he was too little of a machine to give in such cases that whole-hearted service which might have redeemed the blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>The other evil was an ever-growing <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3643"/>His disregard of discipline and independence of character made him often a straggler, and the fruit of many a victory was lost by straggling.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3645"/>But too many of these officers were looking for political preferment after the war to permit a uniform system of government to become practical and possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3646"/>We needed, too, what our enemies had, an old army, a body of veterans, as a model of obedience, and as a nucleus for the formation of other troops like unto themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3652"/>Even after the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> the question of returning to the old flint-lock was seriously discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3653"/>The spinningwheel and the handloom were the chief dependence for furnishing clothing to the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>There was not in all the <rs>South</rs> a factory for making blankets for the soldiers, who had to endure the bitter rigors of the winter in the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>We had no ships upon the ocean to draw supplies from abroad, while our enemies could recruit their armies and their war material from the continents of the whole globe and from the far off isles of the sea. From <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, ours was the worst equipped, the worst fed, the worst clothed, and the worst organized army in the world; that of our enemy was the best equipped, the best organized, the best cared for, and the most pampered army of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>It is the grandest tribute that mortal man can pay to our soldiery to say that they knew of the tremendous difference between their condition and that of their foes, and <hi rend="italics">that they were contemptuous of it</hi>.

<p>These were the elements which shaped <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s distinctive characteristics as a soldier and commander which may be most concisely stated: a natural genius for the art of war, without which no professional training will ever develop the highest order of military talent; a power of abstraction and self-concentration which enabled him to determine every proper combination and disposition of his forces, without the slightest mental confusion&mdash;even in those supreme moments when his face and form underwent a sort of transfiguration amid the flame and thunder of battle; a conviction of the moral superiority of aggressive over defensive warfare in elevating the courage of his own men and in depressing that of the enemy; an almost intuitive insight into the plans of the enemy, and an immediate perception of the time to strike the most stunning blow, from the most unlooked &mdash; for quarter; a conviction of the necessity of following every such blow with another, and more terrible, so as to make every success a victory, and every victory so complete as to compel the speedy termination of the war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4507"/>At the mention of his name, another idea inseparably associated with it invariably asserts its place in the mental portraiture which all men acquainted with his history have formed of him; and so I announce as the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> and last explanation of the homage awarded him, the sincerity, the purity, and the elevation of his character as a servant of the <rs>Most High</rs> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4508"/>No <num value="1">one</num> acquainted with the moral history of the world can for a moment doubt that religious veneration is at once the profoundest and most universal of human instincts; and however individual men may chafe at the restraints which piety imposes, or be indifferent to its obligations, yet there is a sentiment in the popular heart which compels its homage for those whose character and lives most faithfully reflect the beauty of the <rs>Divine Image</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4509"/><pb id="p.326" n="326"/></p> 
<p>When a man already eminent by great virtues and services, attains great eminence in piety and wears the coronal of Heaven on his brow, because the spirit of Heaven has found its home in his heart, then the world, involuntarily, or with hearty readiness, places him on a higher pedestal, because with their love and admiration for the attractive qualities of the man, there is mingled a veneration for the ennobling graces of the <rs>Christian</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4511"/>He was distinguished before faith became an element in his life; and even after his faith attained its fullest development, it did not secure the triumph of the cause to which his life was a sacrifice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4512"/>But this I say, that his piety heightened every virtue, gave direction and force to every blow it struck for that cause, and then consecration to the sacrifice when he laid down his life on the altar of his country's liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4513"/>He was purer, stronger, more courageous, more efficient because of his piety; purer, because penitence strains the soul of the corruptions which defile it; stronger, because faith nerves the arm that takes hold on omnipotence; more courageous, because hope gives exaltation to the heroism of <num value="1">one</num> who fights with the crown of life ever in view; more efficient, because religion, which is but another name for the right use of <num value="1">one</num>'s own faculties, preserves them all in harmonious balance, develops all in symmetrical proportion, and by freeing them from the warping power of prejudice, the blinding power of passion, and the debasing slavery of evil habits, gives them all wholesome exercise, trains them all to keep step to the music of duty, and inspires them with an energy which is both intense and rightly directed.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>It is still more refreshing to note, that at this day, when scientific men assert such an unvarying uniformity in the operations of the laws of nature as to discredit prophecy, and deny miracle and silence prayer, that he whose studies had lain almost exclusively in the realm of the exact sciences, was a firm believer in the supernatural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/>Well did this humble pupil in the school of the <name>Great Teacher</name>&mdash;this diligent <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> student in the school of physical science&mdash;know that true progress was not mere advance in inventions and in arts, or in subsidizing the forces of nature to human uses, but that true progress was the progress of man himself&mdash;man, as distinct from anything external to himself.

<p>The death of every soldier who fell in our Confederate war is a protest against that base philosophy <q direct="unspecified">which would make physical good man's highest good, and which would attempt to rear a noble commonwealth on mere material foundations.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>If we now call the roll of the worthies who have given to the world its valued treasures of thought or faith, or who have subdued nature or developed art, it will be found that nearly all of them were in a life-long grapple with defeat and disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>As an officer, charged with his custody, I saw that he was at all times and by all persons treated kindly, properly and respectfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>I have no recollection that there ever was any attempt made to humiliate or maltreat him. <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0270.0021.00340.03346" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> took many occasions to thank me for my kindness to him, and spoke of it to many persons, including his wife.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/><num value="3">3</num>. The statement that <q direct="unspecified">he kissed a negro child in its mother's arms,</q> is wholly incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>Nothing of this sort occurred.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5075"/>At about <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5076"/>On advancing, I found him with his brigade hotly engaged with a superior force of the enemy's infantry, aided by a battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5077"/>The place was on the <placeName key="tgn,7017496" n="1.000 4" reg="chattanooga, hamilton, tennessee">Chattanooga</placeName> road near a small house, and a smaller outhouse with open ground for <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> or <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> in front and stretching to the right and left, through which ran the road from front to rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5078"/>Beyond the open ground all was forest, in which, on the right of the road, was the enemy's battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5079"/>Thus the missiles from this battery not only swept over nearly all of the open ground, but passed on with effect far into the level wood in the rear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5080"/>When we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encountered the enemy, they were at the <num value="2">two</num> houses and on the rear side of the open ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5081"/>After an obstinate contest they were driven from this position and across the open ground into the road beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5082"/>We then occupied the houses&mdash;my numbers were too few to venture with them alone to follow the enemy into the wood, and to the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5083"/>The place we held was much exposed to the enemy's fire, but with the little cover furnished by the houses, some stumps, and a few scattered trees, I thought I could hold it till the reinforcements every minute expected should arrive, when a general advance might be expected and the enemy swept from the opposite wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/>We did hold it for a long time driving back several charges of the enemy to retake it. No reinforcements came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5085"/>Finally, towards sunset, the enemy's fire from his battery and from his infantry, protected by the wood, became so heavy, and so many of our officers and men had fallen, that we had ourselves to retire a short distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/>We accordingly took up a new position a <num value="100">hundred</num> or <measure n="2yards" type="distance">two yards</measure> in rear of the houses, where we remained till the close of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>We, in this engagement, felt much the want of artillery to oppose, not only the enemy's artillery, but to his infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5088"/>But none came to our aid. None had been attached either to my brigade or to <persName n="Robertson,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0270.0024.00373.03646" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,C.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5089"/>In the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 20">Twentieth regiment</orgName> <num value="17">seventeen</num> officers out of <num value="23">twenty-three</num> were killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>In the other regiments, the proportion though not so great, was very great.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/>The proportionate loss among the men was but little less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>The command fought with a dogged resolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>On the next day the brigade was in line a little to the right of the place where it had fought the day before and a short distance in the rear of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0270.0024.00374.03647" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>At about <time value="12mid">12 o'clock M.</time>, I was ordered to follow and support that brigade at the distance of from <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>At the same time I saw the enemy in considerable force on his right, apparently preparing to attack his flank and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>I immediately changed the direction of march by bearing to the right and advancing my left so as to face the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>I then marched upon them and attacked them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>After a sharp contest they gave way and we pursued them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>They made a stand at some artillery in the woods, but were driven again from this position and pursued several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> beyond the guns, where they disappeared in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>In a short time they returned in heavy force and made a desperate effort to recover their ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>Here there was a very obstinate fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5102"/>At length I saw them turning my right to get into my rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5103"/>We then fell back behind the cannon, facing so as to meet this new demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/>The enemy followed a short distance, but not fast enough to retake the artillery, and for some time kept up with us at long range an artillery fire, and finally they disappeared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/>The artillery taken consisted of <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/>According to my account there were <num value="8">eight</num>&mdash;<num value="4">four</num> brass and <num value="4">four</num> iron pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>Some of the officers thought there were only <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/>A flag was also taken with the guns.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5227"/><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>,&mdash;I have the honor to respectfully submit my report of the part taken by my brigade in the action of the <dateStruct value="-09-19"><day reg="19">19th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-09-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5228"/>My duties in the field have precluded me from submitting my report at an earlier period After having remained in line of battle from daybreak until near <time value="3pm">three o'clock P. M.</time>, I was ordered to take position on the left of <persName n="Sheffield,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0024.00384.03810" reg="mostcommon:Sheffield,J.,L.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Sheffield</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0270.0024.00384.03811" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> (General Law being in command of the division). This placed me on the extreme left of our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5229"/>On receiving the order to advance and attack the enemy, I was directed to keep closed on <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0270.0024.00384.03812" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5230"/>I had not advanced more than <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> until the enemy was reported appearing on my left and endangering my left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5231"/><persName n="Manning,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0024.00384.03813" reg="mostcommon:Manning,H.,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Manning</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName type="regiment" key="AR3">Third Arkansas</orgName>, my left regiment, was ordered to change front with <num value="2">two</num> companies, and meet them, I believing at the moment that it was a small force sent to make a diversion by threatening my flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5232"/>Before these dispositions were completed, my line had passed the crest of the hill, and I discovered the enemy in heavy force on my left, and they opened a heavy fire upon me. I sent a staff officer to inform General Law of it. He sent me orders to change front and meet them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5233"/>This made it necessary for me to change my front forward on left battalion, which was done promptly under a heavy fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5234"/>To do this I had necessarily to detach my brigade from General Law's. I sent a courier to inform him of the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5235"/>My line steadily advanced, the enemy stubbornly contesting every inch of ground until I reached the fence that divides the <num value="2">two</num> fields on the crest of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5236"/>The thick woods through which my <num value="2">two</num> right regiments, <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="TX5">Fifth Texas</orgName>, advanced, prevented me from knowing what was on my right, and I was advancing in a direction that separated me from the left of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0270.0024.00384.03814" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, thus leaving a considerable space uncovered and exposing my right flank I determined to hold this, if possible, until I could be reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5237"/>As soon as we reached the hill and drove the enemy from it, he opened upon us with grape and canister from <num value="2">two</num> batteries, both of which raked the <pb id="p.385" n="385"/> hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5238"/>Seeing that my force was too weak to hold the hill with my loss momentarily increasing, I ordered them to fall back just behind the crest of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5239"/>On seeing this the enemy pushed forward his infantry to the crest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5240"/>As soon as they appeared on the hill they were charged and driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5241"/>In this charge I had <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role" reg="regimental-Commander">regimental commanders</rs> wounded, whilst gallantly leading and cheering their men on, viz: <persName n="Rogers,Major,J.,C.,," id="n0270.0024.00385.03815" reg="default:Rogers,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="TX5">Fifth Texas</orgName>; <persName n="Bane,Lieutenant-Colonel,J.,P.,," id="n0270.0024.00385.03816" reg="default:Bane,J.,P.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Bane</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="TX4">Fourth Texas</orgName>, and <persName n="Rice,Captain,D.,K.,," id="n0270.0024.00385.03817" reg="default:Rice,D.,K.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>K.</foreName> <surname>Rice</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="TX1">First Texas</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5242"/>Immediately upon reaching the hill, I sent a courier for reinforcements and a staff officer for a battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5243"/><persName n="Benning,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0270.0024.00385.03818" reg="nearbymention:Benning,Henry,L.,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> came up promptly with his brigade, and with his usual gallantry assisted in holding our position until nightfall, when we were moved, by order of General Law, to our position on the left of the division, relieving <persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0270.0024.00385.03819" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,T.,C.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName>, where we bivouacked for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5244"/>I sent <num value="3">three</num> different messengers for a battery, all of which returned without any. I then went myself, but could not get the officer in command of the only <num value="1">one</num> I could find to bring his battery up. I have no hesitation in believing that if I could have got a battery in position, that we could have inflicted heavy loss on the enemy, as his infantry was massed in heavy columns at the far end of the field from us. Early in the action, and while the <orgName type="regiment" key="AR3">Third Arkansas</orgName>, my left regiment, was driving the enemy in superior numbers before it, the gallant <persName n="Reidy,Major,,,," id="n0270.0024.00385.03820" reg="mostcommon:Reidy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Reidy</surname></persName>, of that regiment, fell mortally wounded whilst leading his men with his usual coolness and daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5245"/>At daylight on the morning of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> we were moved by the right flank to our position, where we remained until about <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, when we were ordered to move forward in the rear of General <orgName n="Law's Brigade"><persName n="Law,Brigade,,,," id="n0270.0024.00385.03821" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigade"></roleName><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>On reaching an open field, our troops in my immediate front were heavily engaged, and just as I reached the open field they charged and took a battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>There was also heavy firing on my extreme right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/><persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0270.0024.00385.03822" reg="nearbymention:Benning,Henry,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName>, on whose left I had started, had been detached before I reached the field, and moved to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/>On looking to my right I found that there was a considerable space between our forces on the left and those on the right, occupied by the enemy, and I determined to engage them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>I moved my brigade by the right flank to the proper point, and then changed my front forward on <orgName type="regiment" key="1Battalion">first battalion</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5251"/>I, at the same time, sent messengers to the forces lying in the field on my right, and requested their commander to join my right and advance with me, and <num value="1">one</num> to those on my left, requesting that they join me on my left and advance with me. These messages I sent <num value="3">three</num> different times as I advanced <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> through the field, but they failed to do so. I advanced to the top of the hill and drove the enemy from it. After holding the hill a few moments, pouring a destructive fire into his fleeing columns in my front, a fire was opened on both my right and left flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>This fire, I believe, came from our own men in the rear of my flanks, the same that I had asked to advance with me, but before I could stop it my line had been thrown into confusion, and I found it necessary to fall back to reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>As I fell back, and just as I reached the timber, observing <persName n="Hood,Major-General,,,," id="n0270.0024.00386.03823" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, I rode up to him to get orders, but just as I was at the point of addressing him, he was wounded and carried from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>Believing that I could not retake and hold the position on the hill alone, and having failed to get the cooperation of the only forces in reach, I formed my brigade in the timber and awaited orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>On reporting to General Law, I was ordered to form on the left of the division and throw up temporary works in my front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5256"/>In the aforesaid charge, I lost some of my best officers, among them <persName n="Bookman,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0024.00386.03824" reg="mostcommon:Bookman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenants</roleName> <surname>Bookman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Killigsworth,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0024.00386.03825" reg="mostcommon:Killigsworth,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant"></roleName><surname>Killigsworth</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX4">Fourth Texas</orgName>; <persName n="Billingsly,Captain,,,," id="n0270.0024.00386.03826" reg="mostcommon:Billingsly,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Billingsly</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX4">Fourth Texas</orgName>, and <persName n="Streitman,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0024.00386.03827" reg="mostcommon:Streitman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Streitman</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX5">Fifth Texas</orgName>, and <persName n="Worthington,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0024.00386.03828" reg="mostcommon:Worthington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Worthington</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="AR3">Third Arkansas</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5766"/>When the line had reached the enemy's works, some <num value="200">two hundred</num> men having got into a re-entering angle where they were exposed to a severe cross-fire, became confused, and a mounted officer of the enemy galloping out of a sally port, seized the colors of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 27">Twenty-seventh Regiment</orgName> and called upon them to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5881"/><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>,&mdash;I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this regiment since the <dateStruct value="-05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> last:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5882"/>On the morning of that day we confronted the enemy at the <rs>Wilderness</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5883"/>After getting into position, I was instructed by <persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n0270.0031.00434.04453" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>, commanding brigade, to support, if necessary, the regiment of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Kershaw,General,,,," id="n0270.0031.00434.04454" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,J.,B.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> immediately on my front, then hotly engaged with the enemy, and shortly afterwards, receiving a message from the officer commanding the regiment, stating that his ammunition was nearly exhausted, and requesting me to relieve him, I moved forward and occupied his position, his men retiring on my arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5884"/>The woods were very dense, shutting out all view, excepting a short distance in front of my line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5885"/>The timid firing of the enemy led me to suspect that he was not in heavy force, and to ascertain the truth of my suspicions, I threw forward <num value="2">two</num> (<num value="2">2</num>) companies as skirmishers, with orders to press the enemy back if practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5886"/>This they accomplished without much difficulty, driving him until their flanks were threatened, when I ordered a halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5887"/>In this movement I was not supported on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5888"/>I immediately dispatched a message to <persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n0270.0031.00434.04455" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>, informing him of the state of affairs, and requesting supports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5889"/>These never arrived, but in the meantime a movement was put in execution on the right, which rendered them unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5890"/>The enemy was driven off by an attack in flank.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5891"/>Later in the day, after considerable delay in unnecessary manoeuvring, we arrived in front of the new position the enemy had taken up after his morning's discomfiture, and prepared to attack him. I was ordered to be governed by <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Coward,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0031.00434.04456" reg="mostcommon:Coward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Coward</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName> (the battalion of direction.) The movement began; I holding fast to <persName n="Coward,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0031.00434.04457" reg="mostcommon:Coward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Coward</surname></persName>, who, instead of advancing directly to the point, obliqued considerably to the left, in conformity with the direction taken by the troops on his left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5892"/>We were met by a heavy volley from the enemy, which, for a moment, staggered our line, causing some confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5893"/>We, however, quickly recovered, and continued <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> the advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5894"/>I here discovered that the regiment which should have moved on my right was not there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5895"/>In the density of the forest, I concluded it had temporarily gotten lost, and I gave no more thought to it. Under a destructive fire I attained the enemy's works, and drove him from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5896"/>He retired to a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, keeping up a terrific fusilade, assisted by several pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5897"/>The regiment alluded to a few lines back, was still missing, my men and ammunition almost exhausted&mdash;I deemed it inexpedient to attempt anything further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5898"/>I abandoned this position only when the troops on my left gave way, (there were none on my right during any part of the advance), and the enemy threatened to cut me off. No further attack was made during the day. I carried into action <num value="26">twenty-six</num> officers and <num value="235">two hundred and thirty-five</num> men; lost <num value="2">two</num> (<num value="2">2</num>) officers killed and <num value="3">three</num> (<num value="3">3</num>) wounded, <num value="8">eight</num> (<num value="8">8</num>) men killed and <num value="79">seventy-nine</num> (<num value="79">79</num>) wounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5899"/>Slight skirmishing lasted during the <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num> and <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num> ultimos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5900"/>On the night of the latter day we took up the line of march for <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Courthouse">Spotsylvania Courthouse</placeName>, which we reached early on the following morning after an exhaustive night march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5901"/>Everything was gotten in readiness to attack the enemy, who had arrived here at the same time with us. We advanced, but failed to find him in the direction originally taken, when we changed front and pursued a course at right angles with the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5902"/>We shortly began skirmishing, which was kept up until night put a stop to it. On the next day we moved a short distance to the left, and erected a line of temporary works of fallen trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5903"/>On the morning of the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> the enemy assaulted our position, but was repulsed after a sharp contest of an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5904"/>My skirmish line, slightly reinforced, held its position throughout the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5905"/>More or less skirmishing occurred during the following day. On the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="2">12th</day></dateStruct> the enemy made a more determined attack, which was met with great gallantry by our men, and repulsed after several hours of hard fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5906"/>The density of the woods, the smoke and other causes prevented me from ascertaining the moment of the enemy's withdrawal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5907"/>I, therefore, advanced my skirmishers, assisted on my left by <persName n="Lyle,Captain,,,," id="n0270.0031.00435.04458" reg="mostcommon:Lyle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName type="regiment" key="SC5">Fifth South Carolina</orgName>, and succeeded in capturing <num value="17">seventeen</num> or <num value="18">eighteen</num> of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5908"/>A few days later the enemy abandoned our front, when we were transferred to the right extremity of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5909"/>Nothing worthy of report occurred here until the night of the <dateStruct value="-05-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, when we evacuated our lines and moved in the direction of <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover Junction</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5910"/>I began the action of <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Courthouse">Spotsylvania Courthouse</placeName> with <num value="21">twenty-one</num> officers and <pb id="p.436" n="436"/> <num value="148">one hundred and forty-eight</num> men; lost <num value="1">one</num> (I) officer killed and <num value="3">three</num> (<num value="3">3</num>) wounded, <num value="2">two</num> (<num value="2">2</num>) men killed and <num value="16">sixteen</num> (<num value="16">16</num>) wounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5911"/>We remained at <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover Junction</placeName> from the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th ultimo</day></dateStruct> until about the <num value="25" type="ordinal">25th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5912"/>During this time we were engaged in several sharp skirmishes, resulting in the loss to my regiment of <num value="1">one</num> (I) officer wounded and <num value="1">one</num> (I) man killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5913"/>We next moved to the <q direct="unspecified">lines of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>,</q> where, after considerable manoeuvring, we finally became established in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5914"/>On the <dateStruct value="-06-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> we had a sharp skirmish with the enemy with loss of <num value="1">one</num> man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5915"/>We abandoned these lines on the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> and marched to the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Frazier's Farm">Frazier's Farm</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5916"/>On the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="2">14th</day></dateStruct>, we crossed to the south side, and on the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> engaged the enemy at <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundreds">Bermuda Hundreds</placeName>, driving him from a position he occupied on <placeName reg="Walthall Creek, Freestone, Texas" key="tgn,2750116">Walthall Creek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5917"/>On the <dateStruct value="-06-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> we arrived at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and were put in trenches on the <rs type="place">Baxter Road</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5918"/>From this time until the <dateStruct value="-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, we were constantly on duty and under fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5919"/>My loss from the enemy's sharpshooters amounted to <num value="2">two</num> (<num value="2">2</num>) officers killed and <num value="1">one</num> (<num value="1">1</num>) wounded, and <num value="4">four</num> (<num value="4">4</num>) men killed and <num value="10">ten</num> (<num value="10">10</num>) wounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5920"/><dateStruct value="-07-21"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct> we were transferred back to the north side to the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Deep Bottom, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2280567">Deep Bottom</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5921"/>We occupied a line, the left extremity of which rested on <placeName reg="New Market Heights">New Market Heights</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5922"/>On the <dateStruct value="-08-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, the enemy attacked our position in heavy force, breaking the skirmish line of the regiment on my left, and penetrating to a point in the rear of my skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5923"/>My left company was thus cut off and, with the exception of <num value="1">one</num> man, captured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5924"/>After shelling our position heavily for an hour, he withdrew, and shifted his forces towards our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5925"/>We executed a corresponding movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5926"/>On the following day, brisk skirmishing ensued, but my regiment was not regularly engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5927"/>My losses in the aggregate amounted to <num value="3">three</num> (<num value="3">3</num>) men wounded, and <num value="1">one</num> (<num value="1">1</num>) officer and, <num value="18">eighteen</num> (<num value="18">18</num>) men missing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5928"/>On the <dateStruct value="-08-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> we returned to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and were engaged until the <dateStruct value="-09-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> in throwing up field-works in its vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5929"/>On that day the enemy attacked <orgName n="Battery Harrison" type="battery">Battery Harrison</orgName>, near <placeName reg="Chaffin's Bluff">Chaffin's Bluff</placeName>, and carried it by storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5930"/>We were immediately ordered to that point, and arrived on the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="2">29th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5931"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="--30"><day reg="30">30th</day></dateStruct>, preparations were made to regain the fort which lasted until midday, when the attack began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5932"/>We were then a <num value="1000">thousand</num> (<num value="1000">1,000</num>) yards from the point to be carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/>Immediately the regiment on my left began to double-quick, which soon increased to a run, thus exhausting <pb id="p.437" n="437"/> the men and wasting their energies at a time when both should have been economized for the struggle on the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5934"/>I was opposed to this; but believing it to be an order, acquiesced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5935"/>The enemy shortly opened fire on us, which increased in effect every moment, and soon began to tell fearfully on the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5936"/>At this critical moment, the brigade which preceded us gave way, and rushing through our line caused irremediable confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5937"/>Added to this, the village of soldiers' huts, which lay in our track, offered the temptation to skulk, which many failed to resist, and which was impossible, in the confusion, to prevent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5938"/>With those of my men who still adhered to their colors, I continued to advance until I attained a point within <num value="60">sixty</num> (<num value="60">60</num>) yards of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5939"/>Here, owing to the little support which was accorded to me by the remainder of the brigade, I ordered my regiment to halt, and began firing, to divert my men. I awaited here <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> for reinforcements, but their failure to come up, and the fearful destructiveness of the enemy's fire, impressed me with the necessity of falling back, which I accordingly did. I rallied my men at the earliest practicable moment, and reported to the <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</rs> commanding, who instructed me to return to my position of the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5940"/>A short time afterwards, I was ordered to advance again on the enemy, bearing to the left, so as to strike his works on the right of <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Walker,Colonel,,,," id="n0270.0031.00437.04459" reg="mostcommon:Walker,J.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName>, which was reported as having gained them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5941"/>I executed this order, but discovered no enemy this side of the fort; the flank-work having been manned by only a line of skirmishers who were driven from it by <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0270.0031.00437.04460" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> before the arrival of <persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n0270.0031.00437.04461" reg="mostcommon:Walker,J.,C.,,:1"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5942"/>After dark we were withdrawn to our old position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5943"/>My losses in this engagement amounted to <num value="3">three</num> officers and <num value="10">ten</num> men killed, <num value="9">nine</num> officers and <num value="62">sixty-two</num> men wounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5944"/><measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> later, we threw up a line of works in advance of our old position.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6198"/>He rode his favorite horse, Traveller, a superb iron gray, so well-known in the army, and his seat in the saddle was the perfection of firmness and manly grace.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6211"/>Sir,&mdash;Along with this you will receive your letter of credence to the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to which the <rs>President</rs> desires you to present yourself as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6212"/>Our claims for recognition as an independent people have been made much stronger by events which have occurred since they were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> presented by our Commissioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6213"/>But before reinforcing those claims, you will not fail to place the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in their true position before the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6214"/>You will show that they are not to be considered as revolted provinces or rebellious subjects seeking to overthrow, by revolutionary violence, the just authority of a lawful sovereign, but, on the contrary, they stand before the world as organized parties, maintaining their right to self-government, with sufficient strength to make good their claim, and so organized as to be morally and politically responsible for their actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6215"/>Their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> union was formed by a compact between sovereign and independent States, upon covenants and conditions expressly stipulated in a written instrument called the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6216"/>In that union the <name>States</name> constituted the units or integers, and were bound to it only because the people of each of them acceded to it in their separate capacities, through the acts of their representatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6217"/>That confederacy was designed to unite under <num value="1">one</num> government <num value="2">two</num> great and diverse social systems, under <num value="1">one</num> or the other of which all the <name>States</name> might be classified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6218"/>As these <num value="2">two</num> social systems were unequally represented in the common government, it was sought to protect <num value="1">one</num> against a warfare which might be waged by the other through the forms of law, by carefully defined restrictions and limitations upon the power of the majority in the common government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6219"/>Without such restrictions and limitations, it is known historically that the union could not <pb id="p.456" n="456"/> have been formed originally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6220"/>But the dominant majority, which at last proved to be sectional in its character, not only used the machinery of a government which they wielded to plunder the minority, through unequal legislation in the shape of protective tariffs and appropriations made for their own benefit, but proceeding from step to step they waged through the forms of law a war upon the social system of the slaveholding States and threatened, when fully armed with political power, to use the <rs>Government</rs> itself to disturb the domestic peace of those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6221"/>Finding that the covenants and conditions upon which the <rs>Union</rs> was formed were not only persistently violated, but that the common government itself, then entirely in the hands of a sectional majority, was to be used for the purposes of warring upon the domestic institutions which it was bound by express stipulations to protect, <num value="11">eleven</num> of the slaveholding States felt it to be due to themselves to withdraw from a Union, when the conditions upon which it was formed either had been or were certainly about to be violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6222"/>They were thus compelled to withdraw from a government which not only abdicated its duty to protect the domestic institutions of <num value="15">fifteen</num> States, but on the <num value="1">one</num> hand threatened those institutions with war, and on the other withheld from the people interested in them the means of self defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6223"/>The <num value="11">eleven</num> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were thus forced, in self defence, to abandon a Union whose ends were thus perverted, not from any passion for novelty, or from any change of purpose, but to attain, under a new Confederacy of more homogeneous materials and interests, the very ends and objects for which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6224"/>It was amongst the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these objects to obtain a government whose authority should rest upon the assent of the governed, and whose action should represent also their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6225"/>It was for the sacred right of self-government that they have been forced to take up arms, and not to escape the just obligations incurred under the compact upon which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Union was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6226"/>On the contrary, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was to send commissioners to the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to adjust amicably and fairly all questions of property and responsibility which had been jointly acquired or incurred by all the <name>States</name> when embraced in the same Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6227"/>The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> refused to receive these commissioners, the authority of their Government was denied, their people were denounced as Rebels, and threatened with coercion at the point of the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6228"/>On the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the war in its inception was <num value="1">one</num> of self defence, and it has been waged since by them with no other <pb id="p.457" n="457"/> end than to maintain their right to self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6229"/>It is in the name of the sacred right of self-government, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> appear before the tribunal of the nations of the earth, and submit their claims for a recognized place amongst them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6230"/>They approach His Imperial Majesty of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> with the more confidence as he has lately championed this great cause in the recent <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName> question so much to the glory of himself and the great people over whom he rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6231"/>In asking for this recognition, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> believes that it seeks for no more than it offers in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6232"/>The establishment of diplomatic relations between nations tends to the protection of human intercourse by affording the means of a peaceful solution of all difficulties which may arise in its progress, and by facilitating a mutual interchange of good offices for the purpose of maintaining and extending it. In this, all nations have an interest, and the advantages of such an intercourse are mutual and reciprocal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6233"/>The only preliminary conditions to the recognition of a nation, seeking an acknowledged place in the world, would seem to be the existence of a sufficient strength within the government to support and maintain it, and such a social and political organization as will secure its responsibility for its international obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6234"/>It will be easy to show that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName> is fully able to meet the requisitions of these tests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6235"/>When we look to the undeveloped capacities, as well as the developed strength of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, we cannot doubt that they are destined to become the seat of a great empire at no distant day. The <num value="11">eleven</num> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> already comprise <num value="733144">733,144</num> square miles of territory, with a population of <num value="9244000">9,244,000</num> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6236"/>If to this we add the <num value="3">three</num> States of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, all of which will probably find themselves constrained, as well by interest as inclination, to unite their fortunes with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, then these will embrace a territory of <num value="830000">830,000</num> square miles, with a population of <num value="12.5">twelve and a half</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6237"/>This estimate excludes a large territory not yet organized into States, and which, in the end, will probably fall into the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6238"/>The territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, as they now stand, embraces all the best varieties of climate and production known to the temperate zone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6239"/>In addition to this, it produces the great staples of cotton, sugar, tobacco and rice, to say nothing of naval stores, which are now exported from it, and of provisions which it is capable of producing in excess of the wants of its people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6240"/>This vast region already enjoys through its rivers a great system of water communication, <pb id="p.458" n="458"/> and <measure n="8844miles" type="distance">8,844 miles</measure> of railroad running for the most part transversely to these rivers diversify and multiply the channels of commerce to such an extent as to promise a speedy development of the vast resources of the new empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6241"/>If peace were now established it is not extravagant to suppose that the exports of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> would, within a year, reach the value of <measure n="250000000dollars" type="currency">$250,000,000</measure>. With a crop of <num value="4500000">4,500,000</num>, or, perhaps, even <measure n="5000000barrels" type="mass">5,000,000 bales</measure> of cotton, most of which would be exported, together with its tobacco, sugar, rice, and naval stores, it would easily send abroad the value just named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6242"/>But without reference to its undeveloped capacities you may show that they have exhibited strength enough to maintain their independence against any power which has as yet assailed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6243"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> commenced this struggle with vast odds in their favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6244"/>The military and naval establishments were in their hands; they were also in possession of the prestige and machinery of an old and established government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6245"/>Many of the forts and strongholds of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were in their hands; they had most of the accumulated wealth of the country and nearly all the manufactories of the munitions of war, and even of the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6246"/>Add to all these advantages the greater population of that Union, and it is easy to see that the self supporting power of the new Confederacy has been exposed to the severest tests and rudest trials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6247"/>And yet the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> have conquered in every pitched battle, and that with great odds against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6248"/>At <placeName reg="Bethel, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2165061">Bethel</placeName> and <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas, in Virginia</placeName>, and at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield, in Missouri</placeName>, the <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName> have been routed at great loss and without dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6249"/>The foothold which the <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName> at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acquired within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is being rapidly lost, and the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> has given manifest evidences of its fears that its seat of government may be wrested from it. This exhibition of strength on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, which was so unexpected by its enemies, proves that its <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> is greater even than its physical resources for the purposes of this struggle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6250"/>Without an army and with a new government, whose necessary establishments were all to be formed in the midst of a civil war, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> not only manifested their military superiority in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pitched battles, but have already placed more than <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men in the field who are armed, equipped and regularly supplied by the necessary establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6251"/>These sprang into existence almost by the spontaneous efforts of the people, and came into the field faster even than the <rs>Government</rs> could prepare for <pb id="p.459" n="459"/> them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6252"/>But voluntary contributions and aid supplied all deficiencies until the necessary military establishments were formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6253"/>It would seem then that the new Confederacy has given all the evidence, in proof of its power to maintain its independence, which could reasonably be asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6254"/>That its organization is such as to ensure its responsibility for the discharge of international duties will also appear upon an impartial examination of the question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6255"/>The action of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in their separation from the old Union presents within itself the evidence of their persistency of purpose, and affords a guaranty for the stability of their institutions, so far as these may be dependent upon their own will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6256"/>They have preserved the same form of government which their forefathers established, with the exception of such changes alone as would make its machinery more suitable for the ends and purposes for which it was created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6257"/>It was not to change, but to preserve the ends and purposes for which the original constitution was adopted, that they separated from a union which had ceased to respect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6258"/>They have neither changed their form of government nor the objects for which it was framed; they have only changed the parties to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to secure a faithful execution of the compact upon which alone they were willing to unite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6259"/>The former Union had failed to accomplish its original ends for the want of a homogeneous character in the parties to it; and having left it for that cause, there can be no reason to expect its reconstruction with the same discordant elements whose jarring had destroyed it before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6260"/>The whole course then of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> argues a consistency of purpose and promises a stability for the government which they have formed, which, together with the resources already exhibited by them, give a reasonable assurance of their entire responsibility for the discharge of all their duties and obligations, domestic and international.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6261"/>A people who present themselves under such circumstances for a recognized place amongst nations would seem to be entitled to the grant of such a request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6262"/>They do not seek for material aid, or assistance, or for alliances, defensive and offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6263"/>They ask nothing which can endanger the peace or prosperity of those who may grant it. They desire only to be placed in a position in which their intercourse with the rest of the world may be conducted with the sanction of public law, and under the protection of agents whose authority is recognized by nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6264"/>They seek the moral influence which the act of recognition may give them, and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6265"/>If it be manifest that the war of conquest now waged against them cannot succeed, then the <pb id="p.460" n="460"/> act of recognition is a mere question of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6266"/>If the fact be as stated, the tendency of the act of recognition would be to prevent the further continuance of an unnecessary war and the useless effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6267"/>It may well be doubted, if under such circumstances the nation which thus refuses to throw the moral weight of its influence in the scale of peace, does not share in some of the responsibilities for the continuance of an unnecessary war, which it might have done something to conclude without risk or injury to itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6268"/>Indeed, it may be said without exaggeration that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> has a deep material and political interest in the establishment of the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6269"/>It is the event of all others which would give the most satisfactory solution to the great question of cotton supply for the manufacturing nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6270"/>That the great source of the production of this raw material which enters so largely into the manufacturing industry of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> has been found in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName> is an undoubted fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6271"/>That this will continue to be the case for a long time to come is in every way probable, for no other country presents the same combination of soil, climate and trained labor which is all essential to the successful production of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6272"/>If our country is to be the great source for the supply of this article so indispensable to the manufacturing industry of the world, the nations of the earth have the deepest interest in placing it in a position of independence and impartiality in regard to the distribution of the raw material for which the demand is so immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6273"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> country is to have a virtual monopoly of the supply of raw cotton, then the world would have the deepest interest in opening it to the easy and equal access of all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6274"/>Such would be the case, if the depository of this great interest should be found in a country on the <num value="1">one</num> hand strong enough to maintain its neutrality and independence, and on the other committed by its interests to the policy of Free Trade and an untrammeled intercourse with all the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6275"/>Such would be the precise position of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> when once their independence was achieved; and as a proof that this would be the natural tendency of their policy, we have only to look to their early legislation which reduced the duties on imports to the lowest rates consistent with their necessities for revenue, and opened their coasting trade to the free and equal competition of all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6276"/>Nor is cotton the only great staple of which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are likely to become not the sole, but <num value="1">one</num> of the chief depositories upon terms of equality to all the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6277"/>Tobacco, sugar, rice and naval stores are to be added to the catalogue <pb id="p.461" n="461"/> of their rich and important products.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6278"/>Nature has thus made it to their interest to buy where they can purchase cheapest, and to sell in as many markets as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6279"/>To do this, as they will deal more in raw produce than in manufactures, they will seek to take in return the commodities of the rest of the world on the payment of the lowest duties consistent with their revenue wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6280"/>They will then virtually stand as the customers, and not as the rivals, of the commercial and manufacturing nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6281"/>But there is another point of view in which the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> would more peculiarly interest <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6282"/>The immense development of her navy in a few years past, has shown not only that her capacity for asserting her equality on the seas has not been properly appreciated heretofore, but also that this relative capacity has been increased by the use of steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6283"/>In this view, the further development of her commercial marine, and an easy access to a cheap and certain supply of coal, iron, and naval stores, have become matters of primary importance to her. The commerce of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, when disembarrassed of the enormous protective tariffs to which it was subjected under the former Union, together with the almost inexhaustible supply of cheap coal, iron and naval stores which it could furnish, present the means for a further and vast development of the commercial and naval marine of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6284"/>She could then find as cheap ships, or as cheap raw material for the building of ships, as could be commanded by any <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6305"/></p> 
<p>The establishment of the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> would secure to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> large supplies of coal, iron and naval stores in exchange for her manufactures and other products beyond almost all the probable chances of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6306"/>It may almost be said that to secure the independence of these States, is to secure the independence of the great commercial and manufacturing nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in regard to the supplies of cotton and tobacco, and to give <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> such an independent source for the supply of cheap coal, iron and naval stores as to place her more nearly on terms of equality with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in building up a navy and merchant marine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6307"/>The <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> nations might then be said to be independent, so far as their supplies are concerned, because they would be dependent only on a country whose interests would open its markets to the cheap and easy access of all the world, and which would have every inducement to preserve the peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6308"/>But the independence of these States is essential to the certainty of supply and the <pb id="p.463" n="463"/> ease of access to their markets which are so important to the manufacturing and commercial nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6309"/>If it were possible for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to subdue the <rs>Confederates</rs> and subject them once more to their government, then <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> would have much cause for apprehension in regard to the future condition of her commerce and manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6310"/>The non-slaveholding States would undoubtedly use their control over the markets and staples of the <rs>South</rs> to secure a supremacy in commerce, navigation and manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6311"/>There are, also, political considerations, connected with this question, which cannot be uninteresting to the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6312"/>By the establishment of a great Southern Confederacy, a balance of power is secured in <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>, and schemes of conquest or annexation on the part of a great and overshadowing empire would probably no longer disturb the repose of neighboring nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6313"/>Heretofore the <rs>South</rs> has desired the annexation of territory suitable to the growth of her domestic institutions in order to establish a balance of power within the government that they might protect their interests and internal peace through its agency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6314"/>This reason no longer exists, as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have sought that protection by a separation from the <rs>Union</rs> in which their rights were endangered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6315"/>But with the establishment of something like a balance of power between the <num value="2">two</num> great and independent Confederacies, the disputes would precede the annexations and probably do much to prevent them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6316"/>Certain it is that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> would have every reason to preserve peace both at home and abroad, and would be prevented, both by its principles and interests, from intervention in the domestic affairs and government of other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6317"/>The power of that Confederacy would undoubtedly be felt not as a disturbing, but as a harmonizing influence amongst the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6318"/>There is yet another question of great practical importance to us and to the world which you will present on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proper occasion to His Imperial Majesty's Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6319"/>It was declared by the <num value="5">Five</num> Great Powers at the <name>Conference</name> of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, that <q direct="unspecified">blockades to be binding, must be effectual,</q> a principle long since sanctioned by leading publicists, and now acknowledged by nearly all civilized nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6320"/>You will be furnished with abundant evidence of the fact that the blockade of the coasts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has not been effectual or of such a character as to be binding, according to the declaration of the <name>Conference</name> at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6321"/>Such being the case, it may, perhaps, be fairly urged that the <num value="5">Five</num> Great Powers owe it to their own consistency <pb id="p.464" n="464"/> and to the world to make good a declaration thus solemnly made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6322"/>Propositions of such gravity and emanating from sources so high may fairly be considered as affecting the general business relations of human society, and as controlling in a great degree the calculations and arrangements of nations, so far as they are concerned, in the rules thus laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6323"/>Men have a right to presume that a law thus proclaimed will be uniformly enforced by those who have the power to do so, and who have taken it upon themselves to watch over its execution; nor will any suppose that particular States or cases would be exempted from its operation under the influence of partiality or favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6324"/>If, therefore, we can prove the blockade to have been ineffectual, we perhaps have a right to expect that the nations assenting to this declaration of the <name>Conference</name> at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> will not consider it to be binding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6325"/>We are fortified in this expectation not only by their own declaration, but by the nature of the interests affected by the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6326"/>So far at least it has been proved that the only certain and sufficient source of cotton supply has been found in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6327"/>It is probable that there are more people without than within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> who derive their means of living from the various uses which are made of this important staple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6328"/>A war, therefore, which shuts up this great source of supply from the general uses of mankind is directed as much against those who transport and manufacture cotton as against those who produce the raw material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6329"/>Innocent parties who are thus affected may well insist that a right whose exercise operates so unfavorably on them shall only be used within the strictest limits of public law. Would it not be a movement more in consonance with the spirit of the age to insist that amongst the many efficient means of waging war, this <num value="1">one</num> should be excepted in deference to the general interests of mankind, so many of whom depend for their means of living upon a ready and easy access to the greatest and cheapest cotton market of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6330"/>If, for the general benefit of commerce, some of its great routes have been neutralized so as to be unaffected by the chances of war, might not another interest of a greater and more world-wide importance claim at least so much consideration as to demand the benefit of every presumption in favor of its protection against all the chances of war, save those which arise under the strictest rules of public law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6331"/>This is a question of almost as much interest to the world at large as it is to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6332"/>No belligerent can claim the right thus to injure innocent parties by such a blockade, except to the extent that it can be shown to furnish the legitimate, or, perhaps, <pb id="p.465" n="465"/> we might go still further and say the necessary, means to prosecute the war successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6333"/>If it has become obvious, as would now seem to be the case, that no blockade which they can maintain will enable the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to subdue the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>, upon what plea can its further continuance be justified to <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> parties who are so deeply interested in a ready and easy access to the cheapest and most abundant sources of cotton supply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6334"/>In presenting the various views contained in this letter of instructions, you will say that they are offered as much in the general interests of humanity as in our own. We do not ask for assistance to enable us to maintain our independence against any power which has yet assailed us. <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> believes that he cannot be mistaken in supposing it to be the duty of the nations of the earth, by a prompt recognition, to throw the weight of their moral influence against the unnecessary prolongation of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6335"/>Whether the case now presented be <num value="1">one</num> for such action, he is, perhaps, not the most impartial judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6336"/>He has acquitted himself of his duty to other nations when he has presented to their knowledge the facts, to which their only sure access is through himself, in such a manner as will enable them to acquit themselves of their responsibilities to the world, according to their own sense of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6337"/>But whilst he neither feels nor affects an indifference to the decision of the world upon these questions which deeply concern the interests of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, he does not present their claim to a recognized place amongst the nations of the earth from the belief that any such recognition is necessary to enable them to achieve and secure their independence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6338"/>Such an act might diminish the sufferings and shorten the duration of an unnecessary war, but with or without it he believes that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, under the guidance of a kind and overruling <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, will make good their title to freedom and independence, and to a recognized place amongst the nations of the earth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6339"/>When you are officially recognized by the <rs>French Government</rs>, and diplomatic relations between the <num value="2">two</num> countries are thus fully established, you will request an audience of His Imperial Majesty for the purpose of presenting your letters accrediting you as Envoy Extraordinary and <rs type="role" reg="Minister Plenipotentiary">Minister Plenipotentiary</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, near His Imperial Majesty, and in that capacity you are empowered to negotiate such treaties as the mutual interests of both <pb id="p.466" n="466"/> countries may require, subject, of course, to the approval of the <rs>President</rs> and the co-ordinate branch of the treaty making power.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6376"/>Later on we knew they found only a few charred ruins of what was once a well-known mansion of almost palatial size and splendor in the <name>Longtown</name> neighborhood of Fairfield District.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6377"/>That afternoon we <num value="3">three</num> girls walked down to the creek's edge and formally buried our silver cups, some jewelry and a watch or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6378"/>It was a difficult ceremony, and would have even been solemn and impressive, but for the fact that we had scarcely got out of sight before <num value="1">one</num> suggested that we might forget the precise site of the interment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6379"/>Forthwith we returned, pushed aside the old stump (left as a monument) and, gathering our few but inestimately precious chattels, went back to the house to devise some more original, and, therefore, safer method of preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6380"/>None suggested itself, however, and we were reduced to the old, yet apparently reliable strategem of hiding them about our persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6381"/>Packages of cherished letters, pictures and lace were sewed in the hems of skirts, and I fashioned what seemed a very <q direct="unspecified">Maid of <placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName></q> arrangement, by which the wide folds of a dress concealed an Italian stiletto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6382"/>This exquisite little weapon had belonged to my father when a medical student with <persName n="Dickson,Doctor,,,," id="n0270.0035.00468.04636" reg="mostcommon:Dickson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Dickson</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and had attached to it a strap of chamois leather with a very suggestive button-hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6383"/>I used to look at the mother-of-pearl handle, the fine steel, <num value="2">two</num>-edged blade embossed with military emblems, and <hi rend="italics">very</hi> sharp, and then at this button-hole, and wonder <q direct="unspecified">What for?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6384"/>During the war, and especially towards the end, this question had come to haunt me. I wondered if it <hi rend="italics">could</hi> do anything, and I lived to prove it&mdash;almost!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6385"/>For several days I wore my dagger, and then losing interest in the tragic accoutrement, as the danger seemed delayed, I laid it on the dressing-table with watch, jewelry, etc. Thus <num value="1">one</num> may sleep on the very crest of <placeName reg="Vesuvius, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2114743">Vesuvius</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6386"/>A few days after, about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the afternoon, I was sitting quietly in my room reading; there came a tap at the door, and a girlish face appeared.</p>

<p>Going to the window, I looked out and saw <num value="0.5">a half</num>-dozen horses fastened to the palings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6393"/>I believe this was invariably the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6394"/>At least I never heard of their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approach ever being made by the front door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6395"/>Is there a phsychological reason for this?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6396"/>I had always determined to appear in my best dress before these guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6397"/>Southern women knew why. It was desirable to preserve <num value="1">one</num>, and naturally that <num value="1">one</num> would be the choicest when choice was so limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6398"/>But I found that the notification was too brief, and was obliged to content myself with putting on my cuffs (to save the buttons) cramming watch, ear-rings, broaches into my capacious pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6399"/>We had reached the door in our downward career, when I remembered the <hi rend="italics">role</hi> of the <q direct="unspecified">Maid of <placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName>,</q> which I had actually forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6400"/>Smiling sardonically to myself, I bade V. wait a moment, and returned, found the dagger under a lot of feminine small-wear and thrust it into the receptacle where the other valuables were reposing, not having on the dress arranged for it, and very deliberately we <num value="2">two</num> advanced to the charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6401"/>At the foot of the stairs a man was standing, as if uncertain where to proceed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6410"/></p> 
<p>A gun lay near, a sort of folding affair, it seemed to me, as it was bent double.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6411"/>I drew my skirts away as I passed it going to the rear of the house.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6412"/><q direct="unspecified">Oh! you needn't mind that,</q> he cried, much amused; <q direct="unspecified">it won't hurt anything now. It's broke.</q>

<p>But my exhortations were useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6421"/>She continued to moan and wring her hands and weep as if over the grave of her best-beloved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6422"/>Her mother-in-law, an elderly lady&mdash;and an invalid&mdash;was lying in a small bed when the invaders arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6423"/>They had forced her to rise, suspecting some ruse to protect valuables in or under the bedding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6424"/>Then thrusting in their sabres they literally disembowelled the mattress and <rs n="feather bed" type="product">feather-bed</rs>, the <hi rend="italics">debris</hi> of which was now strewn far and wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6425"/>The poor old lady was deeply distressed at the indignity of their treatment, but she opened not her lips, and surveyed the ruins with <name>Roman</name> fortitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6426"/>I spoke a few encouraging words to her, gave a glance at the side-board with doors broken off their hinges, and empty decanters and a sugar bowl lying about; then hastened back to watch, and, if possible, prevent the work of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6427"/>V., still entirely self-possessed, remained, trying to quiet her distracted mother.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6428"/>Sounds of discordant music issued from the parlor, and thither I went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6429"/><num value="1">One</num> of the blue-coats was seated at the piano, strumming away quite complaisantly, while another, in some seeming embarrassment at my sudden appearance, dropped a plated <rs n="water pitcher" type="product">water-pitcher</rs> which had attracted his artist eye. At this moment my little sister rushed up from some unexpected quarter, crying wildly: <q direct="unspecified">Oh, where is mamma's picture?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6430"/>They will get mamma's picture?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6431"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Hush!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6432"/>I whispered, grasping her arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6434"/></p> 
<p>But she would <hi rend="italics">not</hi> hush, and was not to be intimidated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6435"/><q direct="unspecified">Horrid old things!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6436"/>She went on crying angrily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6439"/>Oh, where is mamma's picture?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6440"/></p> 
<p>The silver connoisseur, relieved by the diversion, made a hasty exit from the parlor, and dashed by me up-stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6441"/>My heart was with my <persName n="Lares,,,,," id="n0270.0035.00470.04640" reg="mostcommon:Lares,nomatch:0"><surname>Lares</surname></persName> and <persName n="Penates,,,,," id="n0270.0035.00470.04641" reg="mostcommon:Penates,nomatch:0"><surname>Penates</surname></persName> (<num value="2">two</num> trunks!) and I as hastily followed, M. at my heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6442"/>When or why she turned back I never could exactly discover, nor did I miss her for some minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6443"/>She was still in pursuit, however, of <q direct="unspecified">mamma's picture,</q> which she now recollected had been given, with others, into the safekeeping of <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Pony</foreName></persName>, the household factotum and V.'s former nurse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6444"/>The investigating Federal proceeded to open drawers and wardrobes upon reaching my room; and, after watching him a few moments, I asked quietly what he wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6445"/>(I had heard that these conscientious creatures never stole anything right under <num value="1">one</num>'s nose!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6446"/>Hence my persistent presence.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6447"/><q direct="unspecified">We have come to look for arms,</q> was his somewhat sullen reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6448"/><pb id="p.471" n="471"/> Then in a tone of abrupt harshness, he added, <q direct="unspecified">Open these trunks!</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6450"/>I felt the better policy was to obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6451"/>So, taking out my keys, and drawing up a chair, I deliberately sat down, unlocked the trunk, and began taking out <num value="1">one</num> little dainty after another, shaking each carefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6452"/><q direct="unspecified">You can perceive,</q> I said, inviting scrutiny of each bit of ribbon and lace, <q direct="unspecified">that there is no mounted cavalryman or loaded cannon in here.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6453"/></p> 
<p>He turned off with a horrid oath, and drawing an immense navy revolver from his boot&mdash;there was <num value="1">one</num> in each Hessian-top&mdash;he presented it to my head.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6454"/><q direct="unspecified">Be in a hurry!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6455"/>was his order, evidently warming to his work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6456"/>I was just excited enough to be utterly reckless of consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6457"/><q direct="unspecified">I am not used to such commands,</q> I said, and therewith folded my hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6458"/>He advanced to the other trunk, and was about to break it open when I left off my dignity and came forward with the keys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6459"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object that met his eye&mdash;well trained in such service&mdash;was a tiny morocco purse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6460"/><q direct="unspecified">Ha! what's that?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6461"/></p> 
<p>I took it up and unclasped it tenderly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6462"/>There lay <num value="1">one</num> poor little silver sixpence, my only remaining bit of specie, which I had kept <q direct="unspecified">for luck.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6463"/>There also nestled a miniature Confederate flag that had been wont to adorn my toilette as a breast-knot in happier days, and was endeared by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> sweet memories.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6464"/><q direct="unspecified">This is all the money I have in the world,</q> I said, holding up the sixpence, <q direct="unspecified">but you can have it if you wish.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6465"/></p> 
<p>He threw it aside with an impatient gesture and another oath and walked off. Before I was aware of his intention, he had locked the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6466"/>I rose and walked toward it. <q direct="unspecified">Come,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">and I will show you the trunks in the other room, as there is nothing here, you see, in the way of arms.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6467"/></p> 
<p>But he had stationed himself in front of the door, his back toward it. For a moment, nay, a long minute&mdash;centuries it seemed to me&mdash;we stood thus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6468"/>There he was, a stalwart blonde of perhaps <num value="23">twenty-three</num> or <num value="4">four</num>, over <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> in height; his breath hot with the <rs n="peach brandy" type="product">peach brandy</rs> they had unearthed on this raid; his eyes blood-shot, a reckless demon looking out of their grey-green depths, ready for any atrocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6469"/>I measured him from cap to boots, then fixed my eyes steadily on his, not fearful in the least, calm to petrifaction almost, only as I pressed my left hand against my side I felt there a strange, wild fluttering, as of an imprisoned bird.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6470"/>With the other I slowly <pb id="p.472" n="472"/> and stealthily unloosed the stiletto from its sheath, for it stuck tightly in the silver scabbard, and still gazed at him with unflinching nerves and tense muscles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6471"/>Whether he saw and divined the movement, or whether he heard his companions galloping away, I know not; or if, indeed, any <q direct="unspecified">means</q> were necessary in this wonderful intervention of a protecting <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>; I only spoke these words very low, and my own voice was strange to me in its vibrating intensity: <q direct="unspecified">What do you mean, sir?

<p><num value="1">One</num> moment more his eye retained its fiendish brightness, then drooped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6481"/>A brief season of grace was left us to collect our scattered senses and pacify, if possible, the still distracted wife and mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6557"/>The school may then be said to have reached the highest point in the history of her prosperity, and everything seemed to foreshadow a bright future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6862"/>We who had now been in service nearly <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> were looked upon as veterans by the new regiments just called out. We were in a condition to enjoy the fun made by the mistakes and awkwardness of the fresh troops just from the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6863"/>The officers were very zealous and the men vied with each other in learning and properly discharging all of the duties of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6864"/>The sentinels of <num value="1">one</num> of these new regiments were <num value="1">one</num> night posted on the beach inside of high water mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6865"/>It was very natural that an up-countryman should not make proper allowances for the rise and fall of the tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6866"/>A sentinel of this regiment was instructed not to allow any person to pass without the countersign, and was particularly instructed not to leave his post on any consideration whatever till regularly relieved or withdrawn by a duly authorized officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6867"/>Before the relief guard came the tide had risen and the sentinel was waist-deep in water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6868"/>Upon the approach of the officer with the relief the sentinel went through with his part of the formula in a manner that would have done credit to <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s <orgName n="Old Guard" type="newspaper">Old Guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6874"/></p> 
<p>The officer seeing that he had <q direct="unspecified">a strict constructionist</q> to deal with, thought it best to comply with the sentinel's orders, and plunged into the surf regardless of damage to his shining uniform, and gave the countersign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6875"/>The sentinel was then marched out and relieved in true military style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6876"/>It is likely that the next time this officer posted a sentinel on the beach, he instructed him that old <persName n="Neptune,,,,," id="n0270.0037.00494.04770" reg="mostcommon:Neptune,nomatch:0"><surname>Neptune</surname></persName>, as well as a properly accredited <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName>, might require a change of his beat.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6896"/><rs type="role2">Major</rs>,&mdash;I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this brigade since I have been commanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6897"/>On the night of the <dateStruct value="-06-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, <persName n="Bryan,General,,,," id="n0270.0038.00496.04775" reg="mostcommon:Bryan,K.,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bryan</surname></persName> turned over the command of the brigade to myself, while occupying a position on the line at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6898"/>Immediately after he left I received orders to destroy the works which we occupied and withdraw before daylight, the line having been changed previously and works thrown up in rear of us by General <orgName n="Law's Brigade"><persName n="Law,Brigade,,,," id="n0270.0038.00496.04776" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigade"></roleName><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6899"/>Accordingly, at the time specified, the brigade was withdrawn and moved in rear of General Law's position for the purpose of allowing the men to rest, they being very much fatigued by the arduous labors of several days previous to that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6900"/>About the time that the men had stacked arms preparatory to rest, an attack was made upon <placeName reg="General Law's line">General Law's line</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6901"/>He sent a courier to me asking that I would move up to his assistance, as his works had not been well supplied with ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6902"/>The brigade was put under arms immediately, and moved up to <placeName reg="General Law's line">General Law's line</placeName> through a heavy fire of musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6903"/>The men moved up in gallant style, and very soon the enemy were forced to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6904"/>The brigade lost several men and officers killed and wounded, amongst whom was <persName n="McClendon,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0038.00496.04777" reg="mostcommon:McClendon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>McClendon</surname></persName>, acting Aid de-Camp, while nobly discharging his duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6905"/>On the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="2">4th</day></dateStruct> we were ordered to take position on the line again, to the right of the position occupied by General Law, which position <pb id="p.497" n="497"/> was occupied by the brigade for several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6906"/>Here our line was in such close proximity to the enemy's works that a constant fire was kept up during the day between us and the enemy, resulting in loss to us, and to be supposed in greater loss to them, as we finally almost silenced their sharpshooters entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6907"/>During the night of the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> the enemy abandoned their works in our front, and on the morning of the <num value="14" type="ordinal">14th</num> we moved from there to <placeName reg="Frazier's Farm">Frazier's Farm</placeName>, at which place we remained until the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num>, when we moved in the direction of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, reaching there on the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="2">18th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6908"/>Very soon after our arrival we were ordered upon line, and before the troops could be arranged upon the line the enemy made an attack, which was very easily repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6909"/>The brigade occupied this line until the <num value="23" type="ordinal">23d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6910"/>The enemy had thrown up works within <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure> of ours, and when we were placed there the works were incomplete, and we were compelled to complete them under the incessant fire of musketry and artillery, and on some parts of the line the works were begun without any protection whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6911"/>The number of casualties occurring in the brigade at this place will give some idea of the difficulties which had to be contended against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6912"/>There were <measure n="15" type="killed">fifteen killed</measure> and <measure n="31" type="wounded">thirty-one wounded</measure>, most of which proved fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6913"/>When relieved from this line the brigade was held in reserve about <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile in rear of the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6914"/>Here we remained until the <dateStruct value="-07-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, during which time nothing occurred worthy of special notice, except an occasional march down the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName> in quest of the enemy, but failing to find him, we returned to our same place of bivouac each time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6915"/>On the morning of the <num value="23" type="ordinal">23d</num> received orders to move, and set out for the north side of the <rs>James</rs>; on the <num value="26" type="ordinal">26th</num> took position upon the <placeName reg="New Market, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7016287">New Market</placeName> road and fortified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6916"/>The enemy, ascertaining that a force was at that point, crossed over a heavy force and made disposition of their forces in order to attack, and did attack the troops on our left, when the <rs>General Commanding</rs> thought it prudent to withdraw, and accordingly orders were given to fall back to <placeName reg="Russell's Mill">Russell's Mill</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,2275605" n="1.000 10" reg="Darbytown, Wayne, Pennsylvania">Darbytown</placeName> road prolongation of the line at <placeName reg="New Market Heights">New Market Heights</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6917"/>The enemy advanced, but the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> disposed of the troops in such a manner as to extend the line to such an extent, and make them believe that we had so great a force, as to deter him from an attack, and thus he delayed the enemy until reinforcements came to our aid. At this place the enemy advanced their skirmishers, and I was ordered to send out <num value="2">two</num> regiments to drive them back.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6919"/>On the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="2">29th</day></dateStruct> the enemy withdrew from our front, and recrossed the river to the south side, and went into camp near <placeName reg="Chester, Hampden, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049593">Chester Station</placeName>, on the <rs type="place">Telegraph Road</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6920"/>Here <persName n="Bryan,General,,,," id="n0270.0038.00498.04779" reg="mostcommon:Bryan,K.,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bryan</surname></persName> returned and resumed command about the <dateStruct value="-08-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, and remained with the brigade until the morning of the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct>, when he again left, during which time we moved from <placeName reg="Chester, Hampden, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049593">Chester Station</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>&mdash;nothing of importance having occurred during the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6921"/>When I took command again on the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="2">21st</day></dateStruct>, the brigade was near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and with orders to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6922"/>The division was moved in the direction of <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>, with this brigade in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6923"/>After moving some <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure>, we encountered the cavalry of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6924"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> ordered me to send forward <num value="2">two</num> regiments to attack, which was done, driving the enemy a short distance, when it was found necessary to reinforce with another regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6925"/>I suppose we met about <num value="1">one</num> brigade of the enemy's cavalry, driving them about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>, when they fell back upon a division of their cavalry, strongly posted and with artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6926"/>Here I halted the brigade, thinking it not prudent to advance further, when the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> brought up the remainder of the division, and ordered an advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6927"/>By this time the enemy had retreated hastily in the direction of <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6928"/>In this affair we lost a few men wounded, and <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2" type="killed">two killed</measure>. After this, we moved on to <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>, the enemy falling back to <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harpers Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6929"/>We remained at <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName> a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6930"/>The skirmish line was engaged slightly near <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--30"><day reg="2">30th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6931"/>On the <dateStruct value="--31"><day reg="2">31st</day></dateStruct> the brigade, with others of the division, moved back in the direction of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6932"/>On <dateStruct value="-09-3"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="3">3d</day></dateStruct> we left <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> and moved towards <placeName reg="Berryville, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2110642">Berryville</placeName>, arriving near <placeName reg="Berryville, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2110642">Berryville</placeName> a little before sunset in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6933"/>The enemy being immediately in our front, line of battle was formed by order of the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>, in conjunction with the other brigades of the division, and an attack made upon their lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6934"/>Our men moved forward with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name> and gallantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6935"/>The enemy only held their position long enough to fire <num value="1">one</num> round, then fled precipitately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6936"/>By this time night interposed, and we slept upon the field, and next morning found that their line, which had crossed the road, now ran parallel to it, and they had made use of the time allowed by night to fortify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6937"/>We remained in line confronting them next day and night, and were then ordered to withdraw, and return to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6938"/><pb id="p.499" n="499"/></p> 
<p>The loss of the brigade in this battle was <measure n="4" type="killed">four killed</measure> and <measure n="26" type="wounded">twenty-six wounded</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6939"/>On the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="2">19th</day></dateStruct>, the <rs>General</rs> having received information that a raiding party was in the vicinity, and that they were going towards <placeName key="tgn,2114382" n="1.000 36" reg="stevensburg, culpeper, virginia">Stevensburg</placeName>, ordered me with this brigade to a certain point on that road to intercept them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6940"/>The brigade was put in motion immediately, and moved at double-quick for nearly <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, but upon arriving within about <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure>, the enemy were opposite to us in the road, having proceeded so far as to render it impossible to cut them off. Finding that this was the only opportunity we would have of inflicting damage upon them, I gave orders to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6941"/>We killed and wounded several of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6942"/>Our loss was nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6943"/>We recaptured from this party quite a number of horses and mules, which they had captured from a Government lot near <placeName reg="Rapid Ann Station">Rapid Ann Station</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6944"/>On the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="2">20th</day></dateStruct> we left <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, marching in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, which place we reached on the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="2">25th</day></dateStruct>; camped there <num value="1">one</num> night, and then again we moved in the direction of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, passing through <placeName reg="Swift Run Gap">Swift Run Gap</placeName>, thence up by the foot of the mountains in the direction of <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6945"/>On the&mdash;&mdash;of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> we came in sight of <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>, at which place the enemy's cavalry was distinctly visible, driving ours before them across the river and through the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6946"/>By an order from the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> I placed my brigade in the edge of a wood, near by the road leading from the town, in such a manner as not to be observed by the enemy, and awaited their advance in that direction, our cavalry having already retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6947"/>As he had anticipated, it was not long before they came dashing down the road moving by the flank, but by the untimely firing of some shots from the command we failed to inflict such loss upon them as otherwise would have been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6954"/>Here a halt was ordered until near <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>, when I was ordered to move down this road until the brigade had crossed over, and then turn down the creek and form line of battle parallel to the creek, and to advance immediately to the front until a certain clump of woods was passed, and then to change direction to the left in such manner as to cause the line to confront that of the enemy; to drive the enemy's pickets in without firing upon them; and not to fire until the enemy's line was reached; all of which was strictly complied with, the gallant men moving forward steadily and firmly, receiving the shots from the enemy's picket line without replying, but continuing to move forward with unbroken front, through the volleys of musketry and cannon which they were now exposed to, until they reached the enemy's works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6955"/>The enemy made a stubborn resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7129"/>The condition of the road rendered sleep impossible, and probably it was years before the footprints of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0270.0039.00509.04803" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:3"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> were obliterated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7130"/>Every available path was cut up by the wheels of heavy ordnance and wagon-trains; <pb id="p.510" n="510"/> and even at this favorable season of the year the hoof-marks of cavalry were plainly visible in the sun-baked mud over each side of the main track.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7131"/>But this was not the only enemy to repose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7132"/>Rumors of highwaymen were rife, and only a night or <num value="2">two</num> previous the stage had been intercepted, the driver intimidated, and the mails and passengers robbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7133"/>As we jolted along over clay ca&ntilde;ons and through dense woodlands, we saw a modern Robin Hood in every passing shadow, and heard with fluttering heart a signal in the idle whistle of every laggard freedman.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7134"/>About midnight the coach stopped at a wayside shanty for a change of horses and supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7135"/>Provided with a lunch I did not get out with the other passengers, but shared my frugal meal with the <name>Baltimorean</name>, a middle-aged gentleman of refinement and widely travelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7136"/>As we sat there discussing our chicken and sandwiches in the fitful glare of a lightwood fire blazing in front of the temporary hostelrie, a trio of rough-looking men, carrying guns, came out of the forest and approached us. <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> F. glanced at them, and then put his hand behind him with a significant gesture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7139"/>Finding these, doubtless, unworthy of their steel, or unsuggestive of concealed gold, the mysterious foot-pads vanished as they came, silently and stealthily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7140"/>Perhaps they were merely harmless hunters, for in those days many lived almost solely on the results of the chase; but their proceedings were certainly suspicious, and Mr. F. maintained that their object was plunder.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7158"/>I must pass over that meeting with dear ones in the desolated home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7169"/>She saw the signal-rockets go up which announced the inauguration of a night of license and diabolic orgies unparalleled in the annals of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7170"/>She heard the wild shouts of frenzied bacchanals mingled with the shrieks of women and children surrounded by a belt of fire, and yet freezing under the pall of a wintry sky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7172"/>As she still sat there listening to the far-away sounds of tumult, roaring flames and hurrahs and screams, there came a sudden crash in the direction of the dining-room, which opened upon a long piazza fronting a side street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7173"/>She knew what it meant, and hastened thither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7174"/>The windows had been burst through, though the doors were unfastened, and a horde of what scarcely seemed human creatures came pouring in, each with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> lighted candles in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7186"/>Some had already begun the work of pillage and burning, and while the terrified servants stood in the doorway with starting eyes, beseeching their beloved mistress to come away from the scene of destruction, she stood fearless and unmoved in the midst of starting flame and blasphemous plunder.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7255"/>It was now necessary to make the final arrangements for the assault on the city which was to be made that night at about <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7662"/>Of course it was impossible for us to learn the contents of the papers, without making a light to read them by, or waiting till the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7663"/>We did the latter; and, as soon as day broke, the papers were read, and found to contain <hi rend="italics">every line and every word</hi> as afterwards copied into the <rs>Richmond</rs> newspapers <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n0270.0040.00548.05140" reg="nearbymention:Dahlgren,Ulric,,,"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>'s name was signed to <num value="1">one</num> or more of the papers, and also written on the inside of the front cover of his memorandum-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7664"/>Here the date of purchase, I suppose, was added.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7665"/>The book had been written with a degree of haste clearly indicated by the frequent interlineations and corrections, but the orders referred to had also been re-written on a separate sheet of paper; and, as thus copied, were published to the <pb id="p.549" n="549"/> world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7666"/>Some of the papers were found loose in <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n0270.0040.00549.05141" reg="nearbymention:Dahlgren,Ulric,,,"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>'s pockets, others were between the leaves of the memorandum-book.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7667"/>The papers thus brought to light were preserved by myself in the continual presence of witnesses of unquestionable veracity, until about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the afternoon of the day after their capture; at which time myself and party met <persName n="Pollard,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0040.00549.05142" reg="nearbymention:Pollard,James,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName>, who, up to this time, knew nothing in the world of the existence of the <rs>Dahlgren Papers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7668"/>At his request, I let him read the papers; after doing which he requested me to let him carry them to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 13" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7669"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I refused, for I thought that I knew what to do with them quite as well as any <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7670"/>But I was finally induced by my friends, against my will, to surrender the papers to <persName n="Pollard,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0040.00549.05143" reg="nearbymention:Pollard,James,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName>, mainly in consideration of the fact that they would reach <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 13" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> much sooner through him than through a semi-weekly mail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7671"/>The papers which were thus handed over to the <rs>Confederate Government</rs>&mdash;I state it <hi rend="italics">again &mdash; were correctly copied by the <rs>Richmond</rs> newspapers</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7672"/>A <num value="1001">thousand and one</num> falsehoods have been told about this affair&mdash; by our own men as well as by the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7673"/>Some of our own men were actuated by motives of selfishness and ambition to claim, each <num value="1">one</num> for himself, the whole credit of the affair; when, in fact, the credit belongs to no particular individual, but collectively, to the whole of our party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7674"/>We were a strange medley of regulars, raw troops, old farmers, preachers, schoolboys, etc. But I believe that all present did their duty, only to find that all the credit was afterwards claimed, with a considerable degree of success among the ignorant, by those who were not present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7676"/>In making this statement, I am actuated only by a desire to do justice to the memory of <num value="1">one</num> who was too unassuming to sound his own trumpet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7677"/>I am also told, by soldiers, that <persName n="Pollard,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0040.00549.05145" reg="nearbymention:Pollard,James,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName> deserves a considerable degree of credit for the part he played in following and harassing the enemy up to the time they took the right fork of the road near <placeName reg="Harwood, Anne Arundel, Maryland" key="tgn,2047408">Butler's Tavern</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7678"/>You are, of course, aware of the fact that the enemy has always denied the authenticity of the <rs>Dahlgren Papers</rs>, and declared them to <hi rend="italics">be forgeries</hi>. To prove the utter absurdity and falsehood of such a charge, I submit the following:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7679"/><num value="1">1</num>. The papers were taken by <persName n="Littlepage,,,,," id="n0270.0040.00549.05146" reg="nearbymention:Littlepage,William,,,"><surname>Littlepage</surname></persName> from the person of a man whose name he had never heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7680"/>It was a dark night, and the <pb id="p.550" n="550"/> captor, with the aid of the noon-day sun, could not write at all. I afterwards taught him to write a little in my school.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7681"/>The question occurs: Can a boy who cannot write at all, write such papers, and sign to them an unknown name?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7682"/>If they had been forged by any <num value="1">one</num> else, would they have been placed in the hands of a child?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7683"/>Could any <num value="1">one</num> else have forged an unknown and unheard of name?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7684"/><num value="2">2</num>. The papers were handed to me immediately after their capture, in the presence of gentlemen of undoubted integrity and veracity, before whom I can prove that the papers not only were not, but could not have been, altered or interpolated by myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7685"/>These gentlemen were with me every moment of the time between my receiving the papers and my delivering them to <persName n="Pollard,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0270.0040.00550.05147" reg="nearbymention:Pollard,James,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7687"/>But all agree that they were correctly copied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7688"/>In short, human testimony cannot establish any fact more fully than the fact that <persName n="Dahlgren,Colonel,Ulric,,," id="n0270.0040.00550.05149" reg="default:Dahlgren,Ulric,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Ulric</foreName> <surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> was the author of the <quote><persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n0270.0040.00550.05150" reg="nearbymention:Dahlgren,Ulric,,,"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> papers.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7689"/>With regard to the part taken by myself in this affair, I lay no claim to any credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7690"/>I do not write this version of the affair to gain notoriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7691"/>I have made it a rule not to mention my own name, except in cases where I found that false impressions were being made upon the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7692"/>You know very well that my being <persName n="Littlepage,,,,," id="n0270.0040.00550.05151" reg="nearbymention:Littlepage,William,,,"><surname>Littlepage</surname></persName>'s captain entitled me to claim the capture of the papers for <hi rend="italics">myself</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7695"/>I replied, for myself, that I was nothing more than the humble captain of a company of schoolboys, and that if I deserved any credit, it was only so much as he might choose to give me for preserving the papers, when advised to destroy them, to avoid being captured with them in my possession, which, I was told, would result in the hanging of our little party.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7696"/>I have never given the information herein contained before, because I had hoped that it would be given to the public by others, and I give it now, because I regard it as a duty to do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7975"/>Genial and full of fun, laughing, singing, and playing practical jokes on all comers, he was at the same time stern in his discipline, ceaseless in his vigils, almost incapable of fatigue, and utterly regardless of danger when there was stern work to be done He has been appropriately called <q direct="unspecified">a splendid war machine,</q> and he was the admiration not only of the cavalry, but of the whole army of which he was so conspicuous a leader, and whose splendid achievements he did so much to produce.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7978"/>For a large part of the time of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0270.0043.00574.05434" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s brilliant war career he was his chief of staff and confidential friend, and had every opportunity of personal knowledge of most of the events he describes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7979"/>Still he has conscientiously and laboriously studied the official reports on both sides&mdash;corresponded with officers in position to know particular events&mdash;and has also made diligent use of private papers which <persName n="Stuart,Mrs.,,,," id="n0270.0043.00574.05435" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> placed at his disposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7980"/>In a word he was thoroughly equipped for his task, his literary qualifications were of high order, and he has written a book which is clear, chaste, and every way admirable in its style, and is at the same time a real contribution to the history of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7981"/>With the loving hand of a devoted friend <persName n="McClellan,Major,,,," id="n0270.0043.00574.05436" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> defends <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0270.0043.00574.05437" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> from adverse criticism, or describes his able strategy and his brilliant exploits; but he writes in the calm spirit of the historian rather than with the blind zeal of the partisan, and has made <num value="1">one</num> of the <hi rend="italics">fairest</hi> books we have ever seen.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7982"/>If we were to make an adverse criticism it would be that, in his laudable aim to bring out clearly <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0270.0043.00574.05438" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s splendid military career, <persName n="McClellan,Major,,,," id="n0270.0043.00574.05439" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has not introduced many anecdotes, reminiscences, and private letters which would add to the interest of the book for the popular reader, and bring out more clearly <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0270.0043.00574.05440" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s stainless private character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7983"/>And yet, while avoiding meretricious ornaments of style, there are some passages of rare beauty and touching pathos, and the whole book is <num value="1">one</num> which an old Confederate at least cannot but read with sustained interest, and kindling enthusiasm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7984"/>We deeply regret that the book comes to us too late for the full review which, under other circumstances, we should have delighted to give it, and that our printers warn us that even this hurried notice must close.</p>
