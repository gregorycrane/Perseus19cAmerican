<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The pages of this volume tell little of war's pomp and pageantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Their subject is, and must be, grim and terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Though prisoners of war were not criminals, but often men whose courage was their only fault, and though their detention must not be considered as deserved punishment, but as a military necessity, nevertheless all prisons are unlovely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The groans of men, <num value="1">one</num> moment vigorous, the next shattered and broken, or the sight of strength visibly ebbing away from disease, are awful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is the dark and cruel side of war that must here be told.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The reader who finds nothing more than this is, however, careless and superficial, seeing only the object immediately before his eyes, and neglecting relations and perspective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><num value="1">One</num> may hold a dime so that it shuts out the sun. A fact out of its relations to other facts is no better than a lie. Just so far as history enables us to see any particular epoch in its relation to those before, and as the portent of those coming after, to that extent history is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The failure of the sentimentalist and the social reformer often grows out of myopia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They see only what is near their eyes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>That men must be judged by the standard of their times is a platitude, but it is well to emphasize platitudes, for the obvious is often forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We are prone to judge the past by the standards of the present, and some of our standards are rising.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Unpleasant as is the story of the prisons of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, however great their shortcomings, the treatment of prisoners, taken as a whole, marks a decided advance over the general practice of the world before that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Instances of theatrical generosity have always been plentiful, but never before had the dictates of humanity so profoundly influenced the action of so many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>We must believe that the greatest horrors&mdash;for there were horrors&mdash; arose from ignorance or apparent necessity, rather than from intention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>During our own Revolution, the treatment of prisoners is a subject upon which both we and the <rs>English</rs> must prefer not to dwell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Less than <num value="3">three</num> score years separated the <rs>Civil War</rs> from the <rs>War</rs> of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> and from the <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> <note anchored="yes" place="inset">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Never in history were money and effort so lavishly expended upon the cure of disease and the care of the wounded as during the <rs>Civil War</rs>; and never before was effort so well rewarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A few years before, great captains had repudiated any obligations to their sick or wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>These were no more than the dead on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Only the man able to carry a musket, a lance, or a saber had their attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>That effort was misdirected during our great contest is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Only supernatural wisdom and more than mortal strength could have brought the surgeon, the sufferer, and the relief together at precisely the right moment on every occasion, but the effort to accomplish this impossible task was made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The echoes of the guns in the <name>Crimea</name> had hardly died away when the <rs>Civil War</rs> began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Yet during that terrible winter of <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">55</year></dateStruct> the mortality from sickness in the <rs>English</rs> camps, was so great that, had it continued, the whole <name>English</name> army would have been wiped out in less than a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Compare this record with that of the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States army</orgName> as told in the following pages and see what advance a few years had brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>While the medical records of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate Armies</orgName> do not exist, we know that in that service, also, extraordinary results were accomplished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The picture which introduces these paragraphs has a significance which cannot be over-emphasized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In the preparation of the prison sections, the author has consulted a large number of the published accounts of experiences, has talked with dozens of <num value="1">one</num>-time prisoners, and has corresponded with many more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The conflicting accounts have been checked by the contemporary documents contained in the <num value="8">eight</num> prison volumes of the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Records,,Official,,," id="n0112.0001.00016.00007" reg="default:Records,Official,,,"><foreName>Official</foreName> <surname>Records</surname></persName> of the <rs>Union</rs> and <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> <figure id="fig.017">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>They have helped him to keep his papers straight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The basket on the man's arm suggests the charitable nature of the enterprise, the women in the doorway and on the porch indicate the feminine interest in it, and the ecclesiastical garb of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the crowd suggests its religious nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>There they were maintained with army rations and some measure of official supervision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In this Camp an epidemic of smallpox broke out. The Camp was quarantined, but word came to the authorities that it was in bad shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The dead were not being buried, the sick were not being cared for, and the food was being appropriated by the stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>If a large number of men should simultaneously attempt to overcome the guards or throw themselves against the flimsy barriers which enclosed so many prisons, undoubtedly a large number would escape, but it was almost certain that the foremost would be wounded, if not killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>So only the most reckless or the most despairing usually attempted to break their confinement in this manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>Since the prisons were in many cases only enclosures surrounded by a fence or a stockade, and since the only tools easily procured were knives, pieces of tin, or <rs n="sheet iron" type="product">sheet iron</rs>, unequal to the task of cutting through stone or iron, but entirely adequate for removing earth, tunneling was the means of escape to which prisoners most often resorted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>Sometimes these tunnels were of great length, and the fact that they could be constructed in the short time given to them is astonishing, particularly when the simple tools are considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>The usual plan was to begin in some concealed spot, preferably under a bunk, sink a shaft <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> and then run out horizontally beyond the stockade or fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>Where an outer ring of sentinels was stationed at some distance from the fence, the attempt was always made to run the tunnel beyond them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>Seldom was the diameter of the tunnel greater than would accommodate <num value="1">one</num> person on all fours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>The loosened earth was either carried back by the operator, thrown into a well, a sewer, a sink, or a stove, or concealed in any <num value="1">one</num> of a dozen other ingenious ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>Sometimes <num value="2">two</num> cords were attached to a box or a haversack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>However, in comparison with the number who attempted to escape in this manner, few succeeded, as the odds against their success were too great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>Only a few could be entrusted with the secret of an attempt, as any considerable gathering of the prisoners in one particular place was almost sure to arouse the suspicion of the guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>Frequent inspections were made to discover these underground passages, and some of the guards became quite skilful in thwarting such plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>Then, too, in almost every prison there were spies in the guise of prisoners, who reported any suspicious circumstances to the authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>But if all these dangers were avoided, others remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>Since the prisoners had no means of discovering whether or not they were proceeding horizontally, passages often came to the surface too soon, as it seems to be a tendency of those burrowing underground to work upward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>Sometimes the passage of a team caused the roof to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>Attempts to escape in this manner were not always treated with severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>In some prisons the guards appear to have regarded it as a game, at which each side was trying to thwart the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>A prisoner at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> tells of starting a tunnel from the little hut which he occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>The tendency of the human mole is to bore upward; the tunnel came to the top too soon on the near side of the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>There is testimony of every conceivable sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>Southerners have stated that Federal prisoners were well treated and that they were badly treated, that the commandants of prisons were harsh and callous, and that they were kind and considerate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year, money was always taken from the prisoners on entering, as it was found that a guard was not always above temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>When a sutler was allowed in a prison, a prisoner with a balance to his credit was allowed to give orders on his account, or else he was furnished with checks good for purchases.

The Confederate wounded from the same battle were treated in private houses, in small, unoccupied wooden buildings, and small tobacco-factories improvised as hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>There were serious objections to this method of treatment of the sick and wounded, the principal being the liability of spreading contagious diseases among the inhabitants of the city; the aggregation of so many patients in the necessarily large wards of the factories, thereby contaminating the buildings, rendering them unfit for occupancy; and the impossibility of supplying by these means the further demands of the service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>To meet, as far as practicable, these requirements, the plan was adopted of erecting buildings, each <num value="1">one</num> to be a ward and separate, of undressed planks set upright, calculated for <num value="32">thirty-two</num> beds, with streets running each way, say <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>The plan proved to be excellent, and the temporary hospital buildings in the city were abandoned as soon as practicable, the larger factories only being retained and used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>This segregation of the sick and wounded was highly beneficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>If the condition of a ward, from whatever cause, required its abandonment, it was done without trouble or much cost to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>Congress had permitted no preparations for war to be made; supplies were neither on hand nor could they be obtained at short notice, and the number of trained medical officers was not sufficient to leaven promptly the mass of surgeons fresh from civil life, whose zeal, patriotism, and professional ability could not compensate for the profound ignorance of everything military which they necessarily entertained at the outset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>To each regiment of infantry or cavalry was assigned a surgeon and an assistant surgeon; to a battalion of either, and sometimes to a company of artillery, an assistant surgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>Whenever regiments and battalions were combined into brigades, the surgeon whose commission bore the oldest date became the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Surgeon">senior surgeon</rs> of brigade, and although a member of the staff of the brigade commander, was not relieved of his regimental duties; sometimes, however, he was allowed an additional assistant surgeon, who was carried as a supernumerary on the brigade roster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>To the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Surgeon">senior surgeon</rs> of brigade, the regimental and battalion medical officers made their daily morning, weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports, and reports of killed and wounded after engagements, which by him were consolidated and forwarded to the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Surgeon">chief surgeon</rs> of the division to which the brigade was attached; regiments and brigades acting in an independent capacity forwarded their reports to the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs> of the army or department, or to the surgeon-general direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>Requisitions for regimental and battalion medical, surgical, and hospital supplies, as well as applications for furlough or leave of absence, discharge, resignation, or assignment to post duty, on account of disability, were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approved by the regimental or battalion medical officer, after giving his reasons for approval and the nature of the disability in the latter instances, and forwarded by him to the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Surgeon">senior surgeon</rs> of brigade, and by him to the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Surgeon">chief surgeon</rs> of division and the other ranking officers in the corps and army for their approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>Independent commands reported to the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs> of the department or army, or the surgeon-general direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>Medical purveyors nearest to the army, as promptly as possible, forwarded all needed medical, surgical, and hospital supplies, on approved requisitions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>Assignments to the position of chief surgeon of division were sometimes made in accordance with seniority of rank of the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Surgeon">senior surgeons</rs> of brigades, in other instances on application of the general commanding the division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>His duties, in addition to approving reports coming from the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Surgeon">senior surgeons</rs> of brigades, were to advise with the division commander in all matters pertaining <pb id="p.350" n="350"/> to the medical care and hygiene of his command, and to have personal care of the attaches of the division staff and headquarters, and to advise and consult with his medical subordinates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>To each corps was assigned a medical director, a commissioned surgeon, his permanent assignment being made on personal application of the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">lieutenant-general</rs> commanding the corps; temporarily and when emergency demanded, his duties, which were similar to those of the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Surgeon">chief surgeon</rs> of division as pertaining to the corps, devolved upon the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Surgeon">chief surgeon</rs> of division whose commission bore priority of date; he, in turn, being succeeded by the ranking senior surgeon of brigade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>A <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs> was assigned to the staff of each general commanding a department, or an army in a department, his selection usually being in deference to the general on whose staff he served and to whom was submitted for approval all reports and papers, from the various <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, independent divisions, brigades, or smaller detachments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>He also had charge of the staff and attaches of the department or army headquarters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>The non-commissioned medical staff consisted of a hospital steward for each regiment or battalion, with the rank and emoluments of an orderly sergeant, his selection as a rule being made by the ranking medical officer of the command, usually a graduate or undergraduate in medicine, or <num value="1">one</num> having had previous experience in handling drugs; and his duties were to have charge of the medical, surgical, and hospital supplies under direction of the regimental or battalion medical officer, caring for and dispensing the same, seeing that the directions of his superior as to diet and medicines were carried out, or reporting their neglect or failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>The <orgName n="Regimental Band" type="band">regimental band</orgName> constituted the infirmary detail to aid in caring for the sick in Camp and to carry the wounded from the field of battle, and when so occupied were under the surgeon or assistant surgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>When necessary, additional detail was made from the enlisted men to serve temporarily or permanently on the infirmary corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>In some instances, an enlisted man was detailed as hospital clerk, and with the hospital steward was required to be present at sick-call each morning; these soldiers, with the infirmary detail, were relieved from all other regimental duty, such as guard duty and police detail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>The duties of the <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Surgeon">assistant surgeon</rs> were to assist or relieve the surgeon in caring for the sick and wounded in Camp or on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>On the field of battle he was expected to be close up in the immediate rear of the center of his regiment, accompanied by the infirmary detail, and to give primary attention, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> aid to the wounded&mdash;this consisting in temporary control of hemorrhage by ligature, tourniquet, or bandage and compress, adjusting and temporarily fixing fractured limbs, administering water, anodynes, or stimulants, if needed, and seeing that the wounded were promptly carried to the field-hospital in the rear by the infirmary detail or ambulance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>The duties of the surgeons, in addition to caring for the sick in Camp and on the march, were to establish a field-hospital, as soon as they could learn that the command to which they were attached was going under fire, at some convenient and, if possible, sheltered spot behind a hill or in a ravine, about <num value="0.5">one-half</num> to <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> in rear of the line of battle, which was done under direction of a brigade or division surgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>Here the combined medical staff of a brigade or division aided <num value="1">one</num> another in the performance of such operations as were deemed necessary, as the wounded were brought from the front by the infirmary detail on stretchers or in the ambulance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>Amputations, resections of bone, ligatures of arteries, removals of foreign bodies, adjusting and permanently fixing fractures, and all minor and major operations and dressings were made when deemed best for the comfort and welfare of the wounded men. As soon as possible after the permanent dressings were made at the field-hospital, and even in some instances while the troops were still engaged, the wounded were carried to the railroad and transported to the more permanent hospitals in the villages, towns, and cities, some miles distant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>The uniform worn by the medical corps was similar to that of the rank and file with only a slight difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>While the cloth and cut were the same, the facings of the coat collar and cuffs and the stripe down the sides of the trousers were black, while those of the infantry were light blue, the artillery, scarlet, and cavalry, buff; on the front of the cap or hat were the letters <q direct="unspecified">M.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>embroidered in gold, embraced in <num value="2">two</num> olive branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>On the coat sleeve of the <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Surgeon">assistant surgeon</rs> were <num value="2">two</num> rows of gold braid, with <num value="3">three</num> gold bars on the ends of the coat collar extending back about <measure n="1.5inches" type="distance">one and a half inches</measure>; while the surgeon had <num value="3">three</num> rows of braid on the coat sleeves, and a single star on each side of the coat collar about an inch and <num value="0.5">a half</num> from the end. The chevrons on the coat sleeves and the stripe down the trousers of the hospital steward were similar to those worn by an orderly or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sergeant, but were black in color.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>The statement is sometimes made that many Confederate surgeons were inefficient, and in <pb id="p.351" n="351"/> support of this contention a statement attributed to <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0112.0019.00351.01176" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, in <persName n="Craven,Surgeon,,,," id="n0112.0019.00351.01177" reg="mostcommon:Craven,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeon</roleName> <surname>Craven</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Prison Life of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0112.0019.00351.01178" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName></q> is produced, in which he is reported to have said in conversation with the author, that <q direct="unspecified">they had been obliged to accept as surgeons in the <rs>Southern</rs> army many lads who had only half finished their education in Northern colleges.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/></p> 
<p>This statement would seem to indicate a scarcity of capable medical men who were willing to serve as such in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, while the facts are that many of the infantry and cavalry battalions and regiments, as well as artillery companies, in addition to their usual complement of medical officers, bore on their rolls, either in field and staff, the commissioned officers of the line, or even in rank and file, capable and eminently well-qualified medical men, many of whom were subsequently transferred to the medical corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>The reports from Northern prisons where line officers or enlisted men often assisted the <rs>Federal</rs> surgeons in the care of the sick, confirm this statement.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>It can be said, in all sincerity and confidence in the statement, that the students of the <rs>South</rs> who graduated from Northern and Southern medical colleges prior to the war between the <name>States</name>, were superior in scholastic attainments and mental qualifications to those of subsequent years.
