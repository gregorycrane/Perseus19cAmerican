<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>During the previous weeks, the <orgName n="Engineer Corps" type="corps">engineer corps</orgName> of the army had been busy in performing various works which the wisdom and skill (conceded by the military world to be profound) of the chief of engineers had planned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/><num value="1">One</num> phase of this work was the trestlework bridges, rendered indispensable because the wings of our army were separated by the morass of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>We desire to briefly describe this triumph of military engineering, as an illustration of <num value="1">one</num> of the manifold phases of talent that were utilized by the government, in its struggle for existence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>The approach to the bridge on the north side from the foot of the hill, was of earth raised perhaps <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure>, deep lateral ditches being made, the last and upper stratum of earth being thrown upon a layer of brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>There were perhaps <num value="20">twenty</num> cribs built upon the swampy shore and into the stream, and, beyond these, <num value="6">six</num> framed trestles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>On the other side there were probably <num value="20">twenty</num> more cribs, or firm, compact log piers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Stringers extended from cribs to trestles, and from trestles to the cribs upon the other side of the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Upon these timbers, for the floor of the bridge, were laid logs of nearly uniform size, and these were ballasted on either hand by sticks of timber which extended parallel with the stringers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The driveway between these timbers, which <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> was <measure n="11feet" type="distance">eleven feet</measure> wide, was covered with earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The approach to the bridge from the south side was of raised corduroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The length of the whole structure, including the approaches, was <measure n="4200feet" type="distance">4,200 feet</measure>. The length of the bridge proper was nearly <measure n="1100feet" type="distance">1,100 feet</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Having crossed, we moved forward over the corduroy, through the wood, into the open country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The surface, as you proceed southerly from the river, varies from low bottom land with patches of morass to undulating swell; this again is broken by shallow valleys, through which sluggish rivulets flow, fed by springs along their banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>The annual slow decay of the rank vegetation on the banks of these low, damp water-courses, which were the natural outlets of the drainage of the camps, contributed to make this section south of the river a busy place for the hospital steward, and to increase the number of respondents to sick-call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>Into this region we were now moving, and an observation of the infantry and artillery, that during the day were along the route with us, led us to infer that the remainder of the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> was being brought across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>This inference was, however, hasty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>It was only <placeName reg="Franklin, Franklin, Virginia" key="tgn,2111847">Franklin</placeName>'s corps; <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00047.00492" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Josiah,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s remained on the left bank till after the battle of <placeName reg="Gaines, Henry, Missouri" key="tgn,2058849">Gaines' Farm</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>It was the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 6">Sixth Army Corps</orgName>, that was being moved out to positions on the right of the advanced forces, which had been for weeks on the south side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>In front of the infantry of this part of the line was a tract of hard timber, and through this wood, <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile away, a portion of it along the banks of a ravine which led to the north, was the right section of our picket line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>From these pickets, ranged along the ravine, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would be about west perhaps <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> away, their posts being probably the nearest approach they had yet made to the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> stronghold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/><pb id="p.48" n="48"/></p> 
<p>Some of us, who were <num value="1">one</num> day detailed to accompany a sergeant and artificers out into the woods a short distance in the rear of our picket-line, to construct, under the direction of <persName n="Arnold,Colonel,,,," id="n0193.0006.00048.00498" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,Richard,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName>, a lookout, had an opportunity to observe the position of a portion of this section of the vedettes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Having arrived at the spot where it was designed to build the structure, we were set to cutting timber, from which stout steps or rounds of a ladder were to be fashioned by the artificer, which it seemed were to be secured to a huge old oak on the <num value="1">one</num> hand and on the other to a tall standard which was to be planted in the ground, perhaps <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> from the base of the tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The colonel, after giving necessary orders as to the work, directed us, in case of the falling back of the pickets, to retire; and as he was about to leave us to our work, he remarked that when in want of water we could fill our canteens at a spring in a ravine in our front, indicating the direction by pointing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>So, later in the day, several of us went to the spring, which we found to be well down the left slope of the ravine, a basin of pure, cold water bubbling from many a vent in a bed of clean white sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>A rivulet made its way from the spring to the creek which ran through the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>As we reach the bank of this valley we see beyond, on the other side, a clearing in which is a cornfield, through which extended the <rs>Confederate</rs> picket-line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Occasionally an individual was seen plainly enough, but there was no firing in that part of the line; indeed, it was said that previously, the spring, by the then position of our pickets, was between the lines and was visited by the boys from both sides; at any rate there were the boys in gray a few rods yonder, and all was quiet as would be a Sunday ramble in a Maine wood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The intensely hot weather during this fortnight in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> had a various influence upon the different temperaments and dispositions of the soldiers in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>Some were quite enervated and despondent, seeming to catch through the veil a glimpse of misfortune to our arms; some who were constitutionally irascible were heated to contention; others, and the greater number, were warmed into a glow of patriotic ardor, and were impelled to express their faith in the commander of the army and the triumph of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>The veil that hid the disaster, now near at hand, was impenetrable to all, but the volunteer ever seeks to pierce it with his inevitable, ceaseless conjectures, which are born <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> of restless impatience of restraint, and flights of fancy, in which camp life often gives him leisure to indulge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Sometimes there would arise ludicrous, petty differences between officers of different arms of the service, as to the limits of their camps, and most amusing charges of encroachment upon <num value="1">one</num> another's domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>We have observed <persName n="Slocum,General,,,," id="n0193.0006.00049.00499" reg="nearbymention:Slocum,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Slocum</surname></persName> called in as arbitrator, walking beside the appellant, blowing a thin cloud of smoke from his cigar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>We have overheard a comrade exclaim, as he watched the pale, thin, quiet face, <q direct="unspecified">Well, is n't he the coolest man you ever saw?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>This remark was recalled on the night of <dateStruct value="-06-30"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="30">30</day></dateStruct>, when we saw the general stirred with righteous anger which had anything but a cool effect on those upon whom it was justly visited.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>Rumors of every sort were rife during this time, of movements made at other points in the <rs>Federal</rs> line, and of those about to be made from our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Newspapers found their way into camp with tolerable regularity, which gave us their versions of the doings of troops on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, in the valley, or on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Speculation, baseless indeed, was active in the minds of the privates; but nothing palpable had occurred to indicate the subsequent change of base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Supplies continued to be sent from the <rs>Pamunkey</rs> to <placeName reg="Savage's Station">Savage's Station</placeName>, east of us, our immediate depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The hackneyed phrase <q direct="unspecified">All quiet along the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>,</q> had become well worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>This was an effort, that succeeded, to drive in Confederate pickets in the woods, before the <rs>Federal</rs> left, in order to give the <rs>Union</rs> forces command of cleared fields, still farther in advance; the fighting continued all day, from <time value="9am">nine A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>No, not immediately; we remain in line expectant; the contiguous infantry with arms stacked are similarly waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Hark! there is firing across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>It seemed to be in the neighborhood of the camp we occupied in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, at <placeName reg="Gaines, Henry, Missouri" key="tgn,2058849">Gaines' Farm</placeName>. &apos;T is past noon; we are still waiting at <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Now the firing is louder and more rapid as we approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>This route seems the same by which we came to the camp which we have just left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>The roads show that heavy teams have lately passed over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>It must have been past <num value="3">three</num> when the infantry and artillery of our division reached the field upon the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>The Federal line, with its left upon <placeName reg="Gaines Mill, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2343405">Gaines' Mill</placeName> stream, was evidently severely pressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>The entire <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line and reserves are engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>They have evidently been moved forward to repel the continued assaults along the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Some of the infantry and a battery of our division which have just arrived are pushed directly forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>There go a regiment and a battery to the left toward <placeName reg="Gaines Mill, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2343405">Gaines' Mill</placeName> stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>Now, midst the din and confusion, the screaming of shot and shell, the shrieking of minie balls, <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Bartlett,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00051.00514" reg="nearbymention:Bartlett,J.,J.,,"><surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> and the <orgName type="regiment" key="1MABattery">First Massachusetts Battery</orgName> were sent to the right, where <orgName n="division"><persName n="Sykes,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00051.00515" reg="mostcommon:Sykes,nomatch:0"><surname>Sykes</surname></persName>' division</orgName> and <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Griffin,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00051.00516" reg="mostcommon:Griffin,nomatch:0"><surname>Griffin</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> for more than an hour had firmly held their ground against repeated stubborn attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Never was a reinforcement more welcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>Speedily we moved up and onward to the right, where, forming the right section of an <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> arc, partly in the woods, and partly in the open ground reaching toward the rear of <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>, the troops of <persName n="Sykes,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00052.00517" reg="mostcommon:Sykes,nomatch:0"><surname>Sykes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Griffin,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00052.00518" reg="mostcommon:Griffin,nomatch:0"><surname>Griffin</surname></persName> were desperately stemming the tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Our guns are unlimbered, and caissons move to the rear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>It was without doubt the material aid afforded by <persName n="Slocum,General,,,," id="n0193.0006.00052.00520" reg="nearbymention:Slocum,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Slocum</surname></persName>'s reinforcement of this part of the line, at this juncture, that saved the <rs>Federal</rs> right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Let this fact be remembered to the credit of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 6">Sixth Army Corps</orgName> and the gallant commander of its <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName>, whose command in an equal emergency at <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName> helped retrieve the failing fortunes of the day, and who himself afterward commanded the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of our army at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>It was perhaps <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>, when, upon the left of our position, seemingly in the centre of the <rs>Federal</rs> line, as we try to picture in our minds a line drawn along the crest of the range of heights from <placeName reg="Gaines Mill, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2343405">Gaines' Mill</placeName> to our position on the right already described, the heavy firing indicates that the enemy is trying the same tactics that have failed upon the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>The sounds do not settle back toward the river, so we judge that the centre stands firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>For half an hour this continued, when the din of conflict seemed to be transferred to the extreme left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Now the sounds seem to be floating to our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Have the <rs>Confederates</rs> massed their forces upon the right of their line, to destroy <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00052.00521" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Josiah,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> and <persName n="McCall,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00052.00522" reg="mostcommon:McCall,nomatch:0"><surname>McCall</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>The infantry contiguous to us seem to have been ordered to fall back; we limber up and move toward the left and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Still the cannonade upon the left continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>As we draw nearer, there comes to our ears a yell that suggests that there is a charge in progress on the <rs>Confederate</rs> right flank; but, drawing yet nearer, there was a scene of confusion in the rear of the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>Infantry seemed to be retreating to the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Batteries were withdrawing, not at a walk, but overrunning the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Our approach added to the confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>But at this moment, a column from the south side of the river appears upon the scene; they have <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">Second Corps</orgName> badges; 'tis French and <persName n="Meagher,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00052.00523" reg="mostcommon:Meagher,nomatch:0"><surname>Meagher</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>They push through the retreating masses; the latter are rallied, and with new courage follow behind the fresh brigades, ready to meet a new attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>The enemy seemed to be aware of the arrival of reinforcements; there was a brief exchange of shots, then a lull, as darkness settled upon the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>It is said that when the <rs>Federal</rs> line broke on the <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> left, <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00053.00524" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Josiah,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> had called into action all his artillery, and was effectively checking the <rs>Confederate</rs> advance, while at the same time withdrawing, under cover of the artillery fire, his infantry; when the horses of <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Cooke,General,,,," id="n0193.0006.00053.00525" reg="mostcommon:Cooke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cooke</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>, which had been attempting to charge the enemy, becoming unmanageable, wheeled about and galloped among the gunners, who, being without infantry support, and supposing a charge made upon them, the batteries were hastily withdrawn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>This perhaps explains the scene of confusion which met the eyes of <orgName n="division"><persName n="French,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00053.00526" reg="mostcommon:French,Charles,H.,,:1"><surname>French</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> and the <orgName n="Irish Brigade" type="brigade">Irish brigade</orgName>, when they reached the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>During the night, the <rs>Federal</rs> forces were withdrawn to the right bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>The last of the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName>, crossing after daylight, destroyed the bridge behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>It was in the thick darkness that immediately precedes day, that our company reached the camp which it left before the battle, and where yet was its necessary baggage and some commissary and quartermaster's stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Much needed refreshment and a brief rest for man and beast were hardly enjoyed, when our command and all the troops in that vicinity were again in motion, this time toward the southeast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>This hot, gloomy <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> was quiet as an old fashioned <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Sabbath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>There was something ominous in the stillness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>No <num value="1">one</num> of the rank and file knew the true condition of the army, or its destination, but the surmise was general that we were going to the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>Indeed, the <rs>Confederates</rs> must have been hours in possession of <persName n="Whitehouse,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00053.00529" reg="mostcommon:Whitehouse,nomatch:0"><surname>Whitehouse</surname></persName> and the <orgName n="York River Railroad" type="railroad">York River Railroad</orgName> up to the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>In the light of subsequent events, it is now evident that we were at this time creeping along between <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n0193.0006.00053.00530" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName>'s force in front of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and the great bulk of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> on the north bank of the river.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>This was of brief duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>There was no meeting of contending forces that day, but a painfully <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> slow, agonizing motion of endless trains of artillery, army wagons, and ambulances with their sad burdens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>But where were those wounded who could not bear the jolt and swaying of the ambulances?

<p>Certainly the awful suspense of <dateStruct value="-06-28"><day type="name">Saturday</day>, <month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="28">28</day></dateStruct>, and the night following, were more trying to the spirit of the soldier than the combats that ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>The narrow ways were choked with cavalry, teams, and infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>The monster procession moved at a snail's pace; the day wore away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>We cannot say where we passed the night of the <num value="28" type="ordinal">28th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>It must have been as late as the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> of the month when the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 6">Sixth Corps</orgName> commenced its march across the peninsula towards <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>We made speed as if it were a forced march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>To drop from the column was to be left behind; yet excessive thirst compelled men to hasten through wood or field to fill canteens. &apos;T was pitiful in the extreme to see some fever-stricken comrade from a wagon beckoning to the bearer of a canteen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>So saw we oft during the day poor <persName n="Knowles,,,,," id="n0193.0007.00067.00619" reg="mostcommon:Knowles,Stephen,,,:1"><surname>Knowles</surname></persName> making the sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Though there was a super-abundance of that fruit, it must have been a late variety, since not a ripe peach could be found; all were as hard as military bread, and much more <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> unpalatable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>A cupful of this, smoking from the kettle, was indeed appetizing, for the air of the bay induces a keen relish for wholesome food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>This account of the woman having been heard by <num value="1">one</num> of the boys who was to go upon the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> relief, the lad looked somewhat askance at the lady as she appeared at the door, when he turned at the farther end of his beat, and perceived her watching <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> him as he approached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Just then <num value="2">two</num> nags thrust their heads toward the door and were repulsed by the woman, who then beckoned to the boy to approach, which he did, expecting to receive a rating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>To his agreeable surprise, the good woman unfolded a clean towel, displayed a nice loaf of fresh bread, and handed it to him, asking if he had been to dinner, and remarking that he might share it with some of his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>We, who later enjoyed the loaf with him, could relate many an incident of woman's kindness in the <rs>District</rs> and in Secessia, to those soldiers who were civil and respectful to her as was her due.</p>
