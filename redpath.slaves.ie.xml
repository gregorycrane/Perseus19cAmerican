<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>To you, Old Hero, I dedicate this record of my Talks with the <name>Slaves</name> in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>To you is due our homage for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> showing how, and how alone, the gigantic crime of our age and nation can be effectually blotted out from our soil forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>You have proven that the slaver has a soul as cowardly as his own <quote>domestic institution ;</quote> you have shown how contemptible he is as a foe before the rifle of the earnest freeman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>With your sword of the <rs>Lord</rs> and of <persName><foreName>Gideon</foreName></persName> you met him face to face ; with a few ill-clad and ill-armed footmen, you routed his well-mounted and well-armed hosts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I admire you for your dauntless bravery on the field; but more for your religious integrity of character and resolute energy of anti-slavery zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Rifle in hand, you put the brave young men of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> to shame ; truth in heart, you rendered insignificant the puerile programmes of anti-slavery politicians.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>You have no confidence in any man, plan or party that ignores moral principle as the soul of its action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>You well know that an Organized Iniquity can never be destroyed by any programme of action which overlooks the fact that it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a crime, and is therefore to be eradicated without compromise, commiseration or delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>This, also, is my; belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Hence do I doubt the ultimate efficacy of any political <pb id="p.iv" n="iv"/>anti-slavery action which is founded on Expediency &mdash; the morals of the counting-room &mdash; and hence, also, I do not hesitate to urge the friends of the slave to incite insurrections, and encourage, in the <rs>North</rs>, a spirit which shall ultimate in civil and servile wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I think it unfair that the <rs>American</rs> bondman should have no generous <placeName key="tgn,7013848;tgn,2444046;tgn,2444045;tgn,2112551;tgn,2084984;tgn,2004146" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013848;lafayette, tippecanoe, indiana,Tippecanoe,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2444046;lafayette, onondaga, new york,Onondaga,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2444045;lafayette, walker, georgia,Walker,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2112551;lafayette, montgomery, virginia,Montgomery,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2084984;lafayette, yam hill, oregon,Yamhill,Oregon,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2004146;lafayette, chambers, alabama,Chambers,Alabama,United States,North and Central America" reg="lafayette, tippecanoe, indiana,Tippecanoe,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;lafayette, onondaga, new york,Onondaga,New York,United States,North and Central America;lafayette, walker, georgia,Walker,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;lafayette, montgomery, virginia,Montgomery,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;lafayette, yam hill, oregon,Yamhill,Oregon,United States,North and Central America;lafayette, chambers, alabama,Chambers,Alabama,United States,North and Central America">Lafayette</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The oppressions of which the men of &lsquo;<num value="76">76</num> complained through the muzzles of their guns and with the points of their bayonets, were trifling &mdash; unworthy of a moment's discussion &mdash; as compared with the cruel and innumerable wrongs which the negroes of the <rs>South</rs> now endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>If the fathers were justified in <hi rend="italics">their</hi> rebellion, how much more will the slaves be justifiable in <hi rend="italics">their</hi> insurrection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>You, Old Hero!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>believe that the slave should be aided and urged to insurrection, and hence do I lay this tribute at your feet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>You are unwilling to ignore the rights of the slave for any reason &mdash; any <quote>constitutional guarantees</quote> --any plea of vested rights &mdash; any argument of inferiority of race &mdash; any sophistry of Providential overrulings, or pitiable appeals for party success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>You are willing to recognize the negro as a brother, however inferior in intellectual endowments; as having rights, which, to take away, or withhold, is a crime that should be punished without mercy &mdash; surely &mdash; promptly &mdash; by law, if we can do it ; <hi rend="italics">over</hi> it, if more speedily by such action; peacefully if we can, but forcibly and by bloodshed if we must So am I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/></p> 
<p>You went to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, when the troubles broke out there &mdash; not to <quote>settle</quote> or <quote>speculate</quote> --or from idle curiosity: but for <num value="1">one</num> stern, solitary purpose--<hi rend="italics">to have a shot at the <rs>South</rs></hi>. So did I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/></p> 
<p>To you, therefore, my senior in years as in services to the slave, I dedicate this work.</p>

<head>My creed.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In order that no man, or body of men, may be injured or misrepresented by unfair presentations or perversions of my creed, or induced to peruse the pages that follow, under false impressions or pretences, I will here briefly state my political, or rather my revolutionary Faith:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I am a Republican--and something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I am inflexibly opposed to the extension of slavery; but equally do I oppose the doctrine of its protection in States where it already exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Non-intervention and protection are practically synonymous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Let slavery alone, and it lives a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Fight it, and it dies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Any weapons will kill it, if kept ever active: fire or water &mdash; bayonets or bullion &mdash; the soldier's arm or the writer's pen. To prevent its extension merely, will never destroy it. If it is right that slavery should exist in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, it is equally right to extend it into <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If the inter-state traffic in human beings is right, equally just is the demand for re-opening the slave trade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I am an Emancipationist &mdash; and something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I believe slavery to be a curse, which it is desirable to speedily abolish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But to Gradual Emancipation I am resolutely antagonistic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>For I regard property in man as robbery of man ; and I am not willing that our robbers should give notes on time &mdash; for freedom and justice at <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>, or <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, or any other period: rather let them be smitten <pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/>down where they stand, and the rights that they have wrested from their slaves, be wrested &mdash; if necessary &mdash; with bloodshed and violence, with the torch and the rifle, from them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I am an American-and something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I think it wrong to give to foreigners the rights that we deny to native-born <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0060.0003.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I think it wrong and tyrannical for <num value="1">one</num> class of persons &mdash; sometimes citizens of foreign birth &mdash; to vote for, disfranchise, whip, sell, buy, breed for market, and otherwise degrade the colored natives of our Southern soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I regard the decision of <persName n="Taney,Judge,,,," id="n0060.0003.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Taney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName>, and his brethren, as not infamous only, but insulting to our national character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I would extend to all <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0060.0003.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, without distinction of color or creed, the inalienable birthright of whistling <persName n="Doodle,,Yankee,,," id="n0060.0003.00000.00007" reg="default:Doodle,Yankee,,,"><foreName>Yankee</foreName> <surname>Doodle</surname></persName>, and hurrahing, with heart-felt emphasis, on the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and after every presidential election-unless <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0060.0003.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> is again a successful candidate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I am an Abolitionist-and something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I am in favor, not only of <hi rend="italics">abolishing</hi> the <name>Curse</name>, but of making <hi rend="italics">reparation</hi> for the <name>Crime</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Not an Abolitionist only, but a Reparationist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The negroes, I hold, have not merely the inalienable right to be free, but the legal right of compensation for their hitherto unrequited services to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I more than agree with the <rs>Disunion Abolitionists</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They are in favor of a free Northern Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>So am I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But as to boundary lines we differ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>While they would fix the <rs>Southern</rs> boundary of their free Republic at the dividing line between <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and the <rs>Keystone State</rs>, I would wash it with the warm waters of the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>. <quote>But what shall we do with the slaves?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Make free men of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><quote>And with the slaveholding class?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Abolish them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><quote>And with the <name>Legrees</name> of the plantations?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Them, annihilate!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Drive them into the sea, as <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0060.0003.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> once drove the swine; or chase them into the dismal swamps and black morasses of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><quote>Anywhere &mdash; anywhere &mdash; out of the world!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/><pb id="p.vii" n="vii"/></p> 
<p>I am a Peace-Man &mdash; and something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I would fight and kill for the sake of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Now, slavery is a state of perpetual war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I am a Non-Resistant &mdash; and something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>I would slay every man who attempted to resist the liberation of the slave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>I am a Democrat--and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I believe in humanity and human rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I recognize nothing as so sacred on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Rather than consent to the infringement of the most insignificant or seemingly unimportant of human rights, let races be swept from the face of the earth &mdash; let nations be dismembered &mdash; let dynasties be dethroned &mdash; let laws and governments, religions and reputations be cast out and trodden under feet of men!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This is my creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>For myself, I am an earnest man. If you think proper, now, to accompany me &mdash; come on; if not, <hi rend="italics">au revoir</hi>--and may the <rs>Lord</rs> have mercy on your soul!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>He was a mulatto of about <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> of age. His eyes and his conversation showed him to be a person kind hearted yet resolute of purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The tone of his voice, the expression of his face, bespoke a man familiar with sorrow and cares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>He was very intelligent and used exceedingly few negro phrases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>He had been a slave, but had bought his freedom; and since that time had purchased his wife, brother, sister-in-law, with <hi rend="italics">her</hi> husband and their <num value="2">two</num> young children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Hie had been rather favored as a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>He had had a kind proprietor, who had permitted him to hire himself &mdash; that is to say, to pay to his master a certain sum monthly for the use of his own bodily strength and mental faculties, retaining as his own funds whatever he might make <quote>over and above</quote> <pb id="p.12" n="12"/>the sum thus agreed upon between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>He had been a porter at a popular hotel, and was lucky enough to soon save sufficient with which to purchase his freedom from his owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The next money he got was expended on articles of traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>He prospered in his small retail trade, and with its earliest profits he purchased his wife.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>What a low state of morals, by the way, does it indicate, when a robber, <hi rend="italics">in fact</hi>, of the lion's share of a poor man's wages is spoken of as a kind and indulgent master!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>How unspeakably mean, too, to live on money thus ungenerously taken from the hard hands of lowly, unprotected toil!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/><quote> You have acted nobly,</quote> I said to him, <quote>in buying <num value="7">seven</num> persons from slavery, and you must have been very lucky to be able to do it, as well as to buy this house.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/><quote>Ah, sir!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>said the good man, in a sad tone, <quote>I wish I could do something more effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It's all I live for. No <num value="1">one</num>,</quote> he added, <quote>can have any idea of how our people are persecuted here, only on account of their color.</quote>

<head>Oppressive laws and ordinances.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/><quote>Indeed!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>I said, <quote>I wish you would tell me some of the methods employed by the whites in persecuting your people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>I will publish them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/></p> 
<p>He named a host of them, from which I selected at the time the following particulars:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/><num value="1">1</num>. The oath of a colored man, whether free or a slave, is not admissible in courts of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Therefore, <pb id="p.13" n="13"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>If a white man owes a debt to a person of color, and refuses to pay it, it is impossible for the creditor to resort to legal remedies in order to collect it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If a white man, from any cause or motive &mdash; for the purpose, for example, of extorting money &mdash; chooses to swear before a court that any colored person, whether free or slave, has been insolent to him, he can cause the unfortunate object of his malice to be whipped by the public officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>If a worthless vagabond, with a white skin, however black his heart may be, enters the store of a free man of color, and steals, <hi rend="italics">even before the owner's eyes</hi>, any articles from it, the unfortunate merchant has no legal remedy, unless a white man saw the property thus feloniously appropriated &mdash; for the fear of the municipal lash restrains him from entering a public complaint or resenting the robbery on the spot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Thus the blacks are always at the mercy of the whites &mdash; a position which no <hi rend="italics">un</hi>colored person, I am sure, would be willing to occupy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In stating these facts, my informant related an incident which I shall narrate here, as it is at once a most striking illustration of the injustice sometimes practised by <quote>our Southern brethren</quote> toward their colored fellow creatures, and serves to show the practical workings of the laws relating to the oaths of persons of the subjugated race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>A few weeks before this interview, a white man went to the green market and was putting some vegetable &mdash; parsley, I believe &mdash; in his basket, when the colored woman in attendance asked him if he had measured it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>He turned round fiercely and asked what she meant by insulting him. Next day he <pb id="p.14" n="14"/>took out a warrant, had the market woman brought before the mayor, and swore positively, as did his son also, that she had used insolent and abusive language to him. She would have been whipped, as usual, and had her sentence chronicled in the papers as the punishment of a <quote>worthless free negro,</quote> if several white persons, who were present at the time and knew her to be an honest inoffensive soul, had not promptly stepped up and swore that she was innocent of the offence charged by the plaintiff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>She was therefore discharged; but the cowardly perjurers were not even reprimanded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/><num value="2">2</num>. Although free men of color pay the same municipal taxes levied on white citizens, they are not only prohibited from exercising any influence in elections, but from entering the public square or the white man's cemetery.</p>

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Not many years ago, <hi rend="italics">free</hi> girl from the opposite side of the river, incautiously entered the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> without her certificate of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>She was arrested, <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>kept in prison <measure n="40days" type="date">forty days</measure>, and then sold into perpetual bondage, for the <rs>Southern</rs> crime known as <quote>being at large!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>As she said so I felt inclined to reply that perhaps Southern slaveholders had no idea how many and how insurrectionary the reasons were that are daily tending to array them <num value="1">one</num> against the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>I did not say so, however, for the lady was a slaveholder, and I was in her house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>They would as soon think of inquiring into the sentiments of their horses on <hi rend="italics">their</hi> position, as to interrogate the slaves as to <hi rend="italics">their</hi> ideas of bondage.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>With a rush, and a roar, and a sweeping force, on came the filthy flood of speech again, all the fouler, and stronger and wilder, from that attempted check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>The chance was too good to be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>Probably many of them had never seen an abolitionist before, and <pb id="p.80" n="80"/>never again would have such an opportunity of unburdening their minds in such a presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>I saw so much that was noble, generous and admirable in their characters; I saw so many demoralizing pro-slavery influences &mdash; various, attractive, resistless &mdash; brought to bear on their intellects from their cradle to their tomb, that from hating I began to pity them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>It is not at all surprising that the people of the <rs>South</rs> are so indifferent to the rights of the <name>African</name> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>For, as far as the negro is concerned, the press, the pulpit, the bench, the bar, and the stump, conspire with a unity of purpose and pertinacity of zeal, which is no less lamentable than extraordinary, to eradicate every sentiment of justice and brotherhood from their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>They sincerely believe Wrong to be Right, and act on that unhappy conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>They know not what they do.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>They are sincere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>Far less criminal are they therefore, in my opinion, than such moral outcasts as G---S---, who once publicly uttered the revolting declaration, that, if every slave in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> could be instantly liberated by a single prayer, he &mdash; for <num value="1">one</num>--would not offer it up!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>But sincerity is not enough, in the eye of the moral law. It is necessary, also, to be right; to abstain from violating the law.

<p> Sir, I am gratified to perceive that no gentleman has yet risen in this hall the avowed advocate of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>I even regret, sir, that we should find those amongst us who enter the lists of discussion as its <hi rend="italics">apologists</hi>, except alone upon the ground of uncontrollable necessity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/> Sir, if there be <num value="1">one</num> who concurs with that gentleman in the harmless character of this institution, let me request him to compare the condition of the slaveholding portion of this commonwealth &mdash; barren, desolate and seared, as it were, by the avenging hand of heaven &mdash; with the descriptions which we have of <pb id="p.108" n="108"/>this same country from those who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> broke its virgin soil?</p>

<p> The existence of slavery creates a political interest in the <rs>Union</rs>, which is of all others the most <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> positive; an interest which, in relation to those who do not possess it, is adversary and exclusive; <num value="1">one</num> which marks the manners of our country by a corresponding distinction, and is sowing broadcast amongst us, both in our official and private intercourse, the seeds of unkindness and suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>On this interest geographical parties have been formed; on its maintenance or restriction the bitterest struggles have been waged in Congress; and, as it contains an ingredient of political power in our Federal Constitution, it will always be the subject of struggle; always defended by the most vigilant care, and assailed by the most subtile counter action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>Slaveholding and nonslaveholding must necessarily constitute the characteristic feature of our country-must necessarily form the broad and indivisible interest upon which parties will combine, and will and does comprehend, in the jealousies which now surround it, the smothered and powerful, but, I hope, not the irresistible causes of future dismemberment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>To all of its other evils, then, slavery superadds the still further <num value="1">one</num> of being a cause of national dissension &mdash; of being a fixed and repulsive element between the different members of our Republic-itself impelling with strong tendency, and aggravating all smaller tendencies to political distrust, alienation and hostility.</p></quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>I mean by vagabonds, simply, people without habitual, definite occupation or reliable means of livelihood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>They are poor, having almost no property but their own bodies; and the use of these, that is, their labor, they are not accustomed to hire out statedly and regularly, so as to obtain capital by wages, but only occasionally by the day or job, when driven to it by necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>A family of these people will commonly hire, or <q direct="unspecified">squat </q> and build, a little log cabin, so made that it is only a shelter from <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>rain, the sides not being clinked, and having no more furniture or pretension to comfort than is commonly provided a criminal in the cell of a prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>They will cultivate a little corn, and possibly a few roods of potatoes, cow-peas and coleworts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>They will own a few swine, that find their living in the forest; and pretty certainly, also, a rifle and dogs; and the men, ostensibly, occupy most of their time in hunting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>A gentleman of <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville</placeName> told me that he had, several times appraised, under oath, the whole household property of families of this class at less than <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure>. If they have need of money to purchase clothing, etc., they obtain it by selling their game or meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>If they have none of this to spare, or an insufficiency, they will work for a neighboring farmer for a few days, and they usually get for their labor <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> a day, <hi rend="italics">finding themselves</hi>. The farmers say that they do not like to employ them, because they cannot be relied upon to finish what they undertake, or to work according to directions; and because, being white men, they cannot <q direct="unspecified">drive</q> them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>That is to say, their labor is even more inefficient and unmanageable than that of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>That I have not formed an exaggerated estimate of the proportion of such a class, will appear to the reader more probable from the testimony of a pious colporteur, given before a public meeting in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1855-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>I quote from a Charleston paper's report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>The colporteur had been stationed at----county, N. C. :--<q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">The larger portion</hi> of the inhabitants seemed to be totally given up to a species of mental hallucination, which carried them captive at its will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>They nearly all believed implicitly in witchcraft, and attributed everything that happened, good or bad, to the agency of persons whom they supposed possessed of evil spirits.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>The majority of what I have termed turpentine-farmers &mdash; meaning the small proprietors of the long-leafed pine forest land, are people but a grade superior, in character or condition, to these vagabonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>They have habitations more like houses &mdash; log-cabins, commonly, sometimes chinked, oftener not &mdash; without windows of glass, but with a few pieces of substantial old-fashioned heir-loom furniture; a vegetable garden, in which, however, you will find no vegetable but what they call <q direct="unspecified">collards</q> (colewort) for <q direct="unspecified">greens</q>; fewer dogs; more swine, and larger clearings for maize, but no better crops than the poorer class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>Their property is, nevertheless, often of considerable money value, consisting mainly of negroes, who, associating intimately with their masters, are of superior intelligence to the slaves of the wealthier classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>The larger proprietors, who are also often cotton planters, cultivating the richer low lands, are, sometimes, gentlemen of good estate &mdash; intelligent, cultivated and hospitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>The number of these, however, is extremely small.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>Although the pestilence had raged in <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> with terrible fatality for more than a month, no case of yellow fever had as yet occurred in the town of <placeName reg="Hamburg, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095935">Hamburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>I have been told by Northern ladies that, during their visits to the <rs>South</rs>, they have sometimes asked the female slaves if they would not like to be free, and were astonished at receiving a reply in the negative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>I have sometimes heard the same question asked of slaves, in order to convince me of their contentment, and have heard it answered as the <name>Southron</name> desired; and yet, within a few days, the same negroes have uttered in my presence the saddest laments over their unfortunate condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>Why? Because I did not ask the negro as if I honored him by condescending to hold a conversation with him. I did not speak in a careless or patronizing tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>This circumstance accounts for the difference of statements made by the same person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>Topsy's remark about <rs type="role2">Miss</rs> &lsquo;Phelia's aversion to her is a true touch of negro nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>Northerners generally confine themselves to cities, and judge of the condition of country slaves from the condition of the bondmen of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>This is a great error, and the source of unnumbered errors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>The tar, pitch, and turpentine planters, or rather plantation lease-holders, of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, are principally supplied with their hands from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>These masters in the Old Dominion often own no land, but live by hiring out their human stock from year to year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>(I once got myself into hot water by calling a lady who lived on the hire-money of her slaves, a kept woman &mdash; kept by negroes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>Slaves have told me so. Cotton, tobacco, rice, and sugar plantation slaves are worked from sun to sun. Their food and lodging varies very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>They are not so well fed as, they could not be worse lodged than, the turpentine plantation and railroad hands, but in <num value="1">one</num> respect their condition is vastly preferable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>They held the property under the name of another person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>In the cities, the slaves &mdash; excepting the household slaves &mdash; are generally allowed to <quote>hire their <hi rend="italics">own</hi> time,</quote> as, with hidden sarcasm, the negroes term it: that is to say, they give their master a certain sum per month; and all that they make over that amount they retain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>As negroes are usually a temperate and economical class of persons, the <rs>Southern</rs> city slaves sometimes save money enough to purchase their freedom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>What, therefore, may be true of city slaves is no indication of the condition of rural bondmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>The Southern ladies, as a class, are opposed to emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>They are reared under the shadow of the peculiar institution; in their nurseries and <pb id="p.184" n="184"/>their parlors, by their preachers, orators and editors, they hear it incessantly praised and defended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>Their conscience, thus early perverted, is never afterwards appealed to. They seldom see its most obnoxious features; never attend auctions; never witness <quote>examinations;</quote> seldom, if ever, see the negroes lashed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>They do not know negro slavery as it is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>Yet, it is nevertheless true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>They do not know that the inter-State trade in slaves is a gigantic commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>Thus, for example, <persName n="Tyler,Mrs.,,,," id="n0060.0005.00184.00186" reg="mostcommon:Tyler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, in her letter to the <rs>Duchess</rs> of <persName n="Sutherland,,,,," id="n0060.0005.00184.00187" reg="mostcommon:Sutherland,nomatch:0"><surname>Sutherland</surname></persName>, said that the slaves are very seldom separated from their families!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>Yet, statistics prove that <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> slaves are annually sold from the <rs>Northern</rs> slave-breeding to the <rs>Southern</rs> slave-needing States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>And I know, also, that I have seen families separated and sold in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; and I know still further, that I have spoken to upwards of <num value="500">five hundred</num> slaves in the <name>Carolinas</name> alone who were sold, in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, from their wives and children.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>The window that looks into the balustrade has evidently been undisturbed by water, cloth or brush for several months past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>By placing your hand, flat on the outside, you can secure an accurate delineation of it, quicker than a daguerrean artist could take it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object that presented itself to my astonished gaze on entering the room, was a nameless vessel, appropriate to sleeping apartments, which the servants had placed in as conspicuous a position as if it had been a glass globe containing gold-fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>The papering of the room was variously bedaubed and torn; the window opposite the door was nearly as dirty as its mate; a dirty, old, sun-stained curtain, <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>of colored calico, <hi rend="italics">unhemmed</hi>, and torn in <hi rend="italics"><num value="17">seventeen</num></hi> different places, hung mournfully over it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3422"/>Let me here subjoin the general results and miscellaneous incidents of my travels and conversations, without any especial regard to rhetorical order or intrinsic importance of topic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3423"/>I. I do not believe that the progress of physical science, the extension of railroads, or the exhausting effects of involuntary labor, will ever induce or compel the peaceful abolition of American slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/><pb id="p.256" n="256"/>Worn out lands will be recuperated by scientific skill, by guano, rotation of crops, the steam plough, and the knowledge &mdash; now rapidly diffusing &mdash; of agricultural chemistry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>Railroads raise both the price and value of slave labor, by rapidly conveying the rural products of it, to the <rs>Northern</rs> and <rs>European</rs> markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3426"/>Slave labor, although detrimental to the <rs>State</rs>, is profitable to the individual holders of human <quote>property.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>Do n't cross over by the swamp, or the old ford</quote>--<num value="2">two</num> nearer footpaths to the town, skirting heavily timbered land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>I cannot recollect now whether I had heard before of an insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3615"/>I had not, certainly thought much about it, if at all. But I knew, instantly, why these armed citizens were at the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>The low, compressed, yet clear voice of the captain &mdash; the silence of his men &mdash; their audible breathing as they waited for my replies to his questions &mdash; their military order &mdash; with sentries in advance &mdash; told me all, and I experienced a dread which chilled me through; and the deepening shade of the forest, under which I had so often whistled merrily, served now to add to the gloom of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>I asked no questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3618"/>With quickened pace I pushed up the main road, and was not long in reaching my father's house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>I wished to know the worst, and to help in meeting it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3620"/>I found all alarm at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>I inquired and learned here the cause and extent of the danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3624"/><pb id="p.272" n="272"/></p> 
<p>That morning a negro had informed his master of the plot, and had represented to him that it reached plantations over a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> off, and embraced the thickest negro settlements of the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3625"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step taken was to arrest the leaders named (some <num value="30">thirty</num> in number) by the informer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to inform the town and country of the impending danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3627"/>Armed patrols were started out in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3628"/>Every avenue to the town was guarded, and every house in it made a sort of military fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>The apprehension was, that the plantation negroes would rise and sweep all before them with fire and sword; and the <quote>white strength</quote> was prepared, in all its force, to meet the contingency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>The master, if he be kind to his bondmen, is apt to believe that they will never turn against him. We hear planters say, <quote>I would arm my slaves,</quote> whenever this subject is broached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>This is a strong expression, and to be received with <quote>grains of allowance,</quote> as the sequel will illustrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>Yet, boy-like, I felt as if no soul in our yard could strike a blow against <num value="1">one</num> of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>I went to the servants' quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of them was out &mdash; a strange event &mdash; and not a neighbor's domestic was in &mdash; a still stranger circumstance!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>They were silent as the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/><quote>Even <q direct="unspecified">Mamma,</q> </quote> privileged to say and do what she pleased, and who could be heard amid the laughter and tongue clatter of the rest, had nothing to tell me. I asked a few questions; they were simply answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>It was evident that the servants were frightened; they knew not what they feared; but they were spell-bound by an undefined dread of evil to them and harm to us. Indeed, this was the <pb id="p.273" n="273"/>case with the blacks, generally; and while the excitement lasted, the patrol did not arrest <num value="1">one</num> slave away from his quarters!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>An honest <name>Irishman</name> remarked at the time, <quote>it was hard to tell which was most frightened, the whites or the negroes.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>It embraced a region having over <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> male slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/>But the plot was poorly arranged, and it was clear that those who planned it knew little or nothing of the power they had to meet and master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>For <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> the leaders of it had been brooding over their design, and <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before its consummation they were in prison and virtually doomed as felons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3643"/>Then seizure arrested the insurrection without bloodshed; but not without a sacrifice of life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3644"/>That was demanded by society and the law. <num value="13">Thirteen</num> of the negroes arrested were declared guilty and hung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3645"/>They had, according to all notions then, a fair trial; lawyers defended them, and did their best; an impartial and intelligent jury determined their fate; and by the voice of man, not of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, this number of human beings was <quote>legally</quote> sent out of existence!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3646"/>The leader of the insurrection &mdash; <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> &mdash; I knew well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3647"/>He was head man to a family intimate with mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>Implicit confidence was placed in him, not only by his master, but by the minister of the church and everybody who knew him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>He was some <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> old when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> planned the revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>His physical development was fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3651"/>He was muscular and active &mdash; the very man a sculptor would select for a model.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3652"/>And yet, with all his great <pb id="p.274" n="274"/>strength, he was kind and affectionate, and simple as a woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3653"/>He was never tired of doing for others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>In intellect he was richly gifted; no negro in the place could compare with him for clear-headedness and nobleness of will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>He was born to make a figure, and, with equal advantages, would have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> among any throng.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>He had character: that concentration of religious, moral, and mental strength, which, when possessed by high or low, gives man power over his fellows, and imparts life to his acts and name.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>His superiority was shown on the trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>It was necessary to prove that he was the leader, and counsel were about taking this step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/><quote>I am the man,</quote> said <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>There was no hesitation in his manner &mdash; no tremulousness in his voice; the words sounded naturally, but so clear and distinct that the court and audience knew it was so, and it could not have been otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>An effort was made to persuade him to have counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>His young masters pressed the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>The court urged him. Slaveholders were anxious for it, not only because they could not help liking his bearing, but because they wished to still every voice of censure, far or near, by having a fair trial for all. But he was resolute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>He made no set speeches &mdash; played no part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>Clear above all, and with the authoritative tone of truth, he repeated, <quote>I am the man, and I am not afraid or ashamed to confess it.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>Sentence of death was passed upon him and <num value="12">twelve</num> others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>The next step, before the last, was to ascertain all the negroes who had entered into the plot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> managed this part wisely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>He kept his own counsel, and, besides his brother, as was supposed, no <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.275" n="275"/>knew who had agreed to help him at home or from a distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>The testimony was abundant that he had promise of such help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>His declaration to the colored informer, <quote>The bonfire of the town will raise <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> armed men for us,</quote> was given in evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>He admitted the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/>But no ingenuity, no promises, no threats, could induce or force him to reveal a single name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/><quote>You have me,</quote> he said; <quote>no <num value="1">one</num> other shall you get if I can prevent it. The only pain I feel is that my life alone is not to be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>If these,</quote> pointing to his fellow captives, <quote>were safe, I should die triumphantly.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>The anxiety on this point naturally was very deep, and when the usual expedients had failed, the following scheme was hit upon: <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> loved his minister, as everybody did who worshipped at his altar, and the minister reciprocated heartily that love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/><quote><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> will not resist him &mdash; he will get out of <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> all that we want to know</quote> This was the general belief, and, acting upon it, a committee visited the pastor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3678"/>An explanation took place, and the good man readily consented to do all he could.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>He went to the cell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/></p> 
<p>I wish that I could repeat the tale as I heard the old minister tell it. So minute, yet so natural; so particular in detail, yet so life-like!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/>I have known sternest slaveholders to weep like children as they would listen to the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>But I can only narrate it as I remember it, in briefest outline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/><quote>I could not proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>I looked at <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>; my eye fell before his. I could not forget his rebuke; I acknowledged my sin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/></p> 
<p>A long silence ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>The minister was in hopes that <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> would break it; he did not. He himself made several attempts to do so, but failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/>Recovering from his shock at length, and reverting in his own mind to the horrors which the revolt would have occasioned, he resumed the conversation thus:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/><quote> But, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, yours was a wicked plot; and if you had succeeded, you would have made the very streets run blood.

<p><quote>Master,</quote> <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> quickly responded, <quote>I love old master and mistress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>I love you and yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>I would die to bless you any time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3705"/>Master, I would hurt no human being, no living thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>But you taught me that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of black as well as white &mdash; that he was no respecter of persons &mdash; that in his eye all were alike equal &mdash; and that there was no religion unless we loved him and our neighbor, and did unto others as we would they should do unto us. Master, I was a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3707"/>My wife and children were slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3708"/>If equal with others before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, they should be equal before men. I saw my young masters learning, holding what they made, and making what they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>But master, my race could make nothing, holding nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3710"/>What they did they did for others, not for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3711"/>And they had to do it, whether they wished it or not; for they were slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3712"/>Master, this is not loving our neighbor, or doing to others as we would have them do to us. I knew there was and could be no help for me, for wife or children, for my race, except we were free; and as the whites would not let this be so, and as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> told me he could only help those who helped themselves, I preached freedom to the slaves, and bid them strike for it like men. Master, we were betrayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3713"/>But I tell you now, if we had succeeded, I should have slain old master and mistress and you <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to show my people that I could sacrifice my love, as I ordered them to sacrifice their hates, to have justice &mdash; justice for them &mdash; justice for mine &mdash; justice for all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3714"/>I could not kill any human creature without being so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3715"/></p> 
<p><quote> I do n't know how it was,</quote> continued the old minister, <quote>but I was overpowered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> mastered me. It was not that his reasoning was conclusive; that, I could have answered easily; but my conduct had been so base and his honesty was so transparent, his look so earnest and sincere, his voice so commanding, that I forgot everything in my sympathy for him. He was a hero, and bore himself like <num value="1">one</num> without knowing it. I knew by that instinct which ever accompanies goodness, that the slave-felon's conscience was unstained by crime even in thought; and, grasping him by the hand, without scarce knowing what I was going to do, I said, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, let us pray.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>And I prayed long and earnestly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>I did not stop to think of my words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>My heart poured itself out and I was relieved.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3720"/></p>

<p><quote> What it ought to have been,</quote> energetically replied the old divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/><quote rend="blockquote">

<p>I prayed to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as our common Father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>I acknowledged that he would do justice; that it was hard for us, poor mortals, to say who was right and who was wrong on earth; that the very best were sinners, and those deemed the worst by us might be regarded the best by Him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>I prayed <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to forgive him, if wrong; to forgive the whites, if he was right; to forgive and bless all. I was choked with tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/>I caught hold of <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s hand and pressed it warmly, and received his warm pressure in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>And with a joy I never experienced before or <pb id="p.279" n="279"/>since, I heard his earnest, solemn <quote>Amen</quote> as I closed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/>We stood together for some time in silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> was deeply moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>I saw it by the working of his frame, and the muscles of his face and his eye. For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time tear-drops stood on his eyelids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>But, stilling every emotion, he began, as calmly as if he were going to rest:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/> <quote> Master, I shall die in peace, and I give you a dying man's blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>I shall see you no more on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you forever, master.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>We parted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>I saw him no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>I could not see him hung, or pray for him, as requested to do by others in the last dying hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>I had been with him long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>For <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> we were together in his narrow, noisome cell.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>The citizens outside awaited anxiously the good minister's egress from the jail, and, when he appeared, crowded round him to know the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>He looked like <num value="1">one</num> jaded with a long journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>He was worn down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/><quote>It is useless &mdash; it is useless &mdash; let him die in peace,</quote> was all he said; and, seeing that he was deeply moved, and taking it for granted that he had been engaged in devotional exercises with the dying, silence pervaded the group, and he was allowed to <pb id="p.280" n="280"/>depart in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>And never in public or in a mixed audience, would that minister refer to <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, or the hours he spent with him!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>No other effort to elicit information from the leader was made, and none who promised him help were discovered through him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>The death-day came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>A mighty crowd gathered to witness the sad event to which, in that place, it was to be devoted; and the military, with gleaming swords and bright bayonets, stood under the gallows, to guard against escape or difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/><num value="6">Six</num> <quote>felons</quote> were upon the gallows &mdash; it could hold no more &mdash; and <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> was put on the list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/><quote>Be men,</quote> said he, when <num value="1">one</num> of the number showed some timidity, <quote>and die like men. I'll give you an example: then, obey my brother.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>That brother stood next him. <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> gazed intently upon the crowd &mdash; some thought he was looking for his wife and children &mdash; and then spoke his farewell to his young masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>A few words passed between him and his brother, when, saying audibly, <quote>I'll die a freeman,</quote> he sprung up as high as he could, and fell heavily as the knotted rope checked his fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>Instantly his frame was convulsed, and, in its muscular action, his feet reached the plank on which he had stood, looking as if he sought to regain it. His brother, turning his face to his comrades, deliberately put his hand upon his side, and, leaning forward, held the body clear with his elbow, as he said: <quote>Let us die like him.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>The authorities perceived that the terrors of the law would be lost, and none of <quote>the good</quote> they anticipated be secured among the blacks, especially, who filled up the outer circle of the dense crowd, if this lofty heroism were witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/>They proceeded <pb id="p.281" n="281"/>rapidly with the execution, and, in a few moments, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> and his brother and their felon comrades were asleep together.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/>The bodies of the blacks, after dangling in the air the usual time, as if in mockery of heaven and earth, were cut down, coffined, and carted away to their burial-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>That was an out-of-the-way old field, with a stagnant lagoon on <num value="3">three</num> sides of it, and a barren sand-waste, covered with a sparse growth of short pines, on the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>Beneath the shade of <num value="1">one</num> of these pines which skirted the field, and not far off from the felons' graves, a colored woman and a cluster of little ones might have been seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3760"/>These were <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s wife and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>They stood where they were, until all, save <num value="1">one</num> white man, had departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>He made a signal, and they approached the burial spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3763"/>He pointed to a particular spot, and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3764"/>None know, save our Father, how long the widowed <num value="1">one</num> and the fatherless remained there, or what were their emotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3765"/>But, next morning, a rough stake was found driven into the earth where <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> lay, and, ere the next Sabbath dawned, a pile of stones with an upright memorial, was placed at the head of his grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3766"/>How these stones were obtained &mdash; for none like them were to be seen within <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>--no <num value="1">one</num> could say, though all knew <hi rend="italics">who</hi> put them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3767"/>The rude memorial still stands!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3768"/>The grave of <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> is yet known!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>And that widowed <num value="1">one</num>, while she lived &mdash; for she, too, has departed &mdash; kept the lone burial spot free from weeds, and covered it with the wild rose, as if the spirit which had once animated the cold clay beneath, loved a robe of beauty and sweetness!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3770"/><pb id="p.282" n="282"/></p> 
<p>As not the least remarkable feature in <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s conduct, was the course he pursued towards his family, we cannot close without referring to it. He was an exemplary husband, and a wise as well as kind father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3771"/>His wife was not superior, intellectually, but she was affectionate, and he so moulded her character as to make her worthy of him. His children were well-behaved, and remarkable for their polite manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3772"/>His very household gave evidence of all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3773"/>Everything was in order; the furniture was neat; in all the arrangements he had an intelligent eye to comfort and taste; he had a watch, and some tolerable Scripture engravings; and his little garden was well stocked with the best vegetables, the best fruit, and the rarest flowers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3774"/>Of the plot, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s wife knew nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3775"/>He had evidently thought of his failure, and committed no women, and as few married men as he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3776"/>He meant, let what might happen to him, that his partner should suffer no harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3777"/>This was evident enough from his conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3778"/>For, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing he did after his arrest, was to desire an interview with his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3779"/>That was denied him. Not that the old gentleman was cruel or angry &mdash; for he loved <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> &mdash; but because, as he said, <quote>He could not stand it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3780"/>The next thing was to send for his young master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3781"/>He came, and to him he said: <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Massa</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName></persName>, I have sent for you to say, that my wife does not know anything about the insurrection, or any of my action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3782"/>I wanted to see old master to beg of him not to sell or separate her and the children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3783"/>I must get you to do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3784"/>And, <persName><roleName n="Massa">Massa</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName></persName>, when your father dies, I want you to promise that you will help them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3785"/>The young man promised (and we rejoice to say his word was kept), <pb id="p.283" n="283"/>and then <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, the slave and the felon, blessed him. Never again, until near his last hour, when conversing with his minister, did he refer to his family, and the only message he sent them was a torn Bible, with this sentence rudely writ down on <num value="1">one</num> of the leaves: <quote>We shall live again, and be together.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3786"/>So deep was his affection for his family, and so careful was he to ward off every suspicion from them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3787"/>I met, last summer, the slaveholder &mdash; an intelligent and humane man &mdash; who commanded the military the day <rs>Isaac</rs> was hung.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3788"/>I referred to the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3789"/>He spoke of it as <num value="1">one</num> of the most moving that he had ever witnessed, and to my surprise, though very much to my gratification, remarked:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3790"/><quote> I never knew what true heroism was until I saw <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> manifest it upon his seizure, trial and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3791"/>I felt my inferiority to him in every way, and I never think of him without ranking him among the best and bravest men that ever lived.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3792"/></p> 
<p>The record below tells of his crime, and he will be remembered on earth as a felon; but the record above will contain his virtues, and in heaven the good will know and love him &mdash; for <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> was a man. <pb id="p.284" n="284"/></p></div3></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3795"/>the thriving condition of the <orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">Underground Railroad</orgName>, establishes conclusively the existence of secret and rapid modes of communication among the slave population of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3796"/>Many extraordinary stories are told by the <name>Southrons</name> themselves of the facility with which the negroes learn of all events that transpire in the surrounding country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/>In spite of strict surveillance on the plantation, and careful watching abroad, by means of numerous and well mounted patrols, the slaves pass freely over large tracts of country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/>More especially does this state of things exist among the plantations of the cotton growing States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3799"/>The dense forests, swamps and morasses, which the negroes alone can tread with impunity, enable them to avoid the highways and beaten paths wherein they would be likely to meet the patrol.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3800"/>This system of secret travel originally grew out of the social desires of the slaves &mdash; their love of gossip and wish to meet their friends and relatives; but, as the tyranny of the system grew more insupportable, in the natural course of events, and the yearnings after freedom became stronger in the minds of the negroes themselves, it was used for other and far <pb id="p.285" n="285"/>more dangerous purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>The preceding chapter will show how an earnest man can use this power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3802"/>I remember an incident narrated to me at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, which illustrates this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3803"/>In conversation upon various subjects with <rs type="role">Col.</rs>----, a fine specimen of the <rs>Southern</rs> planter, with whom I had formed a slight acquaintance, various traits and peculiarities of the negro character were alluded to; and, among others, the extraordinary facilities possessed by the slaves in communicating with each other.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>Col----. said it was impossible to prevent it. No matter how rigid the laws might be, or how strictly they were enforced, the <hi rend="italics">evil</hi> (as he called it) still continued to grow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/></p> 
<p>Several summers since, I was in the interior of the <rs>State</rs>, visiting the plantation of a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>While there, <num value="1">one</num> morning, the news arrived of a dreadful murder that had been committed, a short distance from the estate, by a poor white man who kept a small grocery at the cross roads near the boundary of several estates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/>He was supposed to be a receiver of the various articles which plantation slaves are in the habit of stealing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3809"/>In a fit of insane jealousy, he had brutally murdered a woman who lived with him as his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3810"/>He had immediately decamped, and was supposed to have gone in the direction of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3811"/>I was about returning to my home; and my friend, an active magistrate, proposed that we should endeavor to overtake the murderer; or, by reaching the city at an early hour, cause his arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3812"/>The distance was about <measure n="80miles" type="distance">eighty miles</measure>, and we did not start till late in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3813"/>We rode rapidly, changing our horses twice, and about <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.286" n="286"/>o'clock in the morning, reached the banks of the river a few miles from the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3814"/>My companion had alluded, during the ride, to the knowledge that our servants were generally possessed of all intelligence, and offered to bet any amount of money that <quote> Old Harry</quote> (the black ferryman), already knew everything about the murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3815"/>I was incredulous; for we had ridden fast, and, by no possibility, did it seem to me, could he have learnt anything relating to the tragedy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3822"/> We both expressed our ignorance of the event, and old <persName><foreName>Harry</foreName></persName>, after some hesitation, gave us the particulars very accurately, stating that he had heard of it that night from a plantation hand.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3823"/> Here was an extraordinary proof of what my companion had stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>We had travelled rapidly; no <num value="1">one</num> had left the neighborhood before us; yet this old man had learnt of the event some hours previous to our arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>It had been passed from plantation to plantation, and thus it had reached him.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3826"/>I listened to the story, and treasured up its facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>It seems to me that here lies a power, by means of which a formidable insurrection, directed by white men, can safely be formed and consummated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3936"/>The poor creature writhed and shrieked, and, in a voice which showed alike her fear of death and her dreadful agony, screamed to her master, who stood at her head, <quote>Oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3937"/>Spare my life.--do n't cut my soul out!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3938"/>But still fell the horrid lash; still strip after strip was broken from the skin; gash after gash was cut in her flesh, until it became a livid and bloody mass of raw and quivering muscle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3939"/>It was with the greatest difficulty that I refrained from springing upon the torturer and arresting his lash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3940"/>But, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3941"/>what could I do but turn aside, to hide my tears for the sufferer, and my blushes for humanity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3942"/>This was in a public and regularly organized prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3943"/>The punishment was <num value="1">one</num> recognized and authorized by the law. But, think you, the poor wretch had <pb id="p.298" n="298"/>committed a heinous offence, and been convicted thereof, and sentenced to the lash?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3944"/>Not at all!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3945"/>She was brought by her master to be whipped by the common executioner, without trial, judge, or jury, to gratify his own whim or malice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3946"/>And he may bring her day after day, without cause assigned, and inflict any number of lashes he pleases, short of <num value="25">twenty-five</num>, provided only he pays the fee. Or, if he choose, he may have a private whipping-board on his own premises and brutalize himself there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3947"/>A shocking part of this horrid punishment was its publicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3948"/>As I have said, it was in a courtyard, surrounded by galleries, which were filled with colored persons of all sexes: runaway slaves; slaves committed for some crime, or slaves up for sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3949"/>You would naturally suppose they crowded forward, and gazed, horror-stricken, at the brutal spectacle below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3950"/>But they did not; many of them hardly noticed it; and some were entirely indifferent to it. They went on in their childish pursuits, and some were laughing outright in the distant parts of the galleries!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3951"/>So low can man, created in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> image, be sunk in brutality!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3952"/>So much is he the creature of circumstance, that, by a degrading and brutalizing system of slavery, every distinguishing trait of humanity may be effaced, and he be made happy as the stalled ox; while a Christian and civilized people can be found, who, from the mere love of lucre, will fasten their system, and urge, in their defence, that he is as happy as a brute, and is incapable of any higher enjoyment.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3955"/>the reader must have noticed that I took particular pains to ascertain the secret sentiments of the <rs>Southern</rs> slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3956"/>He must have seen, also, that I never stepped aside to collate or investigate any cases of unusual cruelty, or to portray the neglect of masters in the different States, to provide their bondmen with the comforts of a home or the decencies of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3957"/>That I had material enough, my summary will show.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3958"/>I did not go South to collect the materials for a distant war of words against it. Far more earnest was my aim.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3959"/>I saw or believed that <num value="1">one</num> cycle of anti-slavery warfare was about to close &mdash; the cycle whose correspondences in history are the eras of John Ball, the herald of the brave <rs>Jack Cade</rs>; of the <rs>Humble Remonstrants</rs> who preceded <persName n="Cromwell,,Oliver,,," id="n0060.0007.00299.00348" reg="default:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><foreName>Oliver</foreName> <surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, and the <rs>Iconoclastic Puritans</rs>; and of the <name>Encyclopaedists</name> of the age of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> the <genName n="16">Sixteenth</genName></persName>, whose writings prepared the way for the <rs>French Revolution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3960"/>I believed that the cycle of action was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3961"/>I considered it, therefore, of importance to know the feelings and aspirations of the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3962"/>I cared little, comparatively with this object, to ascertain their <pb id="p.300" n="300"/>physical condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3963"/>I never even read a book on the subject &mdash; a volume of fiction alone excepted &mdash; until the manuscripts of the preceding pages were placed in the hands of the printer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3964"/>I knew that irrepressible power must, from its very nature, corrupt men, and make them cruel, heartless, and licentious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3965"/>It would have been useless to travel South to corroborate that truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3966"/>My object was to aid the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3967"/>If I found that slavery had so far degraded them, that they were comparatively contented with their debased condition, I resolved, before I started, to spend my time in the <rs>South</rs>, in disseminating discontentment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3968"/>But if, on the other hand, I found them ripe for a rebellion, my resolution was to prepare the way for it, as far as my ability and opportunities permitted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3969"/>I believed that a civil war between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> would ultimate in insurrection, and that the <rs>Kansas</rs> troubles would probably create a military conflict of the sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>Hence I left the <rs>South</rs>, and went to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>; and endeavored, personally and by my pen, to precipitate a revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3971"/>That we failed &mdash; for I was not alone in this desire &mdash; was owing to the influence of prominent Republican statesmen, whose unfortunately conservative character of counsel &mdash; which it was impossible openly to resist-effectually baffled all our hopes: hopes which Democratic action was auspiciously promoting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3972"/>Are we, then, without hope?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3973"/>No! and, while slaves live, and the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of justice is omnipotent, never will we be discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3974"/>Revolutions never go backward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3975"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> American Revolution has begun.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3977"/>It is fashionable for our animalcule-statesmen to lament or affirm that slavery cannot speedily be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3978"/>It is so wrought and interwoven with the social system of the <rs>South</rs>--with its commercial, political, and religious organizations &mdash; that to root it out at once, they maintain, would be disastrous to the country and to the slave himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/>Perish the country, then, and woe to the slave!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>Whatever falls, let slavery perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3981"/>Whoever suffers, let slavery end. If the <rs>Union</rs> is to be the price of a <hi rend="italics">crime</hi>, let us repent of the iniquity and destroy the bond.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>It is subjoined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>I reported her own language, as she replied to my questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4109"/>This, then, is a picture of slavery in its most pleasing aspects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/>Of many of the facts she relates I have personal knowledge; and her character for veracity is vouched for by every <num value="1">one</num> who knows her.</p>
