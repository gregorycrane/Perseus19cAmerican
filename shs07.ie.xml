<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>His district embraced the territory bounded north by the <rs>Potomac</rs>, east by the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, and west by <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Born and reared in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and filled with a patriot's devotion to the land of his birth, he had manifested a strong desire to be employed in the operations in that region, and had cherished the ambition of freeing his former home from hostile domination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The Confederates, during the summer, had in that region been unsuccessful.

In this way he could turn the left flank of the enemy's forces, place himself on their communications, and force them to evacuate or fight under circumstances of his own selection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Having seen how his predecessors had been hampered in trying to operate from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> westward, by the difficult and inaccessible nature of the country, composed almost entirely of mountains destitute of supplies, and penetrated by nothing but indifferent wagon roads, he was anxious to try a mode of approach which, if more exposed to the enemy, had the advantage of being easier, of lying through a much more populous and cultivated region, of affording to some extent the use of a railroad for supplies, and which would soon place him in the midst of some of the most fertile parts of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In order to carry out this scheme he asked for his old brigade, which had been left at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and that all the forces operating along the line of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName> southwest of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and lately commanded by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0002.00003.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:82"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, should be concentrated under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This would have given him <num value="15000">15,000</num> or <num value="16000">16,000</num> men, the least force with which he thought it possible to undertake so bold an enterprise.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>On the previous evening the enemy, who had advanced as far as <placeName reg="Silver Run, Hoke, North Carolina" key="tgn,2664121">Silver run</placeName>, were reported by the cavalry to have retired a distance of <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> below that point, and our troops had received orders from the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> commanding to remain in camp for the day and rest after their fatiguing marches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>About <time value="8am">8 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>I threw forward a strong skirmish line a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in front of this position, and ordered up some of my field pieces to support the main line &mdash; my object being only to check temporarily the advance of the enemy until our baggage trains should be beyond the reach of danger, when I designed to retire <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Rhett,,,,," id="n0120.0003.00031.00591" reg="mostcommon:Rhett,nomatch:0"><surname>Rhett</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> upon <persName n="Elliott,,,,," id="n0120.0003.00031.00592" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,Stephen,,,"><surname>Elliott</surname></persName>'s.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/><pb id="p.32" n="32"/></p> 
<p>I threw a few shells into the woods in front of my skirmish line, but except an occasional slight demonstration along that line, nothing of consequence occurred during the rest of this day.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Our skirmishers, under the command of <persName n="Hugenin,Captain,,,," id="n0120.0003.00032.00599" reg="mostcommon:Hugenin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hugenin</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="1SCInfantry">First South Carolina infantry</orgName>, received the advance very handsomely, and retired with coolness, contesting the ground well, to the main line.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>The enemy now established batteries over a rising ground beyond the swamp in our front to the left of the main road, and shelled our lines with great determination and vigor, and made several successive attempts upon our lines with their infantry, chiefly pushing our left &mdash; in all of which they were met with a gallant resistance, and were repulsed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>About <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> he severely pressed our left and threatened to turn it; at the same time he massed additional troops, extending his line to our right, finally lapping and turning it, when, in consequence of the heavy attack, and the impossibility of extending our line, already deployed to its fullest extent, I directed the troops to be withdrawn to the line held by <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Elliott,,,,," id="n0120.0003.00032.00601" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,Stephen,,,"><surname>Elliott</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, which was accomplished, <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>under the circumstances, with remarkable coolness and with little loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>The fighting was severe during the entire morning, and men, as well as officers, displayed signal gallantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Our loss was heavy, including some of our best officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>The light pieces used by me here consisted of <num value="2">two</num> <num value="12">twelve</num>-pound howitzers, of Le <placeName reg="Garden's New Orleans battery">Garden's New Orleans battery</placeName>, and <num value="1">one</num> <num value="12">twelve</num>-pound <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0120.0003.00033.00602" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, of <orgName n="SC artillery"><persName n="Stewart,,,,," id="n0120.0003.00033.00603" reg="mostcommon:Stewart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stewart</surname></persName>'s South Carolina artillery</orgName>, which were admirably served, and which operated with decided result upon the enemy's infantry and opposing battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The ground was so soft from the heavy rains that it was with difficulty the pieces could be manoeuvred, while the concentrated fire upon them was terrible &mdash; nearly every cannoneer of both sections being killed or wounded, while <num value="9">nine</num> of Le Garden's and every horse of <persName n="Stewart,,,,," id="n0120.0003.00033.00604" reg="mostcommon:Stewart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stewart</surname></persName>'s, except <num value="1">one</num>, were killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Spare horses had been ordered from the rear, but did not arrive before it was found necessary to withdraw from the line; and the roads being so deep and heavy from the rains and the passage of baggage trains, they could not be withdrawn by hand &mdash; so that <num value="2">two</num> of the guns had to be abandoned &mdash; not, however, until all the ammunition to the last shell had been expended upon the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>After this the enemy made several demonstrations along the new line now held by my division, attacking with considerable determination, but were always handsomely and successfully resisted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>About <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> it was ascertained that the enemy was moving a large force to our left, in the direction of <placeName reg="Smiths, Robeson, North Carolina" key="tgn,2672126">Black river</placeName>, which his immense superiority in numbers enabled him to do without much weakening his lines in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>To meet this demonstration, I determined to move my division back to the main line selected by <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0120.0003.00033.00607" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,W.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName>, which was done with no difficulty and little loss, where I was directed to hold that part of the line which lay on the right and left of the main road, the <orgName>division of <persName n="McLaws,Major-General,,,," id="n0120.0003.00033.00608" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,Lafayette,,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName></orgName> connecting with me on the left, and <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Wheeler,Major-General,,,," id="n0120.0003.00033.00609" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>, dismounted, on my right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The enemy shelled this new position at intervals during the day, and assailed it with infantry several times unsuccessfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Their artillery fire was returned by my pieces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Heavy skirmishing continued along my line until <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> at night, when my troops were withdrawn and resumed the march with the main body of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0120.0003.00033.00610" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,W.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, leaving General <pb id="p.34" n="34"/><orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n0120.0003.00034.00611" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> (dismounted) temporarily occupying our abandoned works as their skirmish line until near day break.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The officers and men of my command fought admirably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Although unaccustomed to field fighting, they behaved as well as any troops could have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>The discipline of garrison service, and of regular organizations, as well as their daily exposure for <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> past to the <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> of the enemy, told in the coolness and determination with which they received and returned the heavy fire of this day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>I immediately placed a section of some battery, either <persName n="Bankhead,,,,," id="n0120.0004.00043.00737" reg="nearbymention:Bankhead,Smith,P.,,"><surname>Bankhead</surname></persName>'s or <placeName key="tgn,2041436" n="1.000 16" reg="stanford, lincoln, kentucky">Stanford</placeName>'s, I do not recollect which, in position, and was on the point of bringing more guns in position when, suggesting the propriety of endeavoring to throw in the gap between the right of our line and the left of the adjoining infantry as large an infantry force as we could obtain, I was directed to ride to the rear and bring up the debris of several disorganized infantry regiments; and other officers <pb id="p.44" n="44"/>of the staff, under your personal direction and supervision, collected all the guns of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> batteries along the position referred to, on the crest of the hills overlooking the field, and when I returned to rejoin you, after an unsuccessful attempt to forward the men referred to, I found the enemy, being unable to withstand the destructive cannonade which you had directed against them, had fallen back rapidly through the field over the hills beyond, where, finding themselves cut off by portions of our division, and being threatened on the flank by <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n0120.0004.00044.00738" reg="nearbymention:Polk,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>, they threw down their arms.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Being a larger brigade, it produced more impression; but its advance exposed its right flank to a deadly tire from the troops south of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>This checked its progress and inflicted upon it great loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>I soon had occasion to learn, too, that heavy masses were pressing by and beyond its left.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>The open ground in front sloped gradually downward for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>, and then, by an abrupt declivity, it descended to a narrow swamp or morass, which, beginning near the <placeName reg="Plank, Tioga, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2092056">Plank</placeName> road, extended northward in a direction nearly parallel to my line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Beyond the morass the ground rose with a moderately steep ascent for several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, and was covered with trees and a scattering undergrowth.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>At the command the men moved forward with alacrity, and with increasing speed, to the brow of the steep declivity referred to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>My front rank fired a volley without halting, and the whole line bounded forward with their characteristic yell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>The enemy were <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>evidently taken by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>The suddenness of our appearance on the crest, the volley, the yell and the impetuous advance caused them to forget their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>While descending the slope, and just before the occurrence mentioned, I became aware, from the direction of the balls which passed, that a force of the enemy had crossed the morass, ascended the heights and occupied a body of woods at the farther limit of the open ground, <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> or more beyond my extreme left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>The order had been received amidst the indescribable clangor of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>The attention of a line of men over <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> long had been gained; they had been wheeled through an arc of at least <num value="60">sixty</num> degrees, had traversed the intervening open ground, had entered the woods at a charge and were driving its occupants &mdash; more than twice their number &mdash; in the wildest confusion before them; and but little more than <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> had elapsed since the giving of the order!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Many of the men were leaving the ranks and taking shelter behind the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>The fire was severe, but the enemy, being a little back of the crest of the hill, sent most of their balls over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The conduct of the officers and men had been above all praise; but fortune had been very lavish in her favors to us.

The consequence was that the men were all in good humor, and as my division halted a considerable time, the men roamed over the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>While sitting on my horse near a large brick building called the <rs>Washington Bank</rs> (I think that was the name) <persName n="Lamar,Captain,G.,B.,," id="n0120.0007.00065.00972" reg="default:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName>, my aid-de-camp, rode up and informed me that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag was being waved from the upper story of the bank building, and as there were a good many men of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00065.00973" reg="mostcommon:Hood,John,B.,,:3"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s and my division <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>in town who were under the influence of liquor, he was apprehensive that some insult might be offered to the family within the the house unless the flag was withdrawn before I left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>I therefore directed him to knock at the front door and tell some responsible person within of the circumstance and give them my request that the flag be withdrawn, at least until the command had passed on. <persName n="Lamar,Captain,,,," id="n0120.0007.00066.00974" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName> did as directed, and afterwards told me that the lady of the house had answered his knock, and on being told his reason for coming, turned very pale, and, clasping her hands, assured him that the flag was being displayed by some young persons without her knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>This reminds me of an incident that happened while on the march through <placeName reg="Frederick City">Frederick City</placeName> on our previous campaign of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>The General, a gallant gentleman as he was, with the ladies as in war, pulled off his hat and bowed to them with great courtesy, his men cheering in unison; but presently the cheering was succeeded by a burst of laughter from the rear, and as the <rs>General</rs> turned to find out the cause, the men shouted, <quote>Why, General, those are Federal flags!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>The General, not at all disconcerted, replied at once: <quote>Never mind, boys, that is not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I have pulled off my hat to that flag!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>and the men cheered more than before, and the column went on in the best of humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>I mention this to show with what little unworthy and ungenerous feeling our men went into the invasion, and scorned to give offense or insult where it could not be resented.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>My division finally went through <placeName key="tgn,2087107" n="1.000 167" reg="chambersburg, franklin, pennsylvania">Chambersburg</placeName> and into camp about a mile beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>The country was thickly settled and finely cultivated, with some excellent gardens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>I recollect <num value="1">one</num> near my headquarters which abounded with vegetables, and the sight was so tantalizing that finally a party of my command came and asked if I would not negotiate for some of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Accordingly, I paid a formal visit to the lady of the mansion, where the garden was, and telling her the purpose of my visit asked if she would sell some or all her vegetables-informing her, however, that we had but Confederate money wherewith to pay, but if she preferred it I would give her a certificate of what was <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>She replied that from what she had heard of the way the <rs>Federal</rs> troops treated our people she thought we had a right to take without asking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>I told her that, without discussing that question, it was sufficient to say that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0007.00067.00977" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:82"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had forbidden us to plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>She then said that she gave her permission for us to take anything we wanted, and at my request she went herself and gave her vegetables away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>As the train appeared to be a very long <num value="1">one</num> I had its rate of travel timed as it passed over a known distance, and computed its length to be over <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>At any rate it was not until after <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> that it had passed, and I then took up the line of march to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>The march was continued, and about <time value="10pm">ten P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>I then went back to the head of my column and sat on my horse and saw in the distance the enemy coming, hour after hour, on to the battle ground.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>At length &mdash; my recollection is that it was about <time value="1pm">1 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>My command was at once put in motion--<persName n="Johnston,Major,,,," id="n0120.0007.00069.01012" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:13"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and myself riding some distance ahead Suddenly, as we rose a hill on the road we were taking, the <rs>Round Top</rs> was plainly visible, with the flags of the signal men in rapid motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>I sent back and halted my division and rode with <persName n="Johnston,Major,,,," id="n0120.0007.00069.01013" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:13"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> rapidly around the neighborhood to see if there was any road by which we could go into position without being seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Not finding any I joined my command and met <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0120.0007.00069.01014" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> there, who asked, <quote>What is the matter?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>I replied, <quote>Ride with me and I will show you that we can't go on this route, according to instructions, without being seen by the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>We rode to the top of the hill and he at once said, <quote>Why this won't do. Is there no way to avoid it?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>I then told him of my reconnoissance in the morning, and he said: <quote>How can we get there?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>I said: <quote>Only by going back &mdash; by countermarching.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>He said: <quote>Then all right,</quote> and the movement commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>But as <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0120.0007.00069.01015" reg="mostcommon:Hood,John,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, in his eagerness for the fray (and he bears the character of always being so), had pressed on his division behind mine so that it lapped considerably, creating confusion in the countermarch, <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0120.0007.00069.01016" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> rode to me and said: <quote>General, there is so much confusion, owing to <orgName n="division"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00069.01017" reg="mostcommon:Hood,John,B.,,:3"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> being mixed up with yours, suppose you let him countermarch <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and lead in the attack.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>I replied: <quote>General, as I started in the lead, let me continue so;</quote> and he replied, <quote>Then go on,</quote> and rode off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>After very considerable difficulty, owing to the rough character of the country in places and the fences and ditches we had to cross, the countermarch was effected, and my troops were moving easily forward along a road with fences on the side not giving room enough for a company front, making it necessary to break files to the rear, when <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0120.0007.00069.01018" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> rode up to me, and said: <quote>How are you going in?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>and I replied, <quote>That will be determined when I can see what is in my front.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>He said: <quote>There is nothing in your <pb id="p.70" n="70"/>front; you will be entirely on the flank of the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>I replied, <quote>Then I will continue my march in columns of companies, and after arriving on the flank as far as is necessary will face to the left and march on the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>He replied, <quote>That suits me,</quote> and rode away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>My head of column soon reached the edge of the woods, and the enemy at once opened on it with numerous artillery, and <num value="1">one</num> rapid glance showed them to be in force much greater than I had, and extending considerably beyond my right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>My command, therefore, instead of marching on as directed, by head of column, deployed at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/><persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00070.01019" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,P.,M.,,:1"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>, a very cool, judicious and gallant gentleman, immediately turned the head of his column and marched by flank to right, and put his men under cover of a stone wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/><persName n="Barksdale,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00070.01020" reg="mostcommon:Barksdale,nomatch:0"><surname>Barksdale</surname></persName>, the fiery, impetuous Mississippian, following, came into line on the left of <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00070.01021" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,P.,M.,,:1"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>, his men sheltered by trees and part of a stone wall and under a gentle declivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Besides the artillery firing, the enemy were advancing a strong line of skirmishers and threatening an advance in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>I hurried back to quicken the march of those in rear, and sent orders for my artillery to move to my right and open fire, so as to draw the fire of the opposite artillery from my infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>I will here state that I had in my division about <num value="6000">six thousand</num>, aggregate &mdash; which, I think, is over the mark.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>Well, <num value="6000">six thousand</num> men standing in line would occupy over a mile, and in marching in the manner and over the roads we came they would extend a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>So you will perceive that to form line of battle by directing troops across the country broken by fences and ditches requires considerable time, and it was difficult, from the same causes, to get the artillery in position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>And when the numerous guns opened, shaking the very earth between the opposing armies, the shot and shell from the batteries on our right poured over my command: those of the enemy crossing ours, going in opposite directions, but all bent on the same mission of destruction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>The enemy appeared to be waiting the assault to follow the storm of shot and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>Of course there was not a soldier in either army of any experience who did not know that an assault was to be made somewhere, and the shells, as they bursted over the enemy's lines, gave of themselves a pretty sure indication to them that it was on their centre that the shock was to be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>I immediately ordered forward my brigade against the strong position of the enemy, on a range of mountains, distant a mile or a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, and separated from us by open plains, intersected by numerous post and rail fences, farm houses and barns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>This ground was swept by the enemy's artillery posted along the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road and on the crest of the heights on <placeName reg="McPherson's farm">McPherson's farm</placeName>, a little south of <placeName key="tgn,2230256" n="1.000 81" reg="cemetery hill, adams, pennsylvania">Cemetery Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>My men moved forward until reaching within musket range of the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road, where we encountered a strong body of infantry, posted under cover of the fences parallel with that road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>Just in rear of this line was the advanced batteries of the enemy, raking the whole field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>Just before reaching this position I had observed that <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Posey,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00085.01229" reg="mostcommon:Posey,nomatch:0"><surname>Posey</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> on my left had not advanced, and fearing that if I proceeded much further with my left flank entirely unprotected that I might become involved in serious difficulties, I dispatched my aid-de-camp, <persName n="Bell,Captain,,,," id="n0120.0007.00085.01230" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName>, with a message to <persName n="Anderson,Major-General,,,," id="n0120.0007.00085.01231" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:7"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>I immediately charged upon the enemy and drove him in great confusion upon a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, formed behind a stone fence, some <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in rear of the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>Having gained the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road, we again charged upon the enemy posted behind the stone fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>Here the enemy made considerable resistance, but were finally forced to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>We were now within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the crest of the heights, which were lined with artillery, supported by a strong body of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>My men, by a well directed fire, shoot down the cannoneers from <pb id="p.86" n="86"/>their guns, and leaping the stone fence charge up to the top of the crest, and drive the enemy's infantry into a rocky gorge on the eastern slope of the heights, some <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in rear of the enemy's batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>We were now complete masters of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>Just as we had carried the enemy's last and strongest position, it was discovered that the brigade on our right (<persName n="Perry,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00086.01233" reg="mostcommon:Perry,William,F.,,:2"><surname>Perry</surname></persName>'s) had not advanced across the turnpike, but had actually given away, and was rapidly falling back to the rear, while on our left we were entirely unsupported &mdash; the brigade (<persName n="Posey,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00086.01234" reg="mostcommon:Posey,nomatch:0"><surname>Posey</surname></persName>'s) ordered to our support having failed to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>My advanced position and the unprotected condition of my flanks invited an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>The enemy immediately passed a heavy body of infantry &mdash; under cover of a high ledge of rocks and stunted undergrowth &mdash; from the gorge, and emerging from the ridge upon my right, equi-distant from the stone fence and the <rs type="place">Emmettsburg turnpike</rs>; while a large brigade advanced from the woods on our left, and, gaining the turnpike, moved rapidly along that road to meet the force upon my right and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>The enemy's converging lines were rapidly closing upon our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>No supports could be seen coming to our assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>With painful hearts we abandoned our captured guns, prepared to cut our way through the closing lines in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>This was effected in tolerable order, but with immense loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>The enemy rushed to his abandoned guns as soon as we began to retire, and poured a severe fire of grape and cannister into our thinned ranks as we slowly retired down the slope and into the valley below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>I continued to fall back until I reached a slight depression, a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in advance of our line of the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>Finding that the enemy was not disposed to advance, a line of skirmishers was thrown out, and a little after dark my command moved to the position taken in the morning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>I have not the slightest doubt but that I should have been able to have maintained my position on the heights and secured the captured artillery if there had been a protecting force on my left, or if the brigade on my right had not been forced to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>We captured over <num value="20">twenty</num> pieces of artillery, which we were compelled to abandon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>Of our <num value="1600">sixteen hundred</num> and odd that went into the fight, <num value="554">five hundred and fifty-four</num> were all that answered afterwards &mdash; over <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men of a small brigade killed, wounded or captured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>I do not recollect an instance in ancient or modern warfare where so small a body of troops, entirely unsupported, as this brigade was, has accomplished so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>Charging through an open field for more than a mile; attacking a superior force posted on a mountain; climbing the side of the mountain; driving the enemy from behind a stone wall; shooting the gunners and capturing the cannon; then, when surrounded, litterally cutting their way out; retiring in good order, preventing the enemy from pursuing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>Although I knew their character, <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>well knew they were capable of doing what any other troops dare do, I was surprised at the vigor of their attack, and the tenacity with which they held their ground. * * * </p><closer><signed><persName n="Wright,,A.,R.,," id="n0120.0007.00087.01236" reg="default:Wright,A.,R.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName>  <surname>Wright</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</rs>, etc.</signed></closer></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>But to continue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>As I have stated previously, the enemy did not pursue <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00087.01238" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,George,E.,,"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>If they had, I would have at once called to arms and prepared to act as the emergency called for &mdash; either attack the advance against <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00087.01239" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,George,E.,,"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>, or, if the whole line of the enemy advanced, would have retired to my position of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, before the charge, and defended that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>The enemy did not pursue, because perhaps of the presence in their front of the tremendous artillery fire that would have been concentrated on their advance, and more probably because of the presence on their immediate flank of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0120.0007.00087.01240" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s <num value="2">two</num> divisions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>Sir &mdash; I avail myself of the earliest opportunity to inform you of the circumstances which have delayed my departure from this port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>The <rs>Caledonia</rs> crossed the bar at <placeName key="tgn,7014631" n="1.000 5" reg="wilmington, new hanover, north carolina">Wilmington</placeName> about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, the <dateStruct value="-03-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>With the exception of that night and the succeeding day, we had fine weather, but the speed of the vessel was so much less than had been anticipated that we did not reach this island until <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. The <rs>Caledonia</rs>, in a rough sea, with no more cargo than a few days' coal, would not average more than <num value="4">four</num> knots and <num value="0.5">a half</num> an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>I ascertained, after her arrival here, that the unloading of her cargo, taking on coal for <placeName reg="Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,7013046">Halifax</placeName>, and some repairs, would detain her until about the <dateStruct value="-03-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and that the <rs>British</rs> mail steamer for <placeName reg="Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,7013046">Halifax</placeName> would leave here on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>I thought that as under the most favorable circumstances I could only save a day or <num value="2">two</num> of time, and in all probability would lose it during the voyage by taking the <rs>Caledonia</rs>, it would be best to save the <rs>Government</rs> the heavy expense and hazard of my trip in that vessel, and to take my passage for next Friday in the <rs>Alpha</rs>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>Sir &mdash; In the communication which I had the honor to transmit from <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName>, I explained the reasons which induced me to turn the <rs>Caledonia</rs> over to her owners, and to engage my passage to <placeName reg="Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,7013046">Halifax</placeName> in the <rs>British</rs> mail <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Alpha</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>From what has since <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>transpired, it is certain that if I had escaped capture upon the <rs>Caledonia</rs>, there would have been no saving of time at all commensurate with the heavy expense to the <rs>Government</rs> which the employment of that vessel would have involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>The <rs>Alpha</rs> did not reach this port until the <dateStruct value="-03-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, having been delayed for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> by a severe storm which it encountered soon after leaving the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>Upon my arrival I learned that the prisoners, whose delivery had been demanded by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> under the extradition treaty, had been released by the judicial authorities of <placeName reg="New Brunswick" key="tgn,7005799">New Brunswick</placeName> upon habeas corpus; and although new warrants are out for their arrest, it is not probable they can be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>The most embarrassing phase which this case could assume would be presented for solution by the surrender of these men. Whatever may be the light in which the captors of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> should be regarded according to the strict rules of law, the <rs>Government</rs> and people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> cannot be indifferent to their fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>They imperilled life and liberty in an enterprise of great hazard, which they honestly believed was invested with the sanction of law, and to which, as a body, I have reason to think, they were mainly impelled by a generous sympathy with our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>Whilst, therefore, in exercising the discretion confided to me, I have determined at least for the present to interpose no claim to the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> as prize of war on behalf of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, I have endeavored to observe a diplomatic reticence as to the view which our Government may ultimately take of that transaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>I can imagine the existence of circumstances under which the <rs>Government</rs>, to save these brave and innocent men from a cruel and unrighteous doom, might claim the benefit of principles which it would not think it judicious to assert if the only interest at stake was <num value="1">one</num> of property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>As to the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>, I find that she had been surrendered to her original owners without the almost invariable requisition of bail to answer prospective demands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>The reasons which induced the judge to depart from the established course of admiralty practice are contained in the opinion (of which I send you a copy). Taking the opinion and the conduct of the magistrate himself during the progress of the cause (of which I also transmit a history) together, I do not believe any judicial proceeding has taken place in a <orgName n="British Court" type="court">British court</orgName> for a century and <num value="0.5">a half</num> so discreditable to its dignity, its intelligence or its justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/><pb id="p.104" n="104"/></p> 
<p>But notwithstanding my indignation at the offensive and unworthy bearing of <persName n="Stewart,Judge,,,," id="n0120.0011.00104.01412" reg="mostcommon:Stewart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Stewart</surname></persName>, I am not willing, after a full examination of the facts of this case, to commit the <rs>Government</rs> to interference with it in any form.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>The moral weight which should attach to its interposition would be impaired by advancing a claim, which it is almost certain would be allowed neither by the <rs>British</rs> courts nor the <rs>British Government</rs>, and which we could sustain only by affirming principles doubtful in law and equivocal in morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>The facts upon which my opinion rests are these: Of the party actually engaged in the capture--<num value="14">fourteen</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> in number &mdash; only <num value="1">one</num> has any claim to the character of a Confederate citizen or belonging in any way to service; this was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> <persName n="Parr,Officer,H.,A.,," id="n0120.0011.00104.01413" reg="expanded:Parr,Henry,A.,,"><roleName n="Officer">Officer</roleName>, <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Parr</surname></persName>, who, although born in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, had lived for the last <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</rs>, <persName n="Braine,,John,C.,," id="n0120.0011.00104.01414" reg="default:Braine,John,C.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Braine</surname></persName>, I have ascertained beyond doubt, had been released from <placeName key="tgn,2335574" n="1.000 8" reg="fort warren, suffolk, massachusetts">Fort Warren</placeName> on the application of the <rs>British Minister</rs>, on the allegation of being a British subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>This, indeed, is the substance of his own admission; nor has he since been within the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>Although he states that he had been in our military service at an earlier period, the declaration is probably untrue, and would not be received to contradict the deliberate and solemn allegation by which he obtained his liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>He is, I think, estopped from claiming &mdash; what, in truth, I do not believe he ever possessed &mdash; the <rs>Confederate</rs> nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>Passing over for the present the consideration of what effect <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00104.01415" reg="mostcommon:Parker,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s connection with this enterprise may have upon its character, it appears to have been a capture made for the benefit of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by a body of men, without any public authority, and who, with the single exception of a subordidinate officer, were <name>British</name> subjects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>I do not think such a case can be brought within the application of the principle, perfectly well settled, and which in a war like the present our Government ought never to yield, that the citizen of a belligerent State, with or without a commission, may capture enemies' property at sea. That doctrine (as may be seen in the elaborate discussion of the opinions of British and foreign jurists by <persName n="Story,Judge,,,," id="n0120.0011.00104.01416" reg="mostcommon:Story,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Story</surname></persName>, in the case of the <term type="ship">Ship</term> <rs type="ship">Emulous</rs>, <num value="1">1</num> <persName n="Gall,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00104.01417" reg="mostcommon:Gall,nomatch:0"><surname>Gall</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>Rep., <num value="563">563</num>, <num value="55">55</num>; <num value="8">8</num> <persName n="Cranch,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00104.01418" reg="mostcommon:Cranch,nomatch:0"><surname>Cranch</surname></persName>, <num value="110">110</num>--a discussion which <persName n="Phillimore,Mister,,,," id="n0120.0011.00104.01419" reg="mostcommon:Phillimore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillimore</surname></persName> pronounces perfectly exhaustive) is founded upon the hostile relations which the mere declaration of war creates between citizens of the contending States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>A commission would appear to me indispensable <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>to enable a belligerent to claim for itself the benefit of captures made in its behalf by citizens of a neutral State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/><persName n="Parr,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00105.01420" reg="nearbymention:Parr,H.,A.,,"><surname>Parr</surname></persName>'s position may be, and in all probability is, very different from that of his associates; but it does not seem to me to have been sufficiently commanding to impress on the enterprise his own nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>The question then recurs, whether the legal complection of this capture can be altered by <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00105.01421" reg="mostcommon:Parker,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s connection with it, assuming that his Confederate character can be established by proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>In the absence of all facilities for investigation (the <orgName n="Law library" type="library">law library</orgName> of the <name>Province</name>, to which I have access, being very meagre), I am not free from all doubt as to the correctness of my conclusions upon this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>The letters of marque, I am disposed to think, attach only to the vessel, and confer authority upon the master, whoever he may be, for the time being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>They do not confer upon the commander a personal authority, which will survive the destruction of his ship (unless in reference to a prize which she may have captured) and enable him to act as a commissioned officer wherever he may be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>If I am correct in this, <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00105.01422" reg="mostcommon:Parker,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Parker</surname></persName> can only be regarded as a private citizen of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, with no right, such as he assumed, to enlist men or appoint officers in its service; and as he was not present when the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> was taken, the character of the capture must be determined by that of persons on board at the time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>If, however, I am mistaken in my view of the law upon this point (which I would be very glad to find), there is another principle which, whilst it would not affect the captors with any crime in the eye of public law, would no doubt be appealed to in order to deprive us of the fruits of the capture &mdash; I mean that enunciated by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, in the case of L'Aneistad De Rues, <num value="5">5</num> <persName n="Wheat,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00105.01423" reg="mostcommon:Wheat,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheat</surname></persName>, <num value="385">385</num>; the <rs>Belle Corunes</rs>, <num value="6">6</num> <persName n="Wheat,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00105.01424" reg="mostcommon:Wheat,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheat</surname></persName>, <num value="152">152</num>; La Conception, ibid, <num value="235">235</num>; La Santissima Trinidad, <num value="7">7</num> <persName n="Wheat,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00105.01425" reg="mostcommon:Wheat,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheat</surname></persName>, <num value="283">283</num> and <num value="9">9</num>, to wit: that where a prize has been taken by any agency created in violation of neutral sovereignty, it will, if brought voluntarily within the neutral jurisdiction, be restored to the original owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>I do not know that the case of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> can be brought within the range of any exception to this principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>The evidence contained in the report of the trial at <placeName reg="Saint John's, Newfoundland, Newfoundland" key="tgn,7012999">Saint Johns</placeName> (of which I send a copy) discloses a clear violation by <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00105.01426" reg="mostcommon:Parker,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Parker</surname></persName> of the <rs>British</rs> foreign enlistment act; and upon this ground alone I apprehend that any claim we might advance to the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> would be defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/><pb id="p.106" n="106"/></p> 
<p>The conduct of the captors after the capture, in peddling the cargo in violation of the revenue laws of the <name>Province</name>, and the appropriation of a portion of the proceeds by some of them to their own use, and all the developments which have been made as to the motives and character of <persName n="Braine,,,,," id="n0120.0011.00106.01427" reg="nearbymention:Braine,John,C.,,"><surname>Braine</surname></persName>, are calculated to throw so much suspicion and discredit around the whole transaction, that I should deem it unwise, even were the law supposed to be in our favor, without weightier reasons than now exist, to compromise the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by assuming its responsibility.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>The brigade had been on outpost duty upon the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road for <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> and nights previous to this engagement, during which portions of it had been sent forward <num value="3">three</num> times to make reconnoissances, which brought on skirmishes with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>Working parties had been engaged also night and day in cutting artillery roads and preparing defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>During the latter portion <pb id="p.114" n="114"/>of these <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC4">Fourth North Carolina</orgName> (<persName n="Grymes,Major,,,," id="n0120.0015.00114.01485" reg="mostcommon:Grymes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Grymes</surname></persName> commanding) was sent to our assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>I mention these circumstances to let it appear, in justice to my command, that their previous labors had been heavy and wearisome when they were assigned to lead the advance on the left of our attacking forces and bring on the engagement which followed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="2MSBattalion">Second Mississippi battalion</orgName>, <persName n="Taylor,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0120.0015.00114.01491" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,Richard,,,:11"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, <num value="300">300</num> strong, were deployed as skirmishers along the edge of the woods in front of the brigade, with general orders to keep <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>The foregoing estimate makes the total strength of the brigade on that day <num value="2065">2,065</num>, exclusive of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Bondurant,Captain,,,," id="n0120.0015.00114.01492" reg="mostcommon:Bondurant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bondurant</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, left subject to <persName n="Hill,Major-General,,,," id="n0120.0015.00114.01493" reg="mostcommon:Hill,A.,P.,,:22"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s own orders &mdash; since, being compelled to advance by the main road on my extreme right, I could not superintend it. In the foregoing order, upon hearing the signal the line of skirmishers promptly advanced into the woods in front, and the brigade followed, moving by the right flanks of regiments at deploying distance and taking direction from the right, which was ordered to keep in a short distance of the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Meanwhile, <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Featherston,General,,,," id="n0120.0015.00114.01494" reg="mostcommon:Featherston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Featherston</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> (<persName n="Anderson,Colonel,,,," id="n0120.0015.00114.01495" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Joseph,R.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> commanding) moved <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile in rear as a support, whilst <persName n="Rodes,General,,,," id="n0120.0015.00114.01496" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rodes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Raines,General,,,," id="n0120.0015.00114.01497" reg="mostcommon:Raines,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Raines</surname></persName> moved in corresponding position on the opposite side of the road.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>My line of skirmishers had advanced only a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> when they encountered that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>The difficulties of the ground were almost insurmountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>The recent rains had formed ponds of water throughout the woods with mud at the bottom, through which the men waded forward knee-deep and occasionally sinking to the hips in boggy places almost beyond the point of extrication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>The forest was so thick and the undergrowth so tangled that it was impracticable to see the heads of the several regiments as they moved forward, and the deploying intervals were in consequence very imperfectly preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>Still all pushed onward with alacrity &mdash; so fast, indeed, that when the skirmishers became heavily <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>engaged, the regiments pressed upon their heels, and the fire became hot along our whole front before emerging from the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>The regiments were brought into line of battle to support the skirmishers, who, without retiring behind them to reform, became in many places intermingled in their ranks, and so continued through-out the day. We drove the enemy before us out of the woods back into the abatis, where they had several regiments drawn up behind a fence to support them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>I am of opinion that the line of skirmishers upon our right, on the opposite side of the road, did not advance so rapidly as our own, for <persName n="Wilson,Major,,,," id="n0120.0015.00115.01498" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,James,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2MSBattalion">Second Mississippi battalion</orgName>, reports that the right of our advancing line was subjected to a fire both from the front and flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>We had now reached the edge of the wood, where the abatis impeded our further advance, and the troops were under heavy fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>Sending my Aid, <persName n="Halsey,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0120.0015.00115.01499" reg="mostcommon:Halsey,D.,P.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Halsey</surname></persName>, my <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, <persName n="Meem,Captain,,,," id="n0120.0015.00115.01500" reg="mostcommon:Meem,J.,Lawrence,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Meem</surname></persName>, and a courier to order the several regiments of the centre and left to move by the left flank, as previously concerted, and endeavor to turn the obstacles in front, I repaired to the right of my line to give the same orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>I now learned that <persName n="McRae,Colonel,,,," id="n0120.0015.00115.01501" reg="mostcommon:McRae,D.,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>McRae</surname></persName>, suffering from previous illness, had been compelled to retire in a state of utter physical exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>I had relied much upon his services in looking after the right of our long line in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>A portion of his regiment I found temporarily confused from causes no way reflecting upon their gallantry, and I assisted <persName n="Sinclair,Major,,,," id="n0120.0015.00115.01502" reg="mostcommon:Sinclair,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Sinclair</surname></persName> to rally them, and they again went forward under his command (see his report). I also assisted <persName n="Christie,Colonel,,,," id="n0120.0015.00115.01503" reg="nearbymention:Christie,E.,G.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Christie</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="NC23">Twenty-third North Carolina</orgName>, to reform and send forward a portion of his regiment, which had halted under the impression that some order had been given to retire (see that report). About the same time, <persName n="Maury,Major,,,," id="n0120.0015.00115.01504" reg="mostcommon:Maury,Dabney,H.,,:5"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName> having fallen, I assisted in keeping the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName> to its place, some embarrassment and delay having been produced by his fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>During this time I was without any staff or couriers, having dispatched my Aid and <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> to carry orders, and my unemployed couriers were either wounded, dismounted or separated from me in going through the woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>Hurrying forward in person to the abatis, I found that as the regiments emerged from the woods they overlapped each other as they deployed, and being thus in many places huddled together, were suffering terribly from the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>The <rs type="role" reg="regimental-Commander">regimental commanders</rs> who had received my orders to move by the left flank were unable to effect the movement in good order under the galling <pb id="p.116" n="116"/>fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>The alternative was adopted to push the regiments forward through the abatis against the enemy, which was done &mdash; the <orgName type="regiment" key="FL2">Second Florida</orgName> on the left and in advance; the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA38">Thirty-eighth Virginia</orgName> now next on its right, only a little behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>I have mentioned the reasons which caused the other regiments to be not quite so far up at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>But they were readily reformed (stragglers excepted), and went forward either by themselves or with other regiments now coming up to their support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>I should have sent back earlier for the supporting brigade to hurry up to our support, but, as already mentioned, had no messenger to send, and could not leave for that purpose myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>I trusted to <persName n="Anderson,Colonel,,,," id="n0120.0015.00116.01505" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Joseph,R.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s intuition as an accomplished soldier to perceive that we were hotly engaged, and, as I anticipated, he arrived upon the field just at the proper time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>The <orgName n="Stonewall Brigade" type="brigade">Stonewall brigade</orgName>, not having the same protection as the <rs>Louisiana</rs> brigade, was broken and scattered through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>As my brigade advanced through the woods to retake the position, the minnie balls were rattling like hail against the trees, and as we debouched into the field through which the railroad cut ran, nothing could be seen between us and the smoke and fire of the enemy's rifles except the tattered battle-flag of the <rs>Louisiana</rs> brigade; the staff of this was stuck in the ground at the edge of the cut, and the brigade was at the bottom of it throwing stones.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>About midway between the woods and the cut I received a wound in the hand; but before we reached the cut, the enemy, who had been terribly punished, commenced to retreat, or, I may say, to fly in great disorder.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>Sir &mdash; Nothing has transpired since the date of my last dispatch to alter my convictions of the impolicy of any intervention by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in the affair of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>I have conversed freely on the subject with eminent legal gentlemen both in official position and out of it. They generally express regret that through the folly and misconduct of the captors the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> was not secured to the use of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>They think, however, that the courts, if required to pass upon the character of the transaction, would have been compelled to regard it as in fact a capture by <name>British</name> subjects never enlisted in our service by any person having authority so to do; or, if otherwise, then enlisted in violation of the neutrality laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>It is morally certain the home Government would not, under the circumstances, allow a claim for compensation for the surrender of the vessel by the judicial authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>And I cannot but think that the presentation of such a claim by our Government and its rejection &mdash; the case being <num value="1">one</num>, as all must admit, very doubtful both in law and in morals &mdash; would impair its public prestige and weaken the moral weight which might attach to its interposition upon future and more important occasions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>None of the captors have as yet been taken under the new warrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>It would embarrass the <rs>Government</rs> here, as much as it would the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, to have the solution of this question forced upon them, in reference to the captors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>Whatever may be the strict legal character of the transaction, public opinion would not tolerate their treatment as pirates, whether by proceedings against them as such on the part of the <name>Colonial</name> authorities, or by their extradition to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>Sir &mdash; The season has thus far rendered it impracticable to forward the arrangements for returning home our escaped prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>The ice has just begun to move in the <rs>Saint Lawrence</rs>, and it will be from the middle to the last of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> before the navigation will be open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>Land carriage at this time through <placeName reg="Canadian River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7019930">Canadian territory</placeName> is out of the question, not only on account of its expense, but the extremely limited facilities which it would afford for transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>I wrote, indeed, upon my arrival, to some of our friends at <placeName reg="Montreal, Ile de Montreal, Quebec" key="tgn,7013051">Montreal</placeName> to send in that way any who might be reached conveniently and who were anxious to reach the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as early as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>I have authorized a gentleman in <placeName reg="Montreal, Ile de Montreal, Quebec" key="tgn,7013051">Montreal</placeName>, who is highly recommended, <persName n="Cromwell,Mister,S.,,," id="n0120.0021.00136.01767" reg="default:Cromwell,S.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, to go at once as far as <placeName reg="Windsor, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,1014538">Windsor</placeName>, and advise our friends of the existence of means to send back our soldiers to their posts, and to bring in some <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num>, who are reported at that point, to take passage on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> boat from <placeName reg="Montreal, Ile de Montreal, Quebec" key="tgn,7013051">Montreal</placeName> or rather <placeName reg="Quebec" key="tgn,7005804">Quebec</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1015022" n="1.000 4" reg="picton, ontario">Picton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>I have also authorized the expenditure, if necessary, of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> at different points to relieve cases of entire destitution, where there was no doubt as to the wish and purpose to get back into the service as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>I feel some apprehension that an effort may be made to capture our men when collected in large numbers on sailing vessels, whilst coming to <placeName reg="Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,7013046">Halifax</placeName>, on the high seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>I see no mode of avoiding the difficulty, however, and I do not know that the risk would be materially increased, whilst the expense would be greatly diminished, by sending them directly to <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName> from <placeName reg="Quebec" key="tgn,7005804">Quebec</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>Please let me hear at once from you on this point, for the unavoidable delay in collecting them along such an extensive frontier will give me an opportunity, at least to some extent, of acting under your specific instructions upon this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>The accommodations of the regular mail steamer from <placeName reg="Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,7013046">Halifax</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName> are not very extensive, and it makes only a round trip in a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>The expense of subsisting them here, as well as the liability of men in their condition to be <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>involved in some disturbance when collected in large numbers, renders it very expedient, if thought safe, to send them directly on from <placeName reg="Quebec" key="tgn,7005804">Quebec</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName> and even also to <placeName key="tgn,7006630;tgn,2535807" n="0.109 000000.2182	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;0.109 000000.2182	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America" reg="nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>I cannot hear with any certainty as to probable number, but unless I receive instructions which impose upon me other duty by the next steamer from <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName>, I purpose going in person probably over the whole line as far as <placeName reg="Windsor, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,1014538">Windsor</placeName>, with a view of making some final arrangements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>My impression, derived from some experience already at this place, is, that of the large number who as escaped Confederates are appealing to public sympathy for material aid, there are some impostors &mdash; some who have never been in the service, but are shirking duty, and some who would be very glad for help here, but are in no haste to return home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>The number of those who will go back to service is entirely conjectural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>The depth of the water being a thing unknown and not easily found out, it was obviously prudent to camp for the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>On the river's edge there was an old building, which seemed a brick <num value="1">one</num>--<num value="1">one</num> wall near the water's edge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>A flight of steep, rough steps led to an open door on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>Up these steps climbed the weary men. Inside there was absolute darkness, but the floor was dry and there was shelter from the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>Feeling about on the floor they satisfied themselves of its cleanliness and dryness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>The faithful old blankets were once more spread, their owners laid down and at once fell into a deep sleep which was not broken till morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>The room was surprisingly small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>When the soldiers entered they had no idea of the size of it, and went to sleep with the impression that it was very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>The morning revealed its dimensions &mdash; about <measure n="120squarefeet" type="area"><measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten</measure> by <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure></measure>. The ferryman was early at his post and put the travelers across cheerfully without charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>Soon after crossing, a good silver-plated tablespoon, bearing the monogram of <num value="1">one</num> of the travelers, purchased from an aged colored woman a large chunk of ashcake and about half a gallon of buttermilk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>This old darkey had lived in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 22" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in her younger days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>She spoke of grown men and women there as <quote>children whar I raised.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you, honey!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>A big log on the roadside furnished a seat for the comfortable consumption of the before-mentioned ashcake and milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>The feast was hardly begun when the tramp of a horse's hoofs were heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>Looking up, the survivors saw with surprise <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0031.00179.02292" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>He was entirely alone, and rode slowly along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>Unconscious that any <num value="1">one</num> saw him, he was yet erect, dignified and apparently as calm and peaceful as the fields and woods around him. Having caught sight of the occupants of the log, he kept his eyes fixed on them, and as he passed, turned slightly, saluted and said, in the most gentle manner: <quote>Good morning, gentlemen; taking your breakfast?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>The soldiers had only time to rise, salute and say: <quote>Yes, sir!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>and he was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/><pb id="p.180" n="180"/></p> 
<p>Having finished as far as they were able the abundant meal furnished by the liberality of the good <quote>old mammy,</quote> the travelers resume their journey greatly refreshed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>It seems that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0031.00180.02293" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> pursued the road which the <quote>survivors</quote> chose, and starting later than they, overtook them, he being mounted and they on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>At any rate it was their good fortune to see him <num value="3">three</num> times on the road from <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 22" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>The incidents introducing <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0031.00180.02294" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> are peculiarly interesting, and while the writer is in doubt as to the <hi rend="italics">day</hi> on which the next and last incident occurred, the reader may rest assured of the truthfulness of the narration as to what occurred and what was said and done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>After the feast of bread and milk, the no longer hungry men pressed on. About the time when men who have eaten a hearty breakfast become again hungry &mdash; as good fortune would have it happen &mdash; they reached a house pleasantly situated and a comfortable place withal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>Approaching the house they were met by an exceedingly kind, energetic and hospitable woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>She promptly asked: <quote>You are not deserters?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/><quote>No,</quote> said the soldiers, <quote>we have our paroles; we are from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 22" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>; we are homeward bound, and called to ask if you could spare us a dinner?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/><quote>Spare you a dinner?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>Certainly I can. My husband is a miller; his mill is right across the road there, down the hill, and I have been cooking all day for the poor, starving men. Take a seat on the porch there and I will get you something to eat.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>By the time the travelers were seated, this admirable woman was in the kitchen at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>The <quote>pat-a-pat, pat, pat, pat, pat-a-pat-a-pat</quote> of the sifter, and the cracking and <quote>fizzing</quote> of the fat bacon as it fried, saluted their hungry ears, and the delicious smell tickled their olfactory nerves most delightfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>Sitting thus, entertained by delightful sounds, breathing the fragrant air and wrapped in meditation &mdash; or anticipation rather, the soldiers saw the dust rise in the air and heard the sound of an approaching party.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>Several horsemen rode up to the road-gate, threw their bridles over the posts or tied to the overhanging boughs and dismounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>They were evidently officers, well dressed fine looking men, and about to enter the gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>Almost at once the men on the porch recognized <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0031.00180.02295" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his son. They were accompanied by other officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>An ambulance had arrived at the gate also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>Without delay they entered and approached the house, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0031.00180.02296" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> preceding the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>Satisfied that it was the <rs>General</rs>'s intention <pb id="p.181" n="181"/>to enter the house, the <num value="2">two</num> <quote>brave survivors</quote> instinctively and respectfully, venerating the approaching man, determined to give him and his companions the porch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>As they were executing a rather rapid and undignified flank movement to gain the right and rear of the house, the voice of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0031.00181.02297" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> overhauled them thus: <quote>Where are you men going?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/><quote>This lady has offered to give us a dinner, and we are waiting for it,</quote> replied the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/><quote>Well you had better move on now &mdash; this gentleman will have quite a large party on him to-day,</quote> said the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>The soldiers touched their caps, said <quote>Yes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>Sir,</quote> and retired, somewhat hurt, to a strong position on a hen-coop in the rear of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>The party then settled on the porch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>The General had of course no authority, and the surrender of the porch was purely respectful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>Knowing this the soldiers were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hurt, but a moment's reflection satisfied them that the <rs>General</rs> was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>He no doubt had suspicions of plunder, and these were increased by the movement of the men to the rear as he approached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>He <hi rend="italics">misinterpreted their conduct</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>The lady of the house (<hi rend="italics">a reward for her name</hi>!) hearing the dialogue in the yard, pushed her head through the crack of the kitchen door, and as she tossed a lump of dough from hand to hand and gazed eagerly out, addressed the soldiers: <quote>Ain't that old <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0031.00181.02298" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/><quote>Yes, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0031.00181.02299" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his son and other officers come to dine with you,</quote> they replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/><quote>Well,</quote> she said, <quote>he ain't no better than the men that fought for him, and I don't reckon he is as hungry; so you just come in here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>I am going to give you yours <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and then I'll get something for him!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>What a meal it was. Seated at the <rs n="kitchen table" type="product">kitchen-table</rs>, the large hearted woman bustling about and talking away, the ravenous tramps attacked a pile of Old Virginia hoecake and corn-dodger, a frying pan with an inch of gravy and slices of bacon, streak of lean and streak of fat, very numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>To finish &mdash; as much rich buttermilk as the drinkers could contain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>With many heartfelt thanks the survivors bid farewell to this immortal woman, and leaving the <rs>General</rs> and his party in quiet possession of the front porch, pursued their way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>Night found the <quote>survivors</quote> at the gate of a quite handsome, framed, country residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>The weather was threatening, and it was desirable to have shelter as well as rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>Entering and knocking at the door they were met by a servant girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>She was sent to her mistress with a request for permission to sleep on her premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/><pb id="p.182" n="182"/>The servant returned, saying: <quote>Mistis say she's a widder, and there ain't no gentleman in the house, and she can't let you come in.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>She was sent with a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> message, which informed the lady that the visitors were from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 22" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, members of a certain company from there, and would be content with permission to sleep on the porch, in the stable or in the barn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>They would protect her property, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>This message brought the lady of the house to the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2456"/>She said: <quote>If you are members of the--------, you must know my nephew; he was in that company.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2457"/>Of course they knew him. <quote>Old chum,</quote> <quote>comrade,</quote> <quote>particular friend,</quote> <quote>splendid fellow,</quote> <quote>hope he was well when you heard from him; glad to meet you, madam!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>These and similar hearty expressions brought the longed for <quote>come in, gentlemen, you are welcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2459"/>I will see that supper is prepared for you at once.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2460"/>(Invitation accepted.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>The old haversacks were deposited in a corner under the steps and their owners conducted down stairs to a spacious dining-room, quite prettily furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>A large table occupied the centre of the room, and at <num value="1">one</num> side there was a handsome display of silver in a glass-front case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>A good, big fire lighted the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>The lady sat quietly working at some woman's work, and from time to time questioning, in a <hi rend="italics">rather suspicious</hi> manner, her guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>Their correct answers satisfied her and their respectful manner reassured her, so that by the time supper was brought in she was chatting and laughing with her <quote>defenders.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2466"/>The supper came in steaming hot. It was abundant, well prepared and served elegantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>Splendid coffee, hot biscuit, luscious butter, fried ham, eggs-fresh milk!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>The writer could not expect to be believed if he should tell the quantity eaten at that meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>The good lady of the house enjoyed the sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>She relished every mouthful, and no doubt realized then and there the blessing which is conferred on hospitality and the truth of that saying of old: <quote>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>The wayfarers were finally shown to a neat little chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>The bed was soft and glistening white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>Too white and clean to be soiled by the occupancy of <num value="2">two</num> Confederate soldiers who had not had a change of underclothing for many weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>They looked at it, felt of it, spread their old blankets on the neat carpet and slept there till near the break of day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/>While it was yet dark the travelers, unwilling to lose time waiting for breakfast, crept out of the house, leaving their thanks for <pb id="p.183" n="183"/>their kind hostess, and pressed rapidly on to <placeName reg="Manikin Town">Manikin Town</placeName>, on the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kanawha canal">Kanawha canal</placeName>, half a day's march from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 22" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, where they arrived while it was yet early morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>The green sward between the canal and river was inviting and the survivors laid there awhile to rest and determine whether or not they would push on to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>They decided to do so as soon as they could find a breakfast to fit them for the day's march.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>A short walk placed them at the yard gate of a house prominent by reason of its size and finish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>Everything indicated comfort, plenty and freedom from the ravages of war. The proprietor, a well fed, hearty man of not more than <num value="42">forty-two</num> or <num value="3">three</num>, who, as a soldier could tell at a glance, had never seen a day's service, stood behind the tall gate, and without a motion towards opening it replied to the cheery <quote>good morning, sir!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>of the soldiers with a sullen <quote>morn &mdash; what do you want here?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/><quote>We are from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 22" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, sir, members of the------.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>(A <hi rend="italics">large</hi> reward for <hi rend="italics">his</hi> name). The foragers, having worked for a meal before and being less sensitive than <quote>penniless gentlemen</quote> sometimes are, replied: <quote><hi rend="italics">We</hi> are not horse thieves or beggars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>If you do not feel that it would be a pleasure and a privilege to feed us, <hi rend="italics">don't do it</hi>! We don't propose to press the matter.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>At last he said: <quote>Come in, then; I'll see what I can do.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>The seekers after food accepted the ungracious invitation, followed the dog through his yard and into his house and took seats at his table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>At a signal from the master a servant went out. The host followed and, it is supposed, instructed her. The host returned and was soon followed by the servant bearing <num value="2">two</num> plates, which were placed before the <quote>survivors.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>Alas! that they should <quote>survive</quote> to see the plates contained the heads, tails, fins and vertibrae of the fish, fresh from the river, which the family of this hero and sufferer from the evils of war had devoured at their early and no doubt cosy breakfast.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>The <quote>host</quote> followed amazed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/><quote>What's the matter, gentlemen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>You did <pb id="p.184" n="184"/>not eat!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>The <quote>poor soldiers</quote> replied: <quote>No, we didn't eat; we are not dogs.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>The man fairly trembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>His face was pale with rage, but he dared not reply as he would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>Recovering himself, and seeing an odorous name in the future, he attempted apology and reparation for the insult and complete reconciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>But the boys wouldn't <quote>go in.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>On the contrary they staid out persistently, and, before they left that gate, heaped on its owner all the contempt, disdain and scorn which they could express; flung at him all the derisive epithets which <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> in the army places at a man's disposal; pooh poohed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>at his hypocritical regrets, and shaking off the dust of that place from their feet, pushed on to the city, the smoke of which rose to heaven.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>At <time value="11am">11 A. M.</time> of the same day <num value="2">two</num> footsore, despondent and penniless men stood facing the ruins of the home of a comrade who had sent a message to his mother: <quote>Tell mother I am coming.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>A friend informed the survivors that day that farm hands were needed all around the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>The desperate state of things was visible to every eye. Not an infantry soldier of ours was to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/><placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName> was the nearest point on our line still held by us, and the attack on it had commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>There was a battery, but the horses were so weak that they could not pull the guns into position until the enemy were prepared to drive it away from the position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>The enemy's line was in the edge of the woods, some mile beyond <placeName><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0120.0033.00193.02428" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, with batteries near; nothing between.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>We went to the position indicated, which was about <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure> from the enemy's line in the woods, with open, level ground between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>They soon opened fire on us from a number of guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>The fire was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rather wild, but it soon improved; and as the batteries were too far off for our arms, we dropped back a short distance and took up a less exposed position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>The batteries made a corresponding change, and when their fire again became good, we fell back a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time and took a safer position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>They again found a position from which they commanded us; we again moved back and got a position which afforded considerable protection to most of our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>Here we remained for a good while under the artillery fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>We had ourselves never fired a gun. The fire towards <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName> ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>I ran up a long hill and found that the fort had fallen, and at. the same time that the enemy's <pb id="p.194" n="194"/>infantry were advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>Returning, I ordered the <num value="2">two</num> regiments to a new position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>Here I soon received an order from <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0120.0033.00194.02429" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> to take the <num value="20" type="ordinal">Twentieth</num> back across the creek and occupy some incomplete works that had been thrown up recently, leaving the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> to skirmish with the enemy and retard his advance as long as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>This order was executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> deployed, as skirmishers and kept the enemy's skirmishers in check for a long time, falling back slowly until they came to the hill next the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>There they stopped and held the position all day. <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0120.0033.00194.02430" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> complimented them there on the field, as I was told.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>The <num value="20" type="ordinal">Twentieth</num> crossed the creek and entered the works, where they received the fire of the enemy's artillery for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>His advancing infantry began to show itself in long lines on the opposite side of the creek; but about this time, say <time value="4pm">4 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>The enemy's infantry seeing this, halted; nor did it advance afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>What was the loss was never reported to me, but it was not large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>Both officers and men evinced a perfect appreciation of the situation and of the object to be accomplished, and executed every movement with promptitude, order and decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>We were the last to leave the line on the retreat &mdash; leaving it about midnight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>All was done under the immediate eye of <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0120.0033.00194.02434" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, who rode <quote>the colt</quote> everywhere, frequently in front of the line, up and down, with grand unconcern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>They gathered in groups and debated the question whether we should <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>not cut our way out and escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>The artillery attached to my command received its orders through its immediate commander, and moved off a little before dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>I was directed to leave the skirmishers in my front, and was informed that they would be relieved during the night by the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>The officers in charge of the skirmishers were directed, as soon as relieved, to take the road followed by the division.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>The night was entirely dark, and the roads in a dreadful condition &mdash; the entire distance between our breastworks and <placeName key="tgn,2118207" n="1.000 18" reg="falling waters, berkeley, west virginia">Falling Waters</placeName> being ankle deep in mud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2660"/>On the left of the road and on the crest of this hill our engineers had thrown up some half dozen epaulements for artillery, the spaces between the epaulements being open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2661"/>In our front was an open space, with the view unobstructed for half to <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile; then came a heavy piece of timber, some <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile in width.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2662"/>I was directed, at the same time that I received the order to place my division in line of battle, as described, to put <orgName n="division"><persName n="Pender,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00196.02453" reg="mostcommon:Pender,nomatch:0"><surname>Pender</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> in rear of my own in column of brigades.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2663"/>At this point we halted, to allow the wagons and artillery to get <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>over the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2664"/>We remained in this position awaiting their crossing for several hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2665"/>About <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> I received orders from <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0120.0035.00197.02454" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> to move <orgName n="division"><persName n="Pender,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00197.02455" reg="mostcommon:Pender,nomatch:0"><surname>Pender</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> across the river, following <orgName n="division"><persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0120.0035.00197.02456" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, and after leaving <num value="1">one</num> brigade of my division in line, to follow up the movement of the corps as speedily as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2666"/>About <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> after receiving these orders and while they were in progress of execution, a small body of cavalry &mdash; numbering not more than <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="45">forty five</num> men-made their appearance in our front, where the road debouched from the woods, previously described.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>I will here remark that when on the road, and some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the position I now occupied, a large body of our cavalry passed by my command going to our rear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>When the cavalry alluded to made its appearance, it was at once observed by myself; <persName n="Pettigrew,General,,,," id="n0120.0035.00197.02457" reg="mostcommon:Pettigrew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pettigrew</surname></persName> and several members of my staff, as well as many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>On emerging from the woods, the party faced about, apparently acting on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>Suddenly facing my position, they galloped up the road and halted some <measure n="175yards" type="distance">one hundred and seventy-five yards</measure> from my line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>From their manoeuvring, and the smallness of numbers, I concluded it was a party of our own cavalry, pursued by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>In this opinion I was sustained by all present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>It was not until I examined them critically with my glasses, at a distance of not more than <measure n="175yards" type="distance">one hundred and seventy-five yards</measure>, that I discovered they were Federal troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>The men had been restrained from firing up to this time by <persName n="Pettigrew,General,,,," id="n0120.0035.00197.02458" reg="mostcommon:Pettigrew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pettigrew</surname></persName> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>The command was now given (orders) to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>At the same time the <rs>Federal</rs> officer in command gave the order to charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>The squad passed the intervals separating the epaulements, and fired several shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>In less than <measure n="3minutes" type="date">three minutes</measure> all were killed or captured, save <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num>, who are said to have escaped.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/><persName n="Pettigrew,General,,,," id="n0120.0035.00197.02459" reg="mostcommon:Pettigrew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pettigrew</surname></persName> received a wound in <num value="1">one</num> of his hands at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, in consequence of which he was unable to manage his horse, which reared and fell with him. It is probable, when in the act of rising from the ground, that he was struck by a pistol ball in the side (left), which, unfortunately for himself and his country, proved mortal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>A soldier of the <orgName type="regiment" key="7TNRegiment">Seventh Tennessee regiment</orgName> was at the same time mortally wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>This was the entire loss of my command from this charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/><num value="33">Thirty-three</num> of the enemy's dead were counted, <measure n="6" type="prisoners">six prisoners</measure> fell into our hands, also a stand of colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/><pb id="p.198" n="198"/></p> 
<p>Very soon after this a large body of dismounted cavalry, supported by artillery, of which I had none, made a vigorous attack on <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Brockenbrough,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02460" reg="mostcommon:Brockenbrough,nomatch:0"><surname>Brockenbrough</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, which was deployed in line of battle to the right of the road.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/><persName n="Brockenbrough,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02461" reg="mostcommon:Brockenbrough,nomatch:0"><surname>Brockenbrough</surname></persName> repelled the attack, and drove the enemy back into the woods, following him up for some distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>The enemy was now heavily reinforced, and <persName n="Brockenbrough,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02462" reg="mostcommon:Brockenbrough,nomatch:0"><surname>Brockenbrough</surname></persName> was compelled to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>His brigade, having been badly cut up on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, was much reduced in numbers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>Seeing that the enemy evidently designed turning his right flank and thus cutting him off from the river, <persName n="Brockenbrough,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02463" reg="mostcommon:Brockenbrough,nomatch:0"><surname>Brockenbrough</surname></persName> deployed his brigade as skirmishers, extending well to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>About this time the enemy appeared on my left flank in force, also in my front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>Seeing the attack was becoming serious, I ordered the several brigades of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Pender,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02464" reg="mostcommon:Pender,nomatch:0"><surname>Pender</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> (except <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02465" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,B.,G.,,:1"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>', which had crossed the river) to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>I at the same time sent a message to the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> Commanding, requesting that artillery migh be sent me, as I had none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>On returning, my aid informed me that <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02466" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> directed me to withdraw my command as speedily as possible and cross the river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>When this order was received, my line of skirmishers occupied a front of a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num>--the left resting on the canal, the right bending around well towards the <rs>Potomac</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>The orders were that the several brigades in line should withdraw simultaneously, protecting their front by a strong line of skirmishers and converge toward the road leading to <placeName key="tgn,2118207" n="1.000 18" reg="falling waters, berkeley, west virginia">Falling Waters</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>In order to cover this movement, <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02467" reg="mostcommon:Lane,James,H.,,:5"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> was formed in line of battle about <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure> in rear of the advanced line, protected by a heavy line of skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">first brigade</orgName> that passed through <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02468" reg="mostcommon:Lane,James,H.,,:5"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s line of battle was reformed in line of battle <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile or more in rear of <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0120.0035.00198.02469" reg="mostcommon:Lane,James,H.,,:5"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s position; and so on till the command reached the south bank of the <placeName reg="Hodgson Point, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,7020782">Potomac</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>With the extended line of skirmishers in my front, and being compelled to fall back upon a single road, it was not surprising that in attempting to reach the road, over ravines impassible at many points, and through a thick undergrowth and wood, and over a country with which both men and officers were unacquainted, that many of them were lost and thus fell into the hands of the enemy, who pushed vigorously forward on seeing that I was retiring.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>The enemy made <num value="2">two</num> cavalry charges, and on each occasion I <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>witnessed the unhorsing of the entire party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>I desire here to brand upon its perpetrator a falsehood, and correct an error.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>He knows full well that no organized body of men were captured &mdash; not even a company was captured, nor the majority of a single company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>He asserts, however, that he captured an entire brigade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>The error I wish to correct is attributing all the men captured by the enemy on the <num value="14" type="ordinal">14th</num> as belonging to my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>I think I state correctly when I say that <num value="3">three</num> out of <num value="4">four</num> of the men captured by the enemy were captured between our works near <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName> and the point where I engaged the enemy, and were the representatives of every corps, division and brigade who passed over this road.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>In conclusion, I will add that the brigade commanders did their duty, and the losses sustained were not attributable to any errors or short-comings of theirs, but resulted from causes beyond their control.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>The <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> of a large army, protecting its crossing over a wide river, can seldom fail to lose heavily if vigorously pursued by the enemy, especially when in the act of crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>The events which have occurred since our commissioners had their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> interview with <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n0120.0040.00231.02991" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> have placed our claims to recognition in a much stronger point of view; but in presenting the case once more to the <rs>British Government</rs>, you ought again to explain the true position in which we appear before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>We are not to be viewed as revolted provinces or rebellious subjects, seeking to overthrow the lawful authority of a common sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>Neither are we warring for rights of a doubtful character, or such as are to be ascertained only by implication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>On the contrary, the <rs>Union</rs> from which we have withdrawn was founded upon the express stipulations of a written instrument which established a government whose powers were to be exercised for certain declared purposes and restricted within well defined limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>When a sectional and dominant majority persistently violated the covenants and conditions <pb id="p.232" n="232"/>of that compact, those States whose safety and well-being depended upon the perfomance of these covenants were justly absolved from all moral obligation to remain in such a Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>And when the government of that Union, instead of affording protection to their social system, itself threatened not merely to disturb the peace and the security of its people, but also to destroy their social system, the <name>States</name> thus menaced owed it to themselves and their posterity to withdraw immediately from a Union whose very bonds prevented them from defending themselves against such dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>Such were the causes which led the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to form a new Union, to be composed of more homogeneous materials and interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>Experience had demonstrated to them that a union of <num value="2">two</num> different and hostile social systems under a Government in which <num value="1">one</num> of them wielded nearly all the power, was not only illassorted, but dangerous in the extreme to the weaker section whose scheme of society was thus unprotected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>Prompted by these teachings, <num value="11">eleven</num> sovereign States, bound together by the tie of a common social system and by the sympathies of identical interests, have instituted a new Confederacy and a new Government, which they justly hope will be more harmonizing in its operation and more permanent in its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>In forming this Government they seek to preserve their old institutions and to pursue through their new organic law the very ends and purposes for which, as they believe, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>It was because a revolution was sought to be made in the spirit and ends of the organic law of their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> union by a dominant and Sectional majority, operating through the machinery of a government which was in their hands and placed there for different purposes, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> withdrew themselves from the jurisdiction of such a government and established another for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>Their example, therefore, furnishes no precedent for the overthrow of the lawful authority of a regular government by revolutionary violence, nor does it encourage a resort to factious tumult and civil war by irresponsible bodies of men. On the contrary, their union has been formed through the regular action of the sovereign States composing the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and it has established a government competent to the discharge of all its civil functions and entirely responsible; both in war and peace, for all its actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>Nor has that Government shown itself unmindful of the obligation which its people incurred whilst their States were members of the former union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>On the contrary, <num value="1">one</num> of their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>acts was to send commissioners to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to adjust amicably all subjects of difference and to provide for a peaceable separation and a fair satisfaction of the mutual claims of the <num value="2">two</num> Confederacies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>These commissioners were not received, and all offers for a peaceful accommodation were contemptuously rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>The authority of our Government itself was denied, its people denounced as rebels, and a war was waged against them, which, if carried on in the spirit it was proclaimed, must be the most sanguinary and barbarous which has been known for centuries among civilized people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have thus been forced to take up arms in defence of their right to self-government, and in the name of that sacred right they have appealed to the nations of the earth, not for material aid or alliances, offensive and defensive, but for the moral weight which they would derive from holding a recognized place as a free and independent people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>In asking for this they feel that they will not receive more than they will give in return, and they offer, as they think, a full equivalent for any favor that may thus be granted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>Diplomatic relations are established mainly to protect human intercourse and to adjust peaceably the differences which spring from such intercourse or arise out of the conflicting interests of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>The advantages of such an intercourse are mutual, and in general, as between nations, any <num value="1">one</num> of them receives as much as it gives, to say nothing of the well being of human society which is promoted by placing its relations under the protection and restraints of public law. It would seem, then, that a new Confederacy asking to establish diplomatic relations with the world ought not to be required to do more than to present itself through a government competent to discharge its civil functions and strong enough to be responsible for its actions to the other nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>After this is shown, the great interests of peace and the general good of society would seem to require that a speedy recognition should follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>It cannot be difficult to show in our case a strict compliance with these, the just conditions of our recognition as an independent people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>If we were pleading for favors we might ask and find more than <num value="1">one</num> precedent in <name>British</name> history for granting the request that we be recognized for the sake of that sacred right of self-government for which we are this day in arms, and which we have been taught to prize by the teachings, the traditions and the example of the race from which we have sprung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>But we do not place ourselves before the bar of nations to ask for favors; we seek for what we believe to <pb id="p.234" n="234"/>be justice not only to ourselves, but justice to the great interests of peace and humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>If the recognition of our independence must finally come and if it be only a work of time, it seems to be the duty of each of the nations of the earth to throw the moral weight of its recognition into the scale of peace as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>For, to delay, will only be to prolong unnecessarily the sufferings of war. If then our Government can be shown to be such as has been here described, we shall place ourselves in the position of a people who are entitled to a recognition of their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>The physical and moral elements of our Confederacy, its great, but undeveloped capacities, and its developed strength as proved by the history of the conflict in which we are now engaged, ought to satisfy the world of the responsible character of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>The <num value="11">eleven</num> States now confederated together cover <num value="733144">seven hundred and thirty-three thousand one hundred and forty-four</num> square miles of territory and embrace <num value="9000000">nine millions</num> <num value="244000">two hundred and forty-four thousand</num> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>This territory, large enough to become the seat of an immense power, embraced not only all the best varieties of climate and production known to the temperate zone, but also the great staples of cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>It teems with the resources, both moral and physical, of a great empire, and nothing is wanted but time and peace for their development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>To these States there will probably be added hereafter <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, whose interests and sympathies must bind them to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>If these are added, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will embrace <num value="850000">eight hundred and fifty thousand</num> square miles of territory and <num value="12.5">twelve and a half</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of people, to say nothing of the once common Territories west of these States, which will probably fall into the new Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>Is it to be supposed that such a people and with such resources can be subdued in war when subjugation is to be followed by such consequences as would result from their conquest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>If such a supposition prevails anywhere, it can find no countenance in the history of the contest in which we are now engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>In the commencement of this struggle, our enemies had in their possession the machinery of the old Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>The naval, and, for the most part, the military establishments, were in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>They had, too, most of the accumulated capital and nearly all the manufactories of arms, ordnance and of the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>They had all the means of striking us hard blows before we could be ready to return them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>And yet in the face of all this we have instituted <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>a government and placed more than <num value="200000">200,000</num> men in the field with an adequate staff and commissariat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>A still larger number of men are ready to take the field if it should become necessary, and experience has shown that the only limit to the disposition of the people to give what may be required for the war is to be found in their ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>The enemy, with greatly superior numbers, have been routed in pitched battles at <placeName reg="Bethel, Oxford, Maine" key="tgn,2044460">Bethel</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 11" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and their recent defeat at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield, Missouri</placeName>, was almost as signal as that of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>The comparatively little foothold which they have had in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is gradually being lost, and after <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> of war, in which they employed their best resources, it may truly be said they are much further from the conquest of the <rs>Southern States</rs> than they seemed to be when the struggle commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>The Union feeling which was supposed to exist largely in the <rs>South</rs>, and which was known to us to be imaginary, is now shown in the true light to all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>Never were any people more united than are those of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in their purpose to maintain their independence at any cost of life and treasure, nor is there a party to be found anywhere in these States which professes a desire for a reunion with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3126"/>Nothing could prove this unanimity of feeling more strongly than the fact that this immense army may be said to have taken the field spontaneously and faster almost than the <rs>Government</rs> could provide for its organization and equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3127"/>But the voluntary contributions of the people supplied all deficiencies until the <rs>Government</rs> could come to their assistance, as it has done, with the necessary military establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3128"/>And what is perhaps equally remarkable, it may be said with truth, that there has been no judicial execution for a political offence during the whole of the war, and so far as military offences are concerned our prisons would be empty if it were not for a few captured spies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>Under these circumstances it would seem that the time has arrived when it would be proper in the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to recognize our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>If it be obvious that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> cannot be conquered in this struggle, then the sooner the strife be ended the better for the cause of peace and the interests of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3131"/>Under such circumstances, to fail to throw the great moral influence of such a recognition into the scale of peace, when this may be done without risk or danger, may be to share in the responsibility for the longer continuance of an unnecessary war. This is a consideration which ought, perhaps, to have some weight <pb id="p.236" n="236"/>with a nation which leads so largely, as does that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in the progress of <name>Christian</name> civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>That the <rs>British</rs> people have a deep political and commercial interest in the establishment of the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> must be obvious to all. Their real interest in that event is only a little less than our own. The great question of cotton supply, which has occupied their attention so justly and so anxiously for some years past, will then be satisfactorily settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/>Whilst the main source of cotton production was in the hands of such a power as that of the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and controlled by those who were disposed to use that control to acquire the supremacy in navigation, commerce and manufactures over all rivals, there was just cause for anxiety on the part of nations who were largely dependent upon this source of supply for the raw material of important manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>But the case will be far different when peace is conquered and the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3135"/>Within these States must be found for years to come the great source of cotton supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>So favorable a combination of soil, climate and labor is nowhere else to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>Their capacity for increased production has so far kept pace with the increased demand, and in time of peace it promises to do so for a long while to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>In the question of the supply of this great staple there is a world-wide interest, and if the nations of the earth could choose for themselves a single depository for such an interest, perhaps none could be found to act so impartially in that capacity as the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>Their great interest is and will be, for a long time to come, in the production and exportation of the important staples so much sought by the rest of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>It would be long before they would become the rivals of those who are largely concerned in navigation, manufactures and commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>On the contrary, these interests would make them valuable customers and bind them to the policy of free trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>Their early legislation, which has thrown open their navigation, foreign and coasting, to the free competition of all nations, and which has imposed the lowest duties on imports consistent with their necessary revenue wants, proves the natural tendency of their commercial policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>Under such circumstances, the supply of cotton to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> would be as abundant, as cheap and as certain as if these States were themselves her colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>The establishment of such an empire, committed, as it would be, to the policy of free trade by its interests and traditions would seem to be a matter of primary importance to the progress of <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>human industry and the great cause of human civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>It would be of the deepest interest to such a government to preserve peace, and to improve its opportunities for the pursuit of the useful arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>The residue of the world would find here, too, sources of supply of more than <num value="1">one</num> of the great staples in which manufactures and commerce are most deeply interested, and these sources would probably prove to be not only constant, as being little likely to be troubled by the chances of war, but also of easy access to all who might desire to resort to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>In presenting the great importance of this question to the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in its connection with their material interests, you will not omit its bearing upon the future political relations between the old and the new world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>With a balance of power established between the great Confederacies on the <rs>North American</rs> continent, the fears of a disturbance of the peace of the world from the desire for the annexation of contiguous territory on the part of a vast and overshadowing political and military organization will be dissipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>Under the former Union the slaveholding States had an interest in the acquisition of territory suitable to their institutions in order to establish a balance of power within the <rs>Government</rs> for their own protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>This reason no longer exists, as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have sought that protection by a separation from the <rs>Union</rs> in which their rights were endangered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>It is manifest from the nature of its interests that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> in entering as a new member in the family of nations would exercise not a disturbing but a harmonizing influence on human society, for it would not only desire peace itself, but to some extent become a bond of peace amongst others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>In offering these views to the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, you will be able to say with truth that you present a case precisely and entirely within the principles upon which it has acted since <dateStruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></dateStruct>,--principles so well stated by <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n0120.0040.00237.02992" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> in his dispaches upon the <rs>Italian</rs> question that they can not be better defined than in his own words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3153"/>In his letter to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Cowley</foreName></persName>, of the <dateStruct value="1859-11-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1859</year>,</dateStruct> after adverting to the action of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></dateStruct> in regard to the declarations of the <name>Congresses</name> of Troppan and Laybach; in <dateStruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct> in regard to the <rs>Congress</rs> of <placeName reg="Verona, Lee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057702">Verona</placeName>, and in <dateStruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> in the cases of the <rs>South American Republics</rs>, of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>, he says: <quote>Thus in these <num value="5">five</num> instances the policy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> appears to have been directed by a consistent principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>She uniformly withheld her consent to acts of intervention by force to alter the internal <pb id="p.238" n="238"/>government of other nations; she uniformly gave her countenance, and if necessary her aid, to consolidate the de facto governments which arose in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> or <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3155"/>To recognize the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as an independent power would be to give her countenance to consolidate a de facto government in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> which is already supported by a force strong enough to defend it against all probable assaults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>To withhold that recognition would certainly encourage the armed intervention of a government, now foreign to us, for the purpose of altering the internal government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName> In his letter of <dateStruct value="1859-12-03"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="3">3d</day>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, to <persName n="Loftus,Lord,A.,,," id="n0120.0040.00238.02993" reg="default:Loftus,A.,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Loftus</surname></persName>, in regard to the controversy between <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> and her provinces, he says: <quote>We, at least, are convinced that an authority restored by force of arms constantly opposed by the national wishes would afford no solid and durable basis for the pacification and welfare of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>Is not this sentiment still more applicable to the contest now being waged between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>Again, in his dispatch of <dateStruct value="1859-11-26"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="26">26th</day>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, to <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Cowley</foreName></persName>, he declared that <quote>It would be an invidious task to discuss the reasons which, in the view of the people of <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Central Italy</placeName>, justified their acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>It will be sufficient to say that since the peace of <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct> <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> predecessors have recognized the separation of the <rs>Spanish Colonies</rs> in <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>; of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, from the dominion of the <name>Sultan</name>; and of <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName> from <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n0120.0040.00238.02994" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>In the opinion of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government, the reasons adduced in favor of these separations were not stronger than those which have been alleged at <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>, <placeName reg="Parma, Emilia-Romagna, Italia" key="tgn,7003131">Parma</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7004597" n="1.000 1" reg="modena">Modena</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna" key="tgn,7004847">Bologna</placeName> in justification of the course the people of those States have pursued.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>Were the reasons <quote>alleged</quote> in the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>, <placeName reg="Parma, Emilia-Romagna, Italia" key="tgn,7003131">Parma</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7004597" n="1.000 1" reg="modena">Modena</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna" key="tgn,7004847">Bologna</placeName>, whose people are thus assumed to be the judges in a matter so nearly touching their happiness as their internal government, at all stronger than those <quote>alleged</quote> by the people of the <num value="11">eleven</num> sovereign States now confederated together for withdrawing from a Union formed by a voluntary compact upon conditions which were persistently violated and with covenants essential to their domestic repose openly threatened to be broken?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>But appended to this letter of instructions you will find more extended extracts from the letters here referred to, for your especial reference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>There is yet another question of great practical importance to us and to the world, which you will present on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proper occasion to Her Britannic Majesty's Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>It was declared by the <num value="5">five</num> great powers at the <name>Conference</name> <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> that <quote>blockades to be binding must be effectual.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>A principle long since sanctioned by leading publicists and now acknowledged by nearly all civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>You will be furnished with abundant evidence of the fact that the blockade of the coasts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has not been effectual or of such a character as to be binding according to the declaration of the <name>Conference</name> at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>Such being the case, it may, perhaps, be fairly urged that the <num value="5">five</num> great powers owe it to their own consistency and to the world to make good a declaration thus solemnly made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>Propositions of such gravity and emanating from sources so high may fairly be considered as affecting the general business relations of human society and as controlling, in a great degree, the calculations and arrangements of nations, so far as they are concerned, in the rules thus laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>Men have a right to presume that a law thus proclaimed will be universally maintained by those who have the power to do so and who have taken it upon themselves to watch over its execution, nor will any suppose that particular States or cases would be exempted from its operation under the influence of partiality or favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>If, therefore, we can prove the blockade to have been ineffectual, we, perhaps, have a right to expect that the nations assenting to this declaration of the <name>Conference</name> at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> will not consider it to be binding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>We are fortified in this expectation, not only by their own declarations, but by the nature of the interests affected by the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>So far, at least, it has been proved that the only certain and sufficient source of cotton supply has been found in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>It is probable that there are more people without than within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> who derive their means of living from the various uses which are made of this important staple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>A war, therefore, which shuts up this great source of supply from the general uses of mankind is directed as much against those who transport and manufacture cotton as against those who produce the raw material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>Innocent parties, who are thus affected, insist that a right, whose exercise operates so unfavorably on them, shall only be used within the strictest limits of public law. Would it not be a movement more in consonance with the spirit of the age to insist that amongst the many efficient means of waging war, this <num value="1">one</num> should be excepted in deference to the general interests of mankind, so many of whom depend for their means of living upon a ready and easy access to the greatest and cheapest cotton market in the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>If, for the general benefit of commerce, some of its great routes have been neutralized so <pb id="p.240" n="240"/>as to be unaffected by the chances of war, might not another interest of a greater and more world-wide importance claim at least so much consideration as to demand the benefit of every presumption in favor of its protection against all the chances of war, save those-which arise under the strictest rules of public law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>This is a question of almost as much interest to the world at large as it is to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>No belligerent can claim the right thus to injure innocent parties by such a blockade, except to the extent that it can be shown to furnish the legitimate, or perhaps we might go still further and say the necessary, means to prosecute the war successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>If it has become obvious, as would now seem to be the case, that no blockade which they can maintain will enable the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to subdue the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>, upon what plea can its further continuance be justified to <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> parties, who are so deeply interested in a ready and easy access to the cheapest and most abundant sources of cotton supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>Perhaps we had the right to expect, inasmuch as by the proclamation of Her Britannic Majesty neutrality had been declared as between the belligerents, that <num value="1">one</num> of the parties would not have been allowed to close the ports of the other by a mere proclamation of blockade without an adequate force to sustain it. In presenting the various views contained in this letter of instructions, you will say that they are offered as much in the general interests of mankind as in our own. We do not ask for assistance to enable us to maintain our independence against any power which has yet assailed us. <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> believes that he cannot be mistaken in supposing it to be the duty of the nations of the earth by a prompt recognition to throw the weight of their moral influence against the unnecessary prolongation of the war. Whether the case now presented be <num value="1">one</num> for such action, he is perhaps not the most impartial judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>He has discharged his duty to other nations when he has presented to their knowledge the facts to which their only sure access is through himself, in such a manner as will enable them to acquit themselves of their responsibilities to the world according to their own sense of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>But whilst he neither feels nor affects an indifference to the decision of the world upon these questions which deeply concern the interests of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, he does not present their claim to a recognized place amongst the nations of the earth from the belief that any such recognition is necessary to enable them to achieve and secure their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>Such an act might diminish the <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>sufferings and shorten the duration of an unnecessary war, but with or without it he believes that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, under the guidance of a kind and overruling <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, will make good their title to freedom and independence and to a recognized place amongst the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>When you are officially recognized by the <rs>British Government</rs>, and diplomatic relations between the <num value="2">two</num> countries are thus fully established, you will request an audience of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name>, for the purpose of presenting your letters accrediting you as Envoy Extraordinary and <rs type="role" reg="Minister Plenipotentiary">Minister Plenipotentiary</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> near <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name>, and in that capacity you are empowered to negotiate such treaties as the mutual interests of both countries may require, subject of course to the approval of the <rs>President</rs> and the co-ordinate branch of the treaty-making power.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>She had scarcely got fairly <pb id="p.266" n="266"/>into the <rs>North</rs> sea when the weather, always boisterous in those latitudes in the winter season, became so bad that the captain conceived it prudent to put into Christiansand in <placeName reg="Norge, Europe, " key="tgn,1000088">Norway</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>Time was precious &mdash; for there were pressing obligations pending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>The suggestion was the prompting of gallant, generous spirits, who invariably <pb id="p.274" n="274"/>sympathize with the weaker party in all conflicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3621"/>A few minutes only served to put them both in blue water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3622"/>Doubtless the anticipations of the frigate's officers were wrought to the highest pitch of interesting excitement; but they were destined to disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/>My instructions were to advance when the troops on my right should advance, and to report this to the division commander in order that the other brigades should advance in proper time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>In order that I should advance with those on my right, it became necessary for me to move off by the left flank, so as to uncover the ground over which they had to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>This was done as rapidly as the nature of the ground, with its opposing obstacles, stone and plank fences, would admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>A brisk musketry fight for a few minutes followed, when the enemy gave way; not, however, till all save <num value="2">two</num> pieces of a battery that was in the road had been removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>This stronghold of the enemy, together with his batteries, was almost won, when still another line of infantry descended the slope in our front at a double quick to the support of their fleeing comrades and for the defence of the batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>Seeing this contest so unequal, I dispatched my <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> to the division commander to ask that support be sent to my men, but no support came.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3836"/>Dear Sir &mdash; I have had the honor to receive your kind and interesting letter of the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">2d instant</day></dateStruct> and beg you will accept my best thanks for same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/><pb id="p.290" n="290"/></p> 
<p>I have closely examined your several statements in respect to the <rs>Confederate</rs> military forces during the late war, as well as the casualties incident thereto, and I have come to the conclusion, from my general recollection, which those statements have served to enlighten, that they must be regarded as nearly critically correct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>Most of the returns from which you most probably have derived your information, must have passed through the files of my office in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and if reference could be made to all the records of that office, they would, I have no doubt, enable you to give nearly a complete history of the strength and operations of our armies in detail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>The files of that office which could best afford this information were carefully boxed up and taken on our retreat from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 22" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to <placeName reg="Charlotte, Mecklenburg, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013584">Charlotte, North Carolina</placeName>, where they were unfortunately captured, and, as I learn, are now in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, where they are arranged in a separate building, with other records appertaining to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>I presume that by proper management reference might be had to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>Indeed, I had at <num value="1">one</num> time contemplated to make an effort to renew my acquaintance with those records by a personal application to the authorities in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; but I finally abandoned the idea. * * It would afford me much pleasure to furnish you with the information in the tabular form you have suggested, but it would be quite impossible for me to do this without reference to those records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>I can only state from general recollection that during the <num value="2">two</num> last years of the war the monthly returns of our armies received at my office exhibited the present active force in the field nearly <num value="0.5">one-half</num> less than the returns themselves actually called for, on account of absentees by sickness, extra duty, furlough, desertions, and other casualties incident to a campaign life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>These returns were kept with great secrecy, in order to prevent the enemy from becoming acquainted with our weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>Another disadvantage was also felt in the limited number of our suitable weapons of war, and I believe it will be found on examination that the most approved and tried arms in the hands of our troops were captured from the enemy in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>These, and many other incidents of a like nature, if brought to light, would exhibit the greatest disparity between the <num value="2">two</num> opposing forces, if not in the numbers of troops, as you have exhibited in your tables, at least of sufficient importance to satisfy every unprejudiced mind that we were constantly laboring, throughout the contest, under every possible disadvantage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>I perceive by the printed prospectus of the <quote><orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName>,</quote> which you were so kind as to send me, that time must be given in collecting the necessary facts which are to be the basis of this important work before it shall be prepared and given to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3887"/>It is apparent, from all the information I receive, that very few remain who are willing to return at once to the discharge of their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3943"/>Dear Sir &mdash; At your request, I submit the following account of the operations of my regiment at <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1862-05-05"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="5">5th</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3944"/>The disposition of the brigade on the morning of that day was as follows: <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Jenkins,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00299.03421" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,J.,F.,,:1"><surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>' regiment</orgName> (<orgName n="Palmetto Sharpshooters" type="regiment">Palmetto sharpshooters</orgName>) occupied <placeName reg="Fort Magruder">Fort Magruder</placeName>, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">Fourth</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 5">Fifth regiments</orgName> the smaller works on either flank of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3945"/>My own regiment was posted on the edge of the pine grove in rear and to the left of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3946"/>A detachment of it (<num value="2">two</num> companies) were sent to occupy the last redoubt but <num value="1">one</num> on the line of redoubts to the left of <placeName reg="Fort Magruder">Fort Magruder</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3947"/>Feeling some responsibility resting on myself as to this flank, I reported the extreme left redoubt as unoccupied and suggested that I post at least a picket there, but was told that it was in charge of somebody else (cavalry perhaps). I gave myself no more concern about it until it was occupied by <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00299.03422" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,W.,S.,,:1"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s troops, which occupation was announced to me by a cannon ball from the enemy's gun, which passed through my line and buried itself in the embankment of <placeName reg="Fort Magruder">Fort Magruder</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3948"/>My regiment had been withdrawn by <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0120.0054.00299.03423" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> from its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> position and was lying behind <quote> the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3949"/>I reported this dispatch from the enemy (cannon ball), and was ordered by <persName n="Jenkins,Colonel,,,," id="n0120.0054.00299.03424" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,J.,F.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName> to my <quote>original position to repel the attack of the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3950"/></quote> On arriving at my original position, I saw the line of the enemy (<num value="4">four</num> flags and a battery of <num value="6">six</num> guns) advancing on a redoubt immediately in rear of the <num value="1">one</num> occupied by my <num value="2">two</num> companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3951"/>The fort on the extreme left, also, was full of troops huzzaing and waving <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3952"/>No time was to be lost, for if they occupied the redoubt in rear my <num value="2">two</num> companies were inevitably lost; so without orders I left my position at once and advanced on the redoubt towards which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3953"/>the enemy were moving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3954"/>They were nearer to it than we were, but were advancing cautiously; were receiving a minnie occasionally from my companies in the neighboring work, and were evidently a little suspicious and afraid to believe that things were really as: they appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3955"/><pb id="p.300" n="300"/></p> 
<p>All this was to be seen at a glance, and I moved promptly and directly on the redoubt across the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3956"/>My movement had the effect that I expected it to have &mdash; they halted, unlimbered their guns and serenaded us with shot and shell throughout our advance, and on our reaching the work their infantry opened on us as we entered it. They then retired their line to the crest of the hill and formed on both flanks of the work that they had taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3957"/>I extended a line of skirmishers from the redoubt occupied by my troops to some distance into the woods, and remained in this position watching and expecting them for some <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, for I thought that they would surely discover my real strength in a short time and move down on me. I advised <persName n="Jenkins,Colonel,,,," id="n0120.0054.00300.03425" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,J.,F.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName> of my movement and position, and expressed my confidence in being able to hold the <num value="2">two</num> redoubts, but suggested that more troops be sent into the woods on my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3958"/>He sent a detachment of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">Fourth regiment</orgName> to reinforce me, and with it I extended my line of skirmishers still further into the woods on my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3959"/>The enemy, however, did not advance on me; but late in the evening our friends did &mdash; <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00300.03426" reg="nearbymention:Early,J.,A.,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> charged my works from the left and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3960"/>Nobody, either officer or scout, had come to the front to reconnoitre, and they did not even know where the enemy were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3961"/>They charged me (<num value="2">two</num> regiments of them) across the line of the enemy, <num value="1">one</num> regiment against each of the works that my troops occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3962"/>I did not know that they were near until they emerged from the wood on the charge, and seeing their mistake I rushed out to stop them and change their direction before they were exposed to the fire of the enemy; but they would not heed, and on they went until they reached my redoubts, when they for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time learned where the enemy were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3963"/><num value="2">Two</num> of <orgName n="regiments"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00300.03427" reg="nearbymention:Early,J.,A.,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s regiments</orgName> were stopped in the wood and proper direction given to them (the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName> and <orgName n="NC regiment"><persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00300.03428" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,John,H.,,:1"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s North Carolina regiment</orgName>). The <num value="2">two</num> that charged my works were the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC5">Fifth North Carolina</orgName> and a Virginia regiment commanded by <persName n="Early,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0120.0054.00300.03429" reg="nearbymention:Early,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">a Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>--a brother, I was told, of the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3964"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="NC5">Fifth North Carolina</orgName> charged across the entire front of the enemy to the redoubt occupied by my <num value="2">two</num> companies, and on finding it already ours, with scarce a halt, changed direction and advanced most handsomely against the enemy (my <num value="2">two</num> companies joining them in the charge) to within, I think, at least <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of the enemy's line, when they encountered a small fence, partly torn down by the enemy, and unfortunately <pb id="p.301" n="301"/>halted and commenced firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3965"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName> had meanwhile emerged from the wood on the left, nearer to the enemy than my redoubt on which <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00301.03430" reg="nearbymention:Early,J.,A.,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName> charged, and was moving in fine style upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3966"/><orgName n="Early's Regiment"><persName n="Early,Regiment,,,," id="n0120.0054.00301.03431" reg="nearbymention:Early,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="Regiment"></roleName><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="regiment">regiment</orgName></orgName> never recovered from the confusion into which they were thrown by the taking of my works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3967"/>They were formed, however, and started forward, but went obliquely to the left to the wood, and I saw no more of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3968"/>I met <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0120.0054.00301.03432" reg="nearbymention:Early,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> near this redoubt, himself and horse both wounded, and told him that I had checked the enemy, and been there watching him for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, and asked him to give me a place in the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3969"/>He said, <quote>Certainly, go.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>I told him that some of my men were in that fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3971"/>He said, <quote>Take them and go toward the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3972"/>I took my men out of the fort and, moved them all forward into the gap left by the oblique movement of <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00301.03433" reg="nearbymention:Early,J.,A.,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName> into the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3973"/>We advanced to within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the enemy, when we were ordered by <persName n="Hill,General,D.,H.,," id="n0120.0054.00301.03434" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> to move by the left flank into the wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3974"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="NC5">Fifth North Carolina</orgName>, on our right, as I said above, unfortunately stopped and commenced firing; I say unfortunately, because from the confused tangling of their muskets I shall ever believe that the enemy were actually broken (their fire, too, almost ceased), and it only required the continued advance of the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC5">Fifth North Carolina</orgName> to complete their route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3975"/>As it was, the crest of the hill protected the enemy from their fire, and they had time to recover from their panic, and return to the crest, and open fire, which they did, concentrating their overwhelming volleys on the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC5">Fifth North Carolina</orgName>, and almost demolishing it. The <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName> on my left was not in time to engage them simultaneously with the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC5">Fifth North Carolina</orgName>, and also met the concentrated fire of nearly the whole of the enemy's line, but being nearer to cover, did not suffer so terribly in retiring, but were completely used up, thus leaving my regiment advancing alone to share the same fate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3976"/>At this juncture, <persName n="Hill,,D.,H.,," id="n0120.0054.00301.03435" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, who was on the field, and not far from me, ordered me to move by the flank in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3977"/>I moved into the woods, and found a regiment that had not been in action drawn up, and was told that it was <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00301.03436" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,John,H.,,:1"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3978"/>I formed on it, and in a short time it was moved in retreats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/>I found <persName n="Hill,,D.,H.,," id="n0120.0054.00301.03437" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, and asked him if the orders were to retreat &mdash; that the regiment on which I had formed had moved back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>He said that he had given no such orders, but that I had better move <pb id="p.302" n="302"/>with that regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3981"/>We, following this regiment, withdrew from the field, and rejoining my brigade, took the position I had originally occupied in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3982"/>I have never, on any field during the war, seen more splendid gallantry exhibited than on that field of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, but that splendid gallantry was thrown away and wasted by bad management, when it would have been entirely effective if properly directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>This was, I will add, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and last time that I ever asked for a place in a charge &mdash; a pardonable folly, I hope, at that stage of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>The balance of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0120.0054.00302.03438" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,R.,H.,,"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> was in <placeName reg="Fort Magruder">Fort Magruder</placeName> and the works about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>The conduct of the officers and men of the squadron in this contest reflects unfading honor upon themselves and upon the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>The report will be read with deep interest, and its details will not fail to rouse the ardor and nerve the arms of our gallant seamen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>It will be remembered that the <rs>Virginia</rs> was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her heaviest guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and her obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other: and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of <persName n="Buchanan,Flag-Officer,,,," id="n0120.0057.00306.03458" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,Franklin,,,"><roleName n="Flag-Officer">Flag-Officer</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4021"/>To his experience, skill and untiring industry as her Ordnance and Executive Officer, the terrible effect of her fire was greatly due.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>When within less than a mile of the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, the <rs>Virginia</rs> commenced the engagement with that ship with her bow gun, and the action soon became general &mdash; the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, Congress, gunboats and shore batteries concentrating upon us their heavy fire, which was returned with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name> and determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>The Virginia stood rapidly on towards the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, which ship I had determined to sink with our prow, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4029"/>In about <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> after the action commenced we ran into her on her starboard bow; the crash below the water was distinctly heard, and she commenced sinking, gallantly fighting her guns as long as they were above water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4030"/>She went down with her colors flying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4031"/>During this time the shore batteries, Congress and gunboats kept up their heavy concentrated fire upon us, doing us some injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>Our guns, however, were not idle; their fire was very destructive to the shore batteries and vessels, and we were gallantly sustained by the rest of the squadron.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>Just after the <rs>Cumberland</rs> sunk, that gallant <persName n="Tucker,Officer-Commander,John,R.,," id="n0120.0057.00307.03468" reg="default:Tucker,John,R.,,"><roleName n="Officer-Commander">officer Commander</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName> was seen standing down <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> under full steam, accompanied by the <rs>Jamestown</rs> and <rs>Teazer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>They all came nobly into action, and were soon exposed to the heavy fire of shore batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>Their escape was miraculous, as they were under a galling fire of solid shot, shell, grape and canister, a number of which passed through the vessels without doing any serious injury, except to the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs>, through whose boiler a shot passed, scalding to death <num value="4">four</num> persons and wounding others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/><persName n="Barney,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0120.0057.00307.03469" reg="nearbymention:Barney,J.,N.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Barney</surname></persName> promptly obeyed a signal to tow her out of the action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>As soon as damages were repaired, the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> returned <pb id="p.308" n="308"/>to her station and continued to perform good service during the remainder of that day and the following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>Having sunk the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, I turned our attention to the <rs>Congress</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>We were some time in getting our proper position, in consequence of the shoalness of the water, and the great difficulty of managing the ship when in or near the mud. To succeed in my object I was obliged to run the ship a short distance above the batteries on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> in order to wind her. During all this time her keel was in the mud; of course she moved but slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>Thus we were subjected twice to the heavy guns of all the batteries in passing up and down the river, but it could not be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>We silenced several of the batteries, and did much injury on shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>A large transport steamer alongside the wharf was blown up, <num value="1">one</num> schooner sunk and another captured and sent to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>The loss of life on shore we have no means of ascertaining.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>While the <rs>Virginia</rs> was thus engaged in getting her position for attacking the <rs>Congress</rs>, the prisoners state it was believed on board that ship that we had hauled off; the men left their guns and gave <num value="3">three</num> cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>They were soon sadly undeceived, for a few minutes after we opened upon her again, she having run on shore in shoal water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/>The carnage, havoc and dismay caused by our fire compelled them to haul down their colors and to hoist a white flag at their gaff, and half-mast another at the main.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>The crew instantly took to their boats and landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4048"/>Our fire immediately ceased, and a signal was made for the <rs>Beaufort</rs> to come within hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>I then ordered <persName n="Parker,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0120.0057.00308.03470" reg="nearbymention:Parker,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> to take possession of the <rs>Congress</rs>, secure the officers as prisoners, allow the crew to land and burn the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>He ran alongside, received her flag and surrender from <persName n="Smith,Commander,William,,," id="n0120.0057.00308.03471" reg="default:Smith,William,,,"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pendergrast,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0120.0057.00308.03472" reg="mostcommon:Pendergrast,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Pendergrast</surname></persName>, with the side-arms of those officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>They delivered themselves as prisoners of war on board the <rs type="ship">Beaufort</rs>, and afterwards were permitted, at their own request, to return to the <rs>Congress</rs>, to assist in removing the wounded to the <rs>Beaufort</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/>They never returned, and I submit to the decision of the <name>Department</name> whether they are not our prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4053"/>While the <rs>Beaufort</rs> and <rs>Raleigh</rs> were alongside the <rs>Congress</rs>, and the surrender of that vessel had been received from the commander, she having <num value="2">two</num> white flags flying, hoisted by her own people, a heavy fire was opened upon them from the shore and from the <rs>Congress</rs>, killing some valuable officers and men. Under this fire the steamers left the <rs>Congress</rs>; but as I was not informed that any injury had been sustained by those vessels <pb id="p.309" n="309"/>at that time, <persName n="Parker,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0120.0057.00309.03473" reg="nearbymention:Parker,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> having failed to report to me, I took it for granted that my order to him to burn her had been executed, and waited some minutes to see the smoke ascending from her hatches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4054"/>During this delay we were still subjected to the heavy fire from the batteries, which was always promptly returned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4055"/>The steam frigates <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName> and <placeName reg="Roanoke, Roanoke, Virginia" key="tgn,7014343">Roanoke</placeName>, and the sailing <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Saint Lawrence</rs>, had previously been reported as coming from <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>; but as I was determined that the <rs>Congress</rs> should not again fall into the hands of the enemy, I remarked to that gallant young officer, <persName n="Minor,Flag-Lieutenant,,,," id="n0120.0057.00309.03474" reg="mostcommon:Minor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Flag-Lieutenant">Flag-Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Minor</surname></persName>, <quote>that ship must be burned.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>He promptly volunteered to take a boat and burn her, and <rs type="ship">the Teazer</rs>, <persName n="Webb,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0120.0057.00309.03475" reg="nearbymention:Webb,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Webb</surname></persName>, was ordered to cover the boat.

On witnessing this vile treachery, I instantly recalled the boat and ordered the <rs>Congress</rs> destroyed by hot shot and incendiary shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>About this period I was disabled, and transferred the command of the ship to that gallant, intelligent officer, <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,Catesby,,," id="n0120.0057.00309.03477" reg="default:Jones,Catesby,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Catesby</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, with orders to fight her as long as the men could stand to their guns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>The ships from <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> opened their fire upon us. The <rs>Minnesota</rs> grounded in the north channel, where unfortunately the shoalness of the channel prevented our near approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>We continued, however, to fire upon her until the pilots declared that it was no longer safe to remain in that position, and we accordingly returned by the south channel (the middle ground being necessarily between the <rs>Virginia</rs> and <rs>Minnesota</rs>, and <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Saint Lawrence</placeName> and the <rs>Roanoke</rs> having retreated under the guns of <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>), and again had an opportunity of opening upon the <rs>Minnesota</rs>, receiving her heavy fire in return; and shortly afterwards upon the <rs>Saint Lawrence</rs>, from which vessel we also received several broadsides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/>It had by this time become dark and we soon after anchored off <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4062"/>The rest of the squadron followed our movements with the exception of <rs type="ship">the Beaufort</rs>, <persName n="Parker,Lieutenant Commanding,,,," id="n0120.0057.00309.03478" reg="nearbymention:Parker,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant-Commanding</roleName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>, who proceeded to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> with the wounded and prisoners, as soon as he had left the <rs>Congress</rs>, without reporting to me. The Congress, having been set on fire by our hot shot and incendiary shell, continued to burn &mdash; her loaded guns being successively discharged as the flames reached them &mdash; until a few minutes past midnight, when her magazine exploded with a tremendous report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4069"/>The pilots did not place us as near as they expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4070"/>The great length and draft of the ship rendered it exceedingly difficult to work her; we ran ashore about a mile from the frigate and were backing <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> before we got off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4071"/>The pilots declaring that we could get no nearer the <rs>Minnesota</rs> and believing her to be entirely disabled, and the <rs>Monitor</rs> having run into shoal water, which prevented our doing her any further injury, we ceased firing at <num value="12">12</num>, and proceeded to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/><num value="1">One</num> day, a terrible fight was in progress amongst them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>The sentry approached the door, which was an aperture about 4x4, and commanded them to desist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4268"/>A blow on the head with a brick was the answer he received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>An officer came in with a guard of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> men, and as he came in front of the opening he also was felled by a blow on the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>He ordered his men to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>They did so, when the most horrid groans and screams, interspersed with frightful oaths, issued from the opening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4273"/>A few moments afterwards <measure n="1" type="dead">one dead</measure> and several wounded were brought out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4274"/>It was nothing more than natural &mdash; situated, as we were, in a strange land, amongst strangers and enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4275"/>It was while we were here (<placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>) that the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> prisoners were notified that they could either take the oath or submit to the drawing of lots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>Some weak minded ones yielded, but the majority remained firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4279"/>The writer did not know what disposition was made of them, but learned afterwards that they were retained in close confinement during the war, which impaired their health to such a degree that <num value="2">two</num> of them died soon after they came home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4280"/>From our quarters at <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName> we had a delightful view of the city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and suburbs; also of <placeName reg="Fort Marshall">Fort Marshall</placeName>, situated across the bay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/>The famous <orgName type="regiment" key="NY7">New York Seventh regiment</orgName> was stationed here awhile, and was ofter taken by new comers for Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>The dress parade of the garrison, with their fine music, was eagerly anticipated every evening.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4284"/>On the <dateStruct value="-09-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> we embarked on the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">John J.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/>Our number was about <num value="160">one hundred and sixty</num>; consequently we were not much crowded, and the steamer was quite comfortable and clean, being <num value="1">one</num> of the bay boats, and not a Government transport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/><num value="1">One</num> of our number, a Tennessean, died on the passage, and was buried in the bay. Weights were attached to his body, which was placed upon a plank, <num value="1">one</num> end of which was raised, and the <rs>Confederate</rs> passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>The solemn spectacle was witnessed by our men with much emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>He had some friends, no doubt, who informed his command of his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>That night we lay upon the upper deck of the steamer, many of us thinking of the death of the stranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>Accustomed as we had become to death on the battle-field and in hospital, it had lost much of its dread; but this mode of burial was something new, and made a lasting impression upon us. I was somewhat surprised, next morning, to find myself addressed by <num value="1">one</num> of the guard (<orgName type="regiment" key="25NYArtillery">Twenty-fifth New York artillery</orgName>). He proved to be an old schoolmate of mine and a near neighbor, who had been induced to take the oath on account of the drawing previously referred to. He remained North during the war, but not as a soldier, having been detected in some smuggling correspondence and thrown into prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/>He visited his home at the close of the war, but soon enlisted in the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States army</orgName>, and is now stationed in the far <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>Upon arriving at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>, he gave me what money he had, and promised to aid me whenever he could; but he did not have an opportunity afterwards.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>This camp had been but recently established, and there was not many prisoners here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>They yelled to us to <quote>grab your <rs n="pocket books" type="product">pocket-books</rs>,</quote> as we came in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>This referred to the strict search to to which all new comers were subjected, in which everything, even to a few Confederate dollars, was taken from you. It was labelled and put away, to be returned to you when you were leaving; but the valuables were never returned, as they could not be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>We were now regularly initiated as prisoners of war, and began to feel all the rigors and severities of such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>We were divided into companies of <num value="100">one hundred</num> men each, and were allowed for some time to draw and cook our own rations, each company sergeant being supplied with the necessary utensils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>Soon, however, large numbers <pb id="p.327" n="327"/>of prisoners began to arrive, most of them from <placeName key="tgn,2335231" n="1.000 1" reg="Fort Delaware, New Castle, Delaware">Fort Delaware</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>They were in a most destitute and deplorable condition &mdash; many of them not having sufficient clothing to clothe them, and all were without blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>The severity of a winter on this barren place can only be imagined by those who have been there, and our prospects were now gloomy indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>Our camp had formerly been a corn-field, and consisted of about <measure n="50acres" type="area">fifty acres</measure>. The Federal authorities conceived the plan of fencing in the camp, and erecting cook-houses, a commissary, &amp;c., and for this purpose secured the services of several good carpenters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>They employed about <measure n="200" type="prisoners">two hundred prisoners</measure> to assist, paying them in extra rations and tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>When these were erected the camp was thoroughly reorganized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>The men were divided into divisions of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men each &mdash; each under a Yankee sergeant &mdash; and the division into companies of <num value="100">one hundred</num> men each, under a Confederate sergeant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>We were compelled to keep the camp clean, well drained, &amp;c., and for this purpose carts and barrows were furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>Each company street was well drained, and made as hard and firm as pebble and sand could make it. Each drain ran into the main drain, which ran through the centre of the camp, and from which all the refuse water was thrown into the bay. Our tents were miserable affairs, being full of holes, and very rotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>They were of the <quote><persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n0120.0060.00327.03700" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,nomatch:0"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> pattern,</quote> and into each <num value="1">one</num> of these <num value="16">sixteen</num> men were crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>In order to lay down at night, the men were compelled to lay so close together as to exclude sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>The winter of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> was now approaching, and gloom, privation and starvation were staring us in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>On the <dateStruct value="-11-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, snow fell arid there was not a stick of wood in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4311"/>The day was bitter cold, most of us were but poorly clad, and very few of us had shoes of any description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>We were compelled to stand in our damp tents, and <quote>mark time</quote> to keep from freezing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4313"/>This scarcely seems possible, yet it can be attested by hundreds who were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>Previous to this time--<dateStruct value="1863-11-"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>--we had no reason to complain of our rations, but now we began to feel the pangs of hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4315"/>Shortly after the cook houses were finished, a detail of <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> men, under a sergeant, was assigned to each house, whose duty it was to cook the rations and issue them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4316"/>Each house was furnished with <num value="3">three</num> huge boilers &mdash; holding perhaps, <num value="40">forty</num> gallons apiece &mdash; thus enabling them to feed about <num value="500">five hundred</num> men at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/>Our rations were now reduced as follows: for breakfast, half-pint coffee, or, rather, slop water; for dinner, half-pint greasy water (called soup for etiquette), also a small piece of meat, perhaps <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> ounces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4318"/>For bread <pb id="p.328" n="328"/>we were allowed <num value="8">eight</num> ounces per day; this you could press together in your hand and take at a mouthful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>Our water was of such a character that we could scarcely use it, being so highly tinctured with sulphur and iron as to render it almost unbearable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>Clothes which were washed in it were turned black and yellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>To our suffering from the cold and the want of pure water was now added that of hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>To those who have never suffered in this respect, it is almost impossible to describe the sensations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>The writer has known large, stout men to lay in their tents at night and cry like little babies from hunger and cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>We were not allowed to walk about, but were compelled to retire to our tents at <quote>taps,</quote> which were sounded quite early.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4325"/>Even the poor privilege of keeping ourselves warm by walking up and down in front of our tents was denied us, and we were compelled to lay in the cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>The supply of blankets was very scant, and <quote>bunks</quote> were unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>The cold ground was our bed, and pillows we had none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/>To add to our discomforts, the tide from the bay occasionally backed into the camp, and compelled those whose tents had been flooded to stand all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>Midwinter was now upon us, and the intense cold we suffered may be judged when it is stated that the <rs type="place">Chesapeake bay</rs> was frozen hard full <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> from the bank.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>These troops were housed in comfortable tents, and as we saw the smoke rising from the innumerable stove-pipes projecting from their tents, we could not but indulge in bitter thoughts of their cruelty.

He was the impersonation of cruel malignity hatred and revenge, and he never let an opportunity pass in which he could show his disposition in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>Of the guards we could not complain, as they acted under orders and were not responsible for any of the cruelties to which we were subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>As might be inferred, our <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n0120.0060.00328.03704" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName> was a dull <num value="1">one</num>, and we passed the day in thinking of <quote>Dixie</quote> and the loved ones at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>About the <dateStruct value="-01-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, our suffering had grown so intense that a party formed a plan to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>This work was extremely dangerous, and had to be carried on with great caution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/>It was large enough for a man to crawl through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>It was worked by detail, and as the dirt was dug out of it, it was drawn to the mouth of the tunnel in an old haversack, and distributed over the bottom of the tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>At last it was completed, and the party was divided into squads of <num value="10">ten</num> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4344"/>The squads were to make their exit on separate nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4345"/>After getting beyond the inclosure, each party was to choose its own mode of proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> party made the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>They were betrayed by a sentinal, whom some of them had most foolishly bribed, as there was no necessity for it. The alarm was given, and the prisoners who had succeeded in getting out had taken refuge behind the protecting banks of sand on the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>As soon as the officers reached the spot, they called upon the prisoners to surrender, saying they would not be harmed.

The shooting of these men was without any excuse whatever, as they had expressed a willingness to surrender, and were proceeding to do so; besides, it is a recognized principle that a prisoner of war has a right to escape if he can, and the capturing party has no right to punish, but simply to remand to proper custody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>This event stopped all idea of escape for awhile, and we became resigned to our fate.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4816"/>About this time the enemy's line opened fire upon us, but almost at once became discomposed by our advance, and soon broke into retreat; and what seemed to be <num value="1">one</num> regiment, immediately in our front, was thrown into confusion, which increased until it ran into the extreme left redoubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4817"/>While the regiment was passing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> redoubt, I left its line for a few moments to put myself in command of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4819"/>I saw that the enemy was disconcerted, and, if pressed with sufficient force, might be routed; but I saw also the hazard of advancing with so small a force against a superior enemy, with <num value="1">one</num> regiment occupying a redoubt and supported by a formidable battery; for although the body of troops which ran into the redoubt was in confusion, and the others of what seemed to be from the flags <num value="3">three</num> other regiments retreated to the rear of it, yet the battery had been retired en echelon with great precision, and there was no such manifest disorder as would justify storming the redoubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4820"/>So I hurried my Adjutant to <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0120.0067.00370.04200" reg="nearbymention:Hill,D.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, with substantially these instructions: <quote>I am pushing the enemy rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4833"/>I heard the order given in the redoubt <hi rend="italics">to</hi> cease firing, and the appearances indicated there might be a feint to draw me on; but this did not stop the advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4834"/>I felt satisfied that disabled as the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName> was, and disproportioned in numbers as my whole force was, that it would not do to storm the redoubt, supported, as it was, by the battery and <num value="3">three</num> outside regiments; but at the same time I had advanced into the dilemma under orders, and confidently expecting to be supported by the <num value="2">two</num> regiments (especially as the enemy had constantly given back) which had embarked in the attack, and I was not willing to retreat without completing the effort to capture the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/><num value="1">One</num> of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts towards better treatment was to relieve <num value="1">one</num> of the white regiments as a guard, and place in its stead the <orgName type="regiment" key="36NCColored">Thirty-sixth North Carolina colored regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5085"/>This was a severe blow to us. On the <dateStruct value="-02-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> they arrived, accoutred in their military glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/>They were quite a curiosity to many, as they had never, previous to this time, seen any colored troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day they came on guard will long be remembered by every prisoner in the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5088"/>At the usual hour, they marched in with knapsack, haversack and canteen, equipped as for a march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5089"/>They proceeded with military precision to unsling their knapsacks, and place them upon the ground, to mark the ends of their beats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>The main street, along which they were stationed, was crowed with prisoners, all anxious to see the <quote>monkey show.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/>We knew their intense hatred to us, and we were well aware that the slightest demonstration on our part would be used as a pretext for firing into us. Notwithstanding this, some fellow, on mischief bent, deliberately crossed the line, and stole <num value="1">one</num> of their knapsacks, which he tossed into the road, and the dismay and chagrin evinced by this ebony son of <persName n="Mars,,,,," id="n0120.0070.00393.04306" reg="mostcommon:Mars,nomatch:0"><surname>Mars</surname></persName> can be imagined better than described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>After calling in the officer of the guard, he related his story in the following pathetic style: <quote>Fore <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, if I bin here <num value="6">six</num> monts, I never tief anything from dese buckra.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>I wouldn't care, if dey give me back dat garytype.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>Dat's all I wants.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>These are, as near as can be remembered, the exact words he used on the occassion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>He never recovered his knapsack, nor his <quote>garytype,</quote> for it was seen, long afterwards, in the possession of a prisoner, who used all kinds of expedients to keep it concealed, for had he been discovered his life <pb id="p.394" n="394"/>would have paid the forfeit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>A guard of negroes was sent through the camp to search for it, and the manner in which they performed that duty was observable in the number of bleeding heads among the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>They had beat them over the head in order to compel them to tell who did it. For this conduct, their officers praised them, and told them to shoot whenever they felt like doing so, and right well did they obey this order, as will be shown hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>Matters were thus proceeding from bad to worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>The shooting of a prisoner was looked upon as an every day affair, especially when said shooting was done by a negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>The colored troops came on guard only once in <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, and the day of their coming was always dreaded by the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5102"/>In accordance with <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0120.0070.00394.04307" reg="nearbymention:Butler,B.,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s promise, to give us more rations, our meagre supply of coffee was cut off. This was not so much of a deprivation to us as might be supposed, for the coffee was <quote>slop water</quote> in every respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5103"/>Some of the prisoners went so far as to say that the <rs>Commissary</rs> actually shook a small bag of coffee at each kettle (about <num value="40">forty</num> gallons of water). This was a grim joke, but it had much the appearance of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/>Shortly after cutting off the coffee supply, our rations were reduced in other respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/>Bread was issued in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/>The men would eat it as soon as they received it. It does not take much time to consume <num value="8">eight</num> ounces of soft bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>They would then, of course, be without bread until the following afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/>About <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> ounces of meat was given for breakfast, and a cup of greasy water for dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5109"/>Hitherto the sulter had been allowed to sell provisions in limited quantities to those who had the money with which to purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5110"/>This privilege was also abolished, and we were compelled to rely upon the <rs>Government</rs> rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/>As the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officers used every means to induce the prisoners to take the oath, it is fair to presume that the <quote>best Government the sun ever shone upon</quote> was now reduced to the policy of starving men into allegiance to it. There was much work to be done on the outside of the pen, and the prisoners were induced to do it by promise of extra rations and tobacco, and the privilege of getting out every day. There were several of the details, each numbering about <num value="30">thirty</num> men. <num value="1">One</num> was sent to the wharf for the purpose of loading boats, another to the quartermaster's warehouse, &amp;c. The Government never made anything by employing these <quote>rebels,</quote> as they invariably <quote>flanked</quote> more than they received as pay. They were very useful to the men in camp, as by their aid many little comforts and articles of necessity were brought <pb id="p.395" n="395"/>in, when they were not overhauled and stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5112"/>Our spirits were very much rivived, about the <dateStruct value="-03-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, by seeing several paragraphs in the papers relative to the exchange of prisoners, which had been broken up at the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs> by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officers, who flagrantly violated the terms of the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5113"/>This was a most interesting subject to us, especially the <rs>Gettysburg</rs> prisoners, who had been told that they were retained as <quote>nest eggs,</quote> and that they would have no more fighting to do. On the <dateStruct value="-03-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, the <orgName type="division" n="division 1">First division</orgName> left for Dixie, and the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num>, the <orgName type="division" n="division 9">Ninth division</orgName>, and on the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">17th</day></dateStruct>, <num value="5">five</num> companies of the <orgName type="division" n="division 2">Second division</orgName> left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5114"/>We now began to regard an early return to the sunny <rs>South</rs> with some certainty, and many were the plans laid out for amusement and fun upon our arrival at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5115"/>These were all, however, doomed to bitter disappointment, as the next week brought us the news that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0120.0070.00395.04308" reg="nearbymention:Butler,B.,F.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s plan of <quote>swapping man for man</quote> would not work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5116"/>We now began to look forward to the termination of the war as the only end to our captivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5117"/>On the <dateStruct value="-04-23"><day reg="23">23d</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-04-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, <num value="2">two</num> boat loads of sick were taken off. Shortly after this our situation began to get worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5118"/>Warm weather was approaching, the camp was crowded, and hospital accommodations were very poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5119"/>The water, which could be used in the winter in moderate quantities only, was now in such a condition as to be totally unfit for use. In <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, large numbers of the wounded from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0120.0070.00395.04309" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> were brought to the hospitals, situated on the point outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5120"/>This water was used to wash their wounds, and gangrene made its appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5121"/>They were compelled to send to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> for water, and it was brought in casks which had formerly contained vinegar, liquors of all description, and even oil. Our number now had increased to about <num value="15000">15,000</num> men, and we had a city of tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5122"/>The health of the men began to fail rapidly, and soon the prisoners' hospital was crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5123"/>Fever in every shape abounded, and smallpox was epidemic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5124"/>Nearly every tent contained <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> of this loathsome disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5125"/>It had become so common, that prisoners did not fear it. The hospital could not accommodate all the sick, and they were left in their tents, many of them with a blanket only to protect them from the damp ground, and entirely destitute of proper nourishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5126"/>Men who were seen in the morning, apparently in health, were taken to the <quote><placeName reg="Dead house">Dead house</placeName></quote> in the afternoon, and some have been known to drop in the street, and die before they could be carried to the tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5127"/>Notwithstanding the enforcement of the most rigid sanitary measures, diseases of all kinds continued to <pb id="p.396" n="396"/>spread with an alarming rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5128"/>Add to this the short rations which were meted out to us, together with their miserable quality and the cruel treatment which we received at the hands of the negro soldiers, and you have but a faint idea of the suffering to which we were now subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5129"/>Fears of death, either by disease or the hands of the negroes, forced many true Southern soldiers to think of taking the oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5130"/>This could readily be done, by application to the proper authorities, and a released obtained &mdash; only, however, to be drafted in the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5131"/>An opportunity to take the oath, and go into the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States army</orgName>, was now freely extended to all the prisoners, as the officials gave notice that a <quote>drawing for hostages in retaliation for the <rs>Fort Pillow</rs> massacre</quote> was to take place at some early day. Preparations were accordingly made, and finally the <dateStruct value="-05-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> was announced as the day upon which to determine the fate of many men. The <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi> took remarkably well, and some <num value="100">hundred</num> or so flocked to the gate, to swear fealty to <quote><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5132"/>After this furor oath-taking was not so prevalent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5133"/>Later in the summer, it again made its appearance, and this time the prisoners determined to take action to prevent it. This, however, had to be done with great secrecy, as the participators in it, if known, would have been severely punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5134"/>Meetings were held in the tents of the most prominent men in camp, and various schemes devised to prevent the depletion of our ranks in this manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5135"/>None of them had any effect, however, and more vigorous measures had to be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5136"/>Whenever it was known that a prisoner intended taking the oath (and it was very difficult to conceal the matter from his tent mates), a party would proceed to his tent the night previous, call him out and administer a severe flogging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5137"/>They even went so far as to clip off the ears of <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5138"/>Of course the parties who did this work were completely disguised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5139"/>Thus it will be seen that Kuklux existed at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName> before it did in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5140"/>The enforcement of these harsh measures decreased the number of oath-takers very materially, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were compelled to seek elsewhere for recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5141"/>Summer was now fairly upon us, and we began to feel its effects most severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5142"/>There was not a shade tree in the camp, and the only shelter we had from the scorching rays of the sun was our dilapidated tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5143"/>The glare of the sun upon the white ground and tents soon produced what is known as <quote>moon blindness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>This is a disease which affects <num value="1">one</num> only at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5145"/>Then <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the camp, at least, were totally blind, and had to be led <pb id="p.397" n="397"/>by those who were more fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5146"/>Their fear that this might terminate in total and permanent blindness was a source of extreme .anxiety to most of the men, and began to tell most fearfully upon their health and spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5147"/>Nothing was done by the authorities (if, indeed, anything could have been done) except the issuing of green shades for the eyes, and planting some small spots with oats, rye, &amp;c., so that the eye might have a green spot to look upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5148"/>The health of the camp began to grow worse, and deaths were very numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>Very little has been said so far as to the treatment which we received, and a few words on that subject would not be amiss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>As a general rule, the treatment by the white soldiers was not so bad, and it would have been much better, no doubt, had it not been for the cruel policy of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>, and the stringent orders to have that policy carried out. Our guards were relieved every morning, and fresh ones were mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>A patrol of <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> men was placed in the camp, whose duty it was to see that the prisoners retired to their tents at the proper hour and extinguished their lights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5152"/>Their orders were to allow no <num value="1">one</num> to walk about after <quote>taps</quote> were sounded, nor to allow any unnecessary noise or conversation in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5153"/>The colored troops were very harsh in their treatment of us, and they were no doubt urged to do this by their officers, who were certainly the meanest set of white men that could be found anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/>The negroes never let an opportunity pass to show their animosity and hatred towards us, and the man who shot a Rebel was regarded as a good soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>They carried their authority to the extreme, and would shoot upon the slightest provocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>If a prisoner happened to violate even <num value="1">one</num> of the simplest regulations, he was sure to be shot at, and should he be so unfortunate as to turn over in his sleep, groan or make any noise, which some were apt to do while sleeping, the tent in which he lay would be fired into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>For instance, <num value="1">one</num> night in <orgName type="company" n="Company G">Company G</orgName>, <orgName type="division" n="division 4">Fourth division</orgName>, some <num value="1">one</num> happened to groan in his sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>The negro patrol was near, heard it, and fired into the tent, killing <num value="2">two</num> and wounding several others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5159"/>These were killed while sleeping and were unconscious of having committed any offence whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5160"/>None of the patrols were punished, but were praised for vigilance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5161"/>Scores of incidents, similar in character and result, might be given, but it would only be consuming time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5162"/>Suffice it to say that a man's life was in more danger than upon a picket line, for he was completely at the mercy of the cruel and malignant negro soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>Even the white troops were incensed against them, <pb id="p.398" n="398"/>and often <quote>rocked</quote> them while walking their posts &mdash; an act for which the prisoners were blamed, and for which they were fired into on more than <num value="1">one</num> occassion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/>Shooting into the tents of prisoners became so common that the officers of the white regiments protested at last against their (the colored troops) being allowed in camp, and accordingly they were withdrawn at night, and white patrols substituted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5165"/>Desertions among the guard were of a frequent occurrence, and they often carried prisoners with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5166"/><num value="1">One</num> night, a sharp firing was heard on the bay shore, and next morning the bodies of severel Confederates and <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> were seen lying upon the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/><num value="1">One</num> boat load had made good their escape, but this was detected and fired into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>The prison pen was so closely guarded that it was almost impossible to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>In addition to the strong guard maintained around the pen, a block house, with a barricade, extended across the point about a mile from our quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/>Gunboats were constantly patrolling the bay and river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>To go up the point was impossible, as the barricade was strongly guarded, and the <rs>Virginia</rs> shore was <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> from us, while the eastern shore of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> was <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles distant</measure>. Notwithstanding these disadvantages some few managed to get away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5772"/>Its loss was occasioned by a combination of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/>It was commenced in the absence of correct intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5774"/>It was continued in the effort to overcome the difficulties by which we were surrounded, and it would have been gained could <num value="1">one</num> determined and united blow have been delivered by our whole line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/>Nearly the whole loss that our army sustained during the battle arose from the pursuit of the repulsed Federal columns into the plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>To have advanced the whole army into the plain for the purpose of attacking <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n0120.0077.00446.04808" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, would have been to have insured its destruction by the fire from the continued line of guns on the <rs type="place">Stafford hills</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6316"/>A great article of trade, crochet needles, was turned out by lathes made for that purpose; so also were pen handles, bodkins, &amp;c. In fact, every little article needed could be made in our canvass city, even to the ingeniously constructed tools with which the men worked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6317"/>There were the tailors, shoemakers, wash-men, barbers, &amp;c. We also bad eating houses with very little to eat in them; but you could get a good cup of coffee and a piece of fried rat for <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure>. This may seem a joke, but rats were eaten and with much gusto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6318"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> engine made in camp excited much curiosity and wonder among the prisoners, and was visited by a large number of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6319"/>It was indeed a curiosity, and a description of it may not be out of place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6320"/>The boiler was made from an old camp kettle, the mouth of which was plugged up with wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6321"/>The pistons and connecting rods were made of wood, and the valves and heads were contrived from old mustard boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6322"/>It does not seem possible that this could be done, yet it was, and the machines were of sufficient power to drive turning lathes, from which pen handles, bodkins, &amp;c., were turned out. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these wonderful machines was made by a Georgian, who could neither read nor write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6323"/>In a short while there were <num value="7">seven</num> of them in different parts of the camp, and as they would whistle every morning previous to commencing work, it reminded <num value="1">one</num> of the machine shops in large cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6324"/>Another remarkable curiosity was a clock, the works of which were made completely of bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6325"/>When it was completed, it was placed inside of a Confederate canteen, and was exhibited to any <num value="1">one</num> who wished to see it for a cracker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6326"/>It would be an endless task to enumerate the many little curious and ingenious articles which could be seen about the camp; but it must be remembered that among <num value="14000">fourteen thousand</num> or <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men there must necessarily be some of ability and ingenuity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6327"/>Many of them were good writers, and the daily bulletins posted in different parts of the camp attested the fact that they had been accustomed to writing for the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6328"/>There were portrait and landscape painters, and many fine pictures were produced there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6329"/><num value="1">One</num>, <title>The prisoner's Dream of home,</title> was greatly admired and coveted by many, but money could not purchase it from the owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6330"/>The <pb id="p.488" n="488"/>officers would frequently purchase articles from the prisoners, but they could not pay them in money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6331"/>They would give pass-books to the sutler, upon which you were credited to the amount agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6332"/>As you could not purchase eatables from the sutler, this mode of trading did not suit the prisoners; and here the <quote>Detailers</quote> from the camp were of great value to us. They would take out rings, chains, &amp;c., and dispose of them for greenbacks to the runners on the boats plying between <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6333"/>These runners were great speculators in these little trinkets, which were readily bought by the citizens of the <num value="2">two</num> cities, who sympathized with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6334"/>There was quite a manufactory of wooden-ware, such as tubs, buckets, piggins and pails, carried on in the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6335"/>These were made of cracker-boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6336"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> often wondered at the ingenuity and fertility of the prisoners, for they did not imagine that there was much of it among a parcel of Southern soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6337"/>Many a prisoner learned to read and write, for we had a fine school here, under the immediate control of a <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6338"/>About <num value="600">six hundred</num> scholars attended, and books were furnished liberally by the <orgName n="Christian Commission" type="commission">Christian Commission</orgName> and ladies in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6339"/>Of course, in order to get through with so many, different hours were set apart for different recitations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6340"/>There were <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> teachers, whose names cannot be remembered now. All the primary branches were taught, as well as those of an advanced character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6341"/>An old dilapidated cook-house was set apart as a school-room during the week, and as a place of worship on <date value="--7">Sundays</date>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6342"/>The <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday-school</orgName> was large and flourishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6343"/>We had divine worship nearly every <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, conducted either by the prisoners, or by some preachers from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6344"/>The music at the <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday-school</orgName> was always a subject of comment and praise, and it was really of a fine quality, for there were some fine teachers of vocal music attached to the school, and they had large classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6345"/>The prayer meetings in different parts of the camp was quite a feature also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6346"/>There was a large class engaged in the study of phonography, and many of them, no doubt, made good reporters, as they were quite proficient at the time they left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6347"/>While these good features were very prominent, there were also many bad ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6348"/>Gambling houses were very numerous, and the beach during the day presented a strange appearance, as the gambling booths were arranged in perfect order and were always crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6349"/>They were generally decorated by a small, fancy-colored streamer flying from the top, and under them games of every kind were always in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6350"/><pb id="p.489" n="489"/>Cards, monte, roulette, keno, faro, chuck-a-luck, and, in fact, every game of chance known, was freely indulged in. Greenbacks and Confederate money were both legal, and passed at the regular rates of exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6351"/>It is strange that the authorities allowed this, yet they did. Various kinds of currency were in circulation, the principal of which was <quote>hard tack</quote> and tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6352"/>With a hard tack you could purchase a chew of tobacco, or <hi rend="italics">vice versa</hi>. Some men followed this business regularly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6353"/>Whenever any <num value="1">one</num> wanted a chew of tobacco, he could cry out, <quote>Here's your hard tack for your tobacco.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6354"/>Immediately some <num value="1">one</num> would answer, <quote>Here's your tobacco,</quote> and this would apply to anything which might be wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6355"/>It was only necessary to cry out the fact, and the article required could generally be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6356"/>It would have amused any <num value="1">one</num>, not accustomed to it, to have heard this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6357"/>The <rs type="place">Chesapeake bay</rs> afforded a fine opportunity for bathing, and we were allowed to enjoy this privilege <num value="2">two</num> evenings in each week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6358"/>The distance to which we were allowed to go was marked by bouys, but the filthy condition of the bay often precluded many from enjoying this sport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6359"/>A negro sentry, while watching the men bathing <num value="1">one</num> hot afternoon, fell off the parapet and broke his neck.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6360"/>The carelessness of the negroes in handling their arms was notorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6361"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, in looking at the <measure n="1" type="prisoners">prisoners one</measure> day while bathing, placed his chin upon the muzzle of his musket, and rested his foot upon the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6362"/>His foot slipped, the gun was discharged, and blew off the front part of his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6363"/>They would often endeavor to show their dexterity and skill with the musket before the prisoners, and, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, <num value="1">one</num> was shot and killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6364"/>The summer had now passed away and we were still on this desolate spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6365"/>More <quote>Exchange news</quote> became rife, and our spirits became bouyant again, but only to sink again, for only <num value="1">one</num> boat load was taken off. We saw that we were doomed to spend another winter in prison, and with our experience of the previous <num value="1">one</num> we began to make preparation to meet it. We made brick as well as we could, and dried them in the sun, and put our tents in a more comfortable condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6366"/>Some were enabled to purchase empty cracker-boxes from the commissary and build themselves little huts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6367"/>But these were limited in capacity, and rendered somewhat uncomfortable by the restrictions placed upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6368"/>The authorities would occasionally tear them down to see that nothing contraband was in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6369"/>Our treatment had not improved; on the contrary, it grew more severe, and the cruelty of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officials towards <pb id="p.490" n="490"/>us seemed to know no bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6370"/>Every day or <num value="2">two</num> fresh orders were issued forbidding some privileges and abridging others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6371"/>It would be a very difficult matter to describe our sufferings and privations during this terrible winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6372"/>Hunger and cold again forced many to forswear allegiance to the <quote>stars and bars</quote> and enlist under the flag of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6373"/>All who did so were formed in a regiment of cavalry and sent to the <rs>Western</rs> frontier, and very many of them, as soon as an opportunity presented itself, deserted and returned to their native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6374"/>Nothing of importance occurred this winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6375"/>In the month of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, another boat load was taken from camp and sent to Dixie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6376"/>This had occurred so often that it did not affect us much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6377"/>About this time our suffering grew so intense from hunger and cold, that it did not seem possible for us to endure it. But the hope of seeing our dear old Dixie cheered us up, and the meeting with the loved ones at home was uppermost in every man's thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6378"/>On the <dateStruct value="-02-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> an unusual commotion was observed near the main entrance into the camp, and shortly after an order was posted on the bulletin board bidding the <rs>Gettysburg</rs> prisoners to hold themselves in readiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6379"/>With fear and trepidation we proceeded to obey the order, for we did not know what disposition was to be made of us. We were taken into a pen adjacent to the <num value="1">one</num> we had occupied for the past <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure>, and there we received the joyful intelligence that we were to be paroled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6380"/>Several days were consumed in the process, and the night of the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th</day></dateStruct>, at <time value="2am">2 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6381"/>At daybreak on the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> we were well underway, and the place of our long and cruel captivity was fast receding from view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6382"/>At <time value="12pm">noon</time>, at that day, we passed Rip Raps, a barren rock where some of our gallant boys had been sent for some imaginary offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6383"/>A severe gale delayed our progress very materially, and the ice in <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.170 000000.3409	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.170 000000.3409	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName> was another obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6384"/>We had passed the grim walls of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, and began to realize familiar scenes and places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6385"/>About noon, on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="2">15th</day></dateStruct>, we arrived at <placeName reg="Varina Ferry">Varina Ferry</placeName>, and were immediately transferred to our own boats, under the command of that courteous officer and gentleman, <persName n="Hatch,Captain,,,," id="n0120.0080.00490.05511" reg="mostcommon:Hatch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hatch</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6386"/>The officers of the boat had some difficulty in keeping the men in their proper places, for the river was full of torpedoes, and the boats had to be piloted very carefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6387"/>At <time value="4pm">4 P.

The merchants near the wharf opened boxes of tobacco for us, and gave us bountifully of it. It would be difficult <pb id="p.491" n="491"/>to imagine a more joyful party, and the <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">Provost Guard</orgName> experienced much difficulty in maintaining order along the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6388"/>By night we were all housed at Parole camp or in some of the hotels, and in a few days were furloughed to go to our homes and loved ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6389"/>Thus ended our captivity, which will never be forgotten by those who were unfortunate enough to be compelled to participate in it. But there is no cloud, however dark, without a silver lining, and the many friendships formed during our long imprisonment will last till life shall end. Our parting was trying, for it was sundering the ties which had been formed during months of suffering and privation, but we were consoled by the thought that we were soon to meet our loved ones at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6975"/>We must take into consideration the material he had to handle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6976"/>The blunders that were made by the cavalry arose from a want of concert between the cavalry commanders, and a want of thorough discipline, and this latter in a great measure was caused by the fact that you could not exact of men rigid compliance with orders when they were rarely supplied with what they were entitled to receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6977"/>Another cause, not often considered or reflected upon, was that the cavalry furnished at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> their own horses, and were required subsequently <pb id="p.524" n="524"/>to furnish their own horses <hi rend="italics">at their own expense</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6978"/>When a horse is not fed, and given no time to rest, and forced in the charge, <hi rend="italics">or on a raid</hi>, and forced in the retreat, he cannot perform his duty, and the man upon his back has to bear the censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6979"/>A spavined or <hi rend="italics">jammed</hi> horse, or when wounded, cannot carry a sound or an impetuous man. A dead horse cannot be replaced without money, which the man could not procure and the <rs>Government</rs> failed to supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6983"/>You order him to go into battle: his regiment is ordered off at a trot, a gallop; it is impossible for him to go. The more gallant he is, the worse he naturally feels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6984"/>It is simply impossible for him to go. (His only chance is to scout and capture a picket or a straggler). How is he to get away?--<quote><hi rend="italics">run the gauntlet</hi>,</quote> or he is forced into another arm of the service against his will.
