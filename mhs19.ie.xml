<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>For although I have never become the scholar I set out to be, in the midst of the practical industry of a modern minister I have always kept, or wanted to keep, the scholar's attitude, which was what <persName n="DeLong,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00020.00160" reg="nearbymention:DeLong,Henry,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>DeLong</surname></persName> had done through all the long years of his ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>And as I came to know him better I knew how the departure from it on the part of many fellow ministers troubled him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Another thing appealed to me and that was his spiritual quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>But here at least was a man, a Unitarian minister, of a distinctively spiritual, even also evangelical <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00020.00161" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName> <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> temper, in the broad sense of the word evangelical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Some years ago, at the time of the <rs>Chapman</rs> revival meetings in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, I was very desirous that special union gospel meetings of all the <rs type="place">Protestant churches</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 7" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> might be held in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>To do this, the basis of union would have to be simple and broad, and I thought that if we could just preach the gospel of discipleship to <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> as the essential call of Christianity, leaving out the various merely theological notations, we could all get together with <num value="1">one</num> accord in <num value="1">one</num> place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>And it seemed to me that the whole community must hear and heed this kind of an appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>I voiced this thought of mine in the local papers, and I knew that <persName n="DeLong,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00021.00162" reg="nearbymention:DeLong,Henry,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>DeLong</surname></persName> was greatly interested in it and would have co-operated, as would have <persName n="Eaton,Reverend,,,," id="n0334.0004.00021.00163" reg="nearbymention:Eaton,Clarence,L.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev. Mr.</roleName> <surname>Eaton</surname></persName> of the <orgName n="Universalist Church" type="church">Universalist Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>But alas it was not to be, and our evangelistic services, when they came, were of the old divisive kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>But I speak of this merely to show <persName n="DeLong,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00021.00164" reg="nearbymention:DeLong,Henry,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>DeLong</surname></persName>'s broad <name>Christian</name> sympathy and his really evangelical feeling.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Closely akin to this spiritual quality of his life was his reverence for <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man. He approached Deity always in the spirit of vast awe, and was also respectful of the soul of a fellow-man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>You could never think of him as trying to ram the gospel down the throat of a man, as I have often seen it done by ministers and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>I well recall his introductory address to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>How unusually filled with awe were his words!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>He would not even lead in public prayer on an instant's notice, as so many ministers are obliged to do, and which so often develops the easy pious phrases and formal, almost superficial speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/><persName n="DeLong,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00021.00165" reg="nearbymention:DeLong,Henry,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>DeLong</surname></persName> wanted to know beforehand, to be prepared in mood and word, as indeed every minister has the right to do, before addressing the <name>Deity</name> in public prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>But in his case it was entirely in keeping with his reverent mind and sincere temper, without possible pretense or cant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>But I must pass from this more personal appreciation of my friend and colleague to speak of what I think he <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> was to the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>As a church minister <persName n="De,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00022.00166" reg="mostcommon:De,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>De</surname></persName>-Long's term of office was comparable to that of <num value="2">two</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> ministers who served the old town of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> from <dateStruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></dateStruct>, when there was but the <num value="1">one</num> colonial church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>For <persName n="Turell,,Ebenezer,,," id="n0334.0004.00022.00167" reg="default:Turell,Ebenezer,,,"><foreName>Ebenezer</foreName> <surname>Turell</surname></persName> was pastor for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> and <placeName reg="David Osgood">David Osgood</placeName> for <measure n="48years" type="date">forty-eight years</measure>, with <persName n="DeLong,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00022.00168" reg="nearbymention:DeLong,Henry,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>DeLong</surname></persName> <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure>. So also he inherited the traditions of a general ministry, which for over a century made his church the <num value="1">one</num> religious center, with the whole community as its parish and with all the tax payers contributing to its support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>And <persName n="DeLong,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00022.00169" reg="nearbymention:DeLong,Henry,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>DeLong</surname></persName> was earnest and intelligent in his community interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> as a minister of religion, bringing the consolations of <name>Christian</name> faith to many people irrespective of any church connections, and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> as a citizen, serving the public for many years on the <rs>Public Library Board</rs> and in other ways.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>While not active in the political life of the city, as usually becomes the wisdom of a minister, yet he was always influencing that life by the preaching and the support of high political principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>As a descendant of French Huguenot stock, he inherited its independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Sometimes this independence led him to a definiteness of mind and attitude that could be called stubborn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>But <num value="1">one</num> could but believe he tried <q direct="unspecified">to see clear and think straight,</q> to use his own descriptive words about the <name>Puritans</name>, in an address given at the <num value="275" type="ordinal">two hundred and seventy-fifth</num> anniversary of the founding of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 7" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>He was bound to no rigid creed either of religion or politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Nor did his age make him inflexible as to methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>During these later years, when younger and more physically vigorous men came into the pastorates of the various churches, he was yet interested with them in any proposed ways of bettering the community life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>And he kept alive to this contemporary life up to the very last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>It was characteristic of him that age did not relegate him to the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Indeed, he seldom dwelt upon the past, his interest was in current events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>And when men saw him at the polling place or in the civic meeting, they knew <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> he was there as a citizen, not of <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> back, but of the very day; not a resident of old <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 7" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, but a dweller in the present city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>As to his work as the pastor of a given <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName>, others are more competent to speak than am I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>But full testimony was given as to the quality of that ministry at the time of his resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It was essentially a ministry of the faithful and quiet and gentlemanly sort, unobtrusive and unsensational.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>I doubt not some felt it lacked certain aggressive qualities which make an institution <q direct="unspecified">go</q> with a swing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>There is this ever incessant demand for a pusher in the ecclesiastical as in the business world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>But here was a man who, as has been already said, kept to certain old ideals of the <rs>Christian</rs> ministry, being born and bred in the days before <hi rend="italics">push</hi> became the keyword of all human enterprise, when men of the prophetic word took time to think and brood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>And some of us are glad of it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>For <persName n="DeLong,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00023.00170" reg="nearbymention:DeLong,Henry,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>DeLong</surname></persName> was made thereby a dignified and serious teacher of religion, a prophet of the <name>Word</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, an interpreter of human faith, which after all is more needed than a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class religious hustler.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It was rather characteristic of the man, moreover, that only a few hours before his death, when he felt a little brighter, he called for his glasses and the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Atlantic monthly" type="newspaper">Atlantic Monthly</orgName></hi>. Here was the man of letters, the understanding and appreciative reader of the best in literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>And this was aways evidenced by the literary quality of his sermons and their solid output.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/><persName n="DeLong,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00023.00171" reg="nearbymention:DeLong,Henry,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>DeLong</surname></persName> was not what is called in these days a <q direct="unspecified">popular preacher,</q> and could not be. That kind of a preacher is made of different stuff, and sometimes behold what stuff!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Our friend's sermons were products of mental industry, and required mental industry by the hearer in return, a thing, after all, greatly to be desired now, when the preacher's task seems to be to serve up his provender after the manner of the quicklunch counter, and even predigested.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>So in these different ways, as minister of religion, as <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> honorable citizen, and man of letters, this man's life and public influence for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> in a single community is noteworthy, and deserves the full meed of praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>And as for the more personal facts of friendship and kinship, and the precious ties embraced therein, there are many hearts that will cherish him in the silent chambers of love and grateful memory. </p><closer><signed><persName n="Butler,,George,M.,," id="n0334.0004.00024.00172" reg="default:Butler,George,M.,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName>  <surname>Butler</surname></persName>.</signed></closer></body></text> </p></div2></div1>

<p><emph>I</emph> have thought it proper to call the attention of the members of the <rs>Medford</rs> <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName>, and through them the public, to the numerous errors concerning the early history of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 7" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> that may be found in <persName n="Brooks,Mister,Charles,,," id="n0334.0006.00025.00193" reg="default:Brooks,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>' history, with which most of our members are familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>I have, in this paper, made brief quotations from that history, and have endeavored to show wherein they are erroneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>I have been careful in pointing out these errors to correct only such as can be readily proved to be erroneous, and where this cannot be readily proved, to give such reasons for my disagreement as will appeal to my readers as good <hi rend="italics">arguments</hi>, even if they fail to convince.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>I have taken great interest in the early history of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 7" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>; my forebears, like those of <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0006.00025.00194" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, were among the early landholders of the plantation.
