<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Nothing is farther from the present writer's wish than to pander to any petty national vanity, his sole desire being to assist in creating a modest and reasonable self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It was the fashion of earlier critics to pity him for having been born into a country without a past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>What did he mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><pb id="p.3" n="3"/></p> 
<p>There are some things which it is very certain that he did not mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He certainly did not accept the <rs>Matthew Arnold</rs> attitude, that to talk of a distinctive American press at all is an absurdity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><persName n="Arnold,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00003.00009" reg="nearbymention:Arnold,Matthew,,,"><surname>Arnold</surname></persName> finds material for profound ridicule in the fact that there exists a <q direct="unspecified">Primer of American Literature;</q> this poor little Cinderella, cut off from all schooling, must not even have a primer of her own. <persName n="Irving,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00003.00010" reg="nearbymention:Irving,Washington,,,"><surname>Irving</surname></persName> certainly did not assume the (<persName n="Smith,,Goldwin,,," id="n0267.0002.00003.00011" reg="default:Smith,Goldwin,,,"><foreName>Goldwin</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> attitude, that this nation is itself but a schism, and should be viewed accordingly; as if <num value="1">one</num> should talk of there being only a schism between an oak-tree and its seedling, and should try to correct the unhappy separation by trowel and gardener's wax. He certainly did not accept the theory sometimes so earnestly advocated among us, of a <q direct="unspecified">cosmopolitan tribunal,</q> which always turns out to mean a tribunal where all other nations are to be admitted to the jury-box, while <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> is to get no farther than the prisoners' dock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName n="Irving,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00003.00012" reg="nearbymention:Irving,Washington,,,"><surname>Irving</surname></persName> would have made as short work with such a cosmopolitan tribunal as did <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> in Wonderland with the jury-box of small quadrupeds, when she refused to obey <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> the king's order that all persons over a mile high should leave the court-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In truth, the tone of <persName n="Irving,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00004.00013" reg="nearbymention:Irving,Washington,,,"><surname>Irving</surname></persName>'s remark carries us back, by its audacious self-reliance, to the answer said to have been given by the <name>Delphic</name> oracle to <persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00004.00014" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,M.,T.,,:1"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName> in his youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>What could he have meant?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>What is this touchstone that the <rs>American</rs> press must apply to the history and the thought of the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The touchstone, I should unhesitatingly reply, of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>; or rather, perhaps, of those <num value="5">five</num> opening words into which the essence of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> was concentrated; the <num value="5">five</num> words within which, as <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00004.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> said, <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00004.00018" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> embodied an eternal truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><q direct="unspecified">All men are created equal;</q> &mdash;that is, equally men, and each entitled to be counted and considered as an individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><pb id="p.5" n="5"/></p> 
<p>From this simple assumption flowed all that is distinctive in <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>From it resulted, as a political inference, universal suffrage; that is, a suffrage constantly tending to be universal, although it still leaves out <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>This universal suffrage is inevitably based on the doctrine of human equality, as further interpreted by <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>'s remark that the poor man has an equal right to the suffrage with the rich man, <q direct="unspecified">and more need,</q> because he has fewer ways in which to protect himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But it is not true, as even such acute <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> observers as <persName n="Scherer,,M.,,," id="n0267.0002.00005.00019" reg="default:Scherer,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Scherer</surname></persName> and <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> <placeName key="tgn,7007515" n="1.000 1232" reg="maine">Maine</placeName> assume, that <q direct="unspecified">democracy is but a form of government;</q> for democracy has just as distinct a place in society, and, above all, in the realm of literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The touchstone there applied is just the same, and it consists in the essential dignity and value of the individual man. The distinctive attitude of the <rs>American</rs> press must lie, if anywhere, in its recognition of this individual importance and worth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <num value="5">five</num> words of <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00005.00020" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>&mdash;words, which <persName n="Arnold,,Matthew,,," id="n0267.0002.00005.00021" reg="default:Arnold,Matthew,,,"><foreName>Matthew</foreName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName> pronounced <q direct="unspecified">not solid,</q> thus <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> prove themselves solid enough to sustain not merely the government of <num value="63000000">sixty-three million</num> people, but their literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>That poem was not written for a few cultivated people only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I heard it read to an armed regiment of freed slaves, standing silent with dusky faces, with the solemn arches of the live oaks above them, each tree draped with long festoons of gray moss across its <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure> of shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>And never reader had an audience more serious, more thoughtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>And all of that early transcendental school which did so much to emancipate and nationalize American literature, did it by recognizing this same fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>From the depth of their so-called idealism they recognized the infinite value of <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> the individual man. <persName n="Thoreau,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00009.00032" reg="mostcommon:Thoreau,H.,D.,,:1"><surname>Thoreau</surname></persName>, who has been so incorrectly and even cruelly described as a man who spurned his fellows, wrote that noble sentence, forever refuting such critics, <q direct="unspecified">What is nature, without a human life passing within her?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>And now that this early ideal movement has passed by, the far wider movement which is establishing American fiction, not in <num value="1">one</num> locality alone, but on a field broad as the continent, unconsciously recognizes this <num value="1">one</num> principle,&mdash; the essential dignity and worth of the individual man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Not that <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0267.0002.00010.00039" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Walter,,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> did not appreciate with the keenest zest his own Jeannie Deanses and Dandie Dinmonts, but they must keep their place; it is not human nature they vindicate, but peasant virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><pb id="p.11" n="11"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>There is, no doubt, something to be said in defence of respect for authority, but everything depends upon the selection of the source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>nothing strikes an American more, on his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, than the frequent discussion of American authors who are rarely quoted at home, except in stumpspeeches, and whose works hardly have a place as yet in our literary collections, and who still are taken seriously among educated persons in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The astonishment increases when he finds the almanacs of <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Billings,,Josh,,," id="n0267.0016.00128.00569" reg="default:Billings,Josh,,,"><foreName>Josh</foreName> <surname>Billings</surname></persName></q> reprinted in <q direct="unspecified">Libraries of American Humor,</q> and given an equal place with the writings of <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0267.0016.00128.00570" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,Wendell,,,:1"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0267.0016.00128.00571" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,J.,R.,,:1"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Finally he is driven to the conclusion that there must be very little humor in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where things are seriously published in book form which here would only create a passing smile in the corner of a newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>He finds that the whole department of American humor was created, so to speak, by the amazed curiosity of Englishmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>It is a phrase that <num value="1">one</num> rarely hears in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> if we have such a thing among us, although it may cling to our garments, we are habitually as unconscious of it as are smokers of the perfume of their favorite weed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>When attention is once called to it, however, we are compelled to perceive it, and may then look at it both from the desirable and undesirable sides, since both of these sides it has.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>There is certainly no defence or water-proof garment against adverse fortune which is, on the whole, so effectual as an habitual sense of humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>The man who has it can rarely be cast down for a great while by external events; and it is much the same with a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>For some reason or other, in the transplantation to this continent, certain traits were heightened and certain other qualities were diminished among the English-speaking race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Thus much may be safely assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Among the heightened attributes was the sense of humor; and to this, no doubt, some of our seeming virtues may be attributed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>The good-nature of an American crowd, the long-suffering of American travellers under detention or even fraud, the recoil of cheerfulness <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> after the tremendous excitement of a national election&mdash;all these things are partly due to the national habit of looking not so much at the bright side as at the amusing side of all occurrences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>The day after election the most heated partisan, beaten or victorious, not only laughs at the other party, but he laughs at his own; he laughs at himself; and this attitude of mind, which carried <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0267.0016.00130.00572" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> through the vast strain of civil war and emancipation, is an almost essential trait of life in a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>Public men who have this quality are able to thrive on the very wear and tear of political life; public men who are without it, as the late <rs>Charles Sumner</rs>, find the path of duty hard, and are kept up by sheer conscience and will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>And so in private life, the husband and wife who have no mutual enjoyment of this kind, the parents who derive no delight from the droll side of nursery life and the perpetual unconscious humor of childhood, must find daily existence monotonous and wearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>It was from this point of view that <num value="1">one</num> of the cleverest and most useful women I have ever known, the late <persName n="Goddard,Mrs.,Delano,,," id="n0267.0016.00130.00573" reg="default:Goddard,Delano,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Delano</foreName> <surname>Goddard</surname></persName>, of <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, when asked what quality on the whole best promoted <num value="1">one</num>'s usefulness in life, replied, <q direct="unspecified">The sense of humor.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/></p> 
<p>But when this sense of humor is, as <num value="1">one</num> may say, nationalized, it furnishes some occasional disadvantages to set against this merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>It may not only be turned against good causes, but against the whole attitude of earnest study or faithful action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>There is probably no city in the <rs>Union</rs> which publishes books of a higher grade, in proportion to their numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>And yet so fixed is this habit of joking in the mind of our people that it will probably last an indefinite period into the future, and keep all the intellectual impulses of that particular city in the kind of uncomfortable self-consciousness which comes from being always on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>In time such an attitude is outgrown, and people are left to enjoy what they like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>I can remember when the disposition of Bostonians to take pleasure in Beethoven's symphonies was almost as much of a joke to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> editors as is the <q direct="unspecified">humming</q> of culture in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> to-day; but there is fortunately a limit to human endurance in regard to certain particular witticisms, though some of them certainly die hard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The same necessity for a joke invades other quiet enjoyments and harmless occupations, as the study of <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0267.0016.00132.00577" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,William,,,:1"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName> or <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0267.0016.00132.00578" reg="mostcommon:Browning,Robert,,,:3"><surname>Browning</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>On the contrary, such <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0267.0016.00133.00580" reg="mostcommon:Browning,Robert,,,:3"><surname>Browning</surname></persName> clubs as I have happened to look in upon have had the sobriety and reasonableness which are essential to the study of a poet who, although often recondite and difficult, is never vague.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Yet you may go to the meeting of such a club and be struck with the good-sense and moderation of every word that is uttered; no matter; the report in the next day's newspaper &mdash;if reporters are admitted&mdash;will put in all the folly and adulation that the meeting wisely left out, and this because the reporter is expected to exhibit humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>It is worse yet when serious public discussions or the terrible details of police courts are burlesqued in this way. Few things, I should say, are more essentially demoralizing than the facetious police report of the enterprising daily newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The moral of it all is that humor, like fire, is a good servant but a bad master; that it <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> refreshes and relieves the hard work of life, and is meant to do so in the order of nature; but when it becomes an end in itself it takes the real dignity from life, and actually makes its serious work harder. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>during the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> when the writer was a member of a <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State legislature</orgName>, he was often asked if he did not encounter a certain widely spread prejudice against college-bred men. Truth compelled him to reply that he did, but that it almost always proceeded from other college-bred men. Having all his life been in the habit of attending caucuses and political meetings, and having very often presided over them, he has had some opportunity of testing the alleged prejudice of the uneducated against the more educated, in a democratic community, and he can truly say that he never happened to encounter it; but he has very often encountered the attempt to create it among those who should have known better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>In the close contests of politics there is often a temptation to find a weapon against an opponent in the charge of being college-bred or having written a book; but the persons who <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> yield to this temptation are mostly those who have themselves suffered from a similar impeachment, and fancy that they can score a point by turning States' evidence on their own training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>But I have never seen that the effort had more than a very temporary influence in the community at large; and this for obvious reasons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>To begin with, there is very little of this prejudice among the poorer classes in any American community, for these classes are, whether Protestants or <persName n="Catholics,,,,," id="n0267.0020.00162.00750" reg="mostcommon:Catholics,nomatch:0"><surname>Catholics</surname></persName>, not yet very remote from the time when they reverenced their clergy, and when this body represented leadership in all the walks of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Among the <name>Puritans</name>, as is well known, the colleges existed to train clergymen, and the clergy existed to fill all the posts of leadership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>There was no separate legal profession, for instance; and <persName n="Sewall,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0267.0020.00162.00751" reg="mostcommon:Sewall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Sewall</surname></persName>&mdash;whose racy journals make him the more sombre <persName n="Pepys,,,,," id="n0267.0020.00162.00752" reg="mostcommon:Pepys,Samuel,,,:1"><surname>Pepys</surname></persName> of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Colonial period&mdash;was educated for the ministry and took a seat on the bench by way of collateral pursuit, precisely as he accepted the command of the <name>Ancient</name> and Honorable <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> <orgName type="mil" key="ArtilleryCompany">Artillery Company</orgName> and paraded with it on the <rs>Boston Common</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/><persName n="Goodale,Professor,,,," id="n0267.0020.00163.00753" reg="mostcommon:Goodale,G.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Goodale</surname></persName>, the <rs>Harvard</rs> botanist, has lately shown that the beginnings of natural science in the curriculum of that institution were due to the fact, that being organized for the rearing of <name>Christian</name> ministers it must give them some knowledge of anatomy and the <hi rend="italics">Materia Medica</hi>, in order that they might prescribe for their sick parishioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Even business matters were to some extent within their grasp, and this lasted into this century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>An eminent lawyer, distinguished for his skill in the charge of great trust properties, having lately died in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, I was calling attention to the fact that when I knew him, in college, he never gave the slightest sign of peculiar business aptitude; but I was at once told by <num value="1">one</num> who had known his father, a country clergyman, that this good pastor was the business adviser of his whole parish, and did for rural traders what his son afterward did for great capitalists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>Thus much for the <name>Protestant</name> side; and among our Catholic citizens it is so the custom to see the clergy intrusted with great financial responsibilities, that no <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> sneer against educated men ever comes from them; they err on the other side, in too great willingness to intrust their savings to their spiritual advisers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>The supposed prejudice against the incapacity of men of scholarly pursuits does not, therefore, come from the poorer class, whether Catholic or Protestant, nor does it come from the great intermediate and powerful class of the <rs>Silas Laphams</rs>; on the contrary, the college-bred man is more often touched by a certain covert and needless humility on the part of this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>The organizers of labor, the heads of great enterprises, are often mute and timid before those very much their inferiors in real training, simply from their consciousness that they are weak in things which are really of secondary importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Just as an Englishman who has once discovered that he misplaces his H's will sometimes hold his tongue when he has things to say more important than all the separate letters of the alphabet put together; so is it often with the uneducated <rs>American</rs> who seems to exult in all the glory of material success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>In the <orgName n="Massachusetts Legislature" type="legislature">Massachusetts Legislature</orgName> I <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> have had men come and beg me to make their speeches for them in regard to a certain measure, they putting all the facts and material into my hands, although they knew <num value="10">ten</num> times as much about it as I, and could, consequently, make a far more effective speech; and this simply because they knew that their verbs did not always agree with their nominative cases, and they attached an exaggerated importance to this minor matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Whatever may be the defects of the much-discussed American temperament, obtuseness is certainly not <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>The unschooled <rs>American</rs> recognizes and laments his ignorance, and, indeed, commonly exaggerates it; that is, he does not reflect that he perhaps knows things which are vastly more important than the things which he does not know, and which his college-bred neighbor knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>That is why he sends his son to college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>A friend of mine, a merchant by training and a most acute observer, had a theory that the college graduates did not care so very much to send their sons where they had been, as knowing that it had not done very much for themselves; but that the nonuates <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> were very anxious to send theirs, because they attributed their own shortcomings to the want of that early advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>Thus, he reasoned, every alternate generation goes to the university.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>In the same way, I think that the college-bred man, or at any rate the man of literary pursuits, is apt to be more humble for himself than he is wished by others to be. It is like that curious self-humiliation, at the beginning of our Civil War, of those who had not been trained in the militia, in presence of those who had received such training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>A book of tactics looked, when <num value="1">one</num> opened it, harder than <persName><foreName>Euclid</foreName></persName>'s Geometry; and it took a little time to discover that it was, for a man with tolerably clear head, as simple as the spelling-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>So the student is apt to think that the elementary principles of business, or the rules of parliamentary law, are things requiring long and difficult training; whereas they do not, in acquiring, prove very hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Then it must be remembered that, in this country at least, the scholar has very commonly made his own way in the world and has had to develop the practical <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> faculty, in a small way, from the very beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>Nothing is more interesting, in a university town, than to see the variety of antecedents, usually involving some knowledge of men, with which the older students have come together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>In a nation where small mechanics and country shopkeepers become millionnaires and presidents, it is not strange that the student whose early life was perhaps not very different from theirs should also have his practical side.</p>
