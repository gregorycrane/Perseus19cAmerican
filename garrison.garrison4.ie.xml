<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>But it is evident that his moral nature is quite subordinate to his intellect, so as to taint his philosophy of action, and prevent him from rising to a higher level than that of an expedientist and compromiser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The key to his public life is contained in this very speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Here it is: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/></p> 
<p>If, in the expression of these views, I have not proposed what is desired or expected by many others, they will do me the justice to believe <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> that I am as far from having suggested what, in many respects, would have been in harmony with cherished convictions of my own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Those with whom we must necessarily act, entertaining different views, have the power and right of carrying them into practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>We must be content to lead when we can, and to follow when we cannot lead; and if we cannot at any time do for our country all the good that we would wish, we must be satisfied with doing for her all the good that we can.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/></p> 
<p>Now, a declaration like this, expressed in such carefully considered language, carries upon its face nothing startling or objectionable; because it is the merest truism to say, that where there are many minds of conflicting views to be reconciled, mutual concessions must be made to secure the desired unity of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>And where no moral principle, no sacrifice of justice, is involved, a course like this is the dictate of common sense; otherwise, the state of society would be chaotic, and an efficient administration of public concerns impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>But in the sentence, <quote> In political affairs we cannot always do what seems to be absolutely best,</quote> there is to be found the germ of all political profligacy, and the nest-egg of all those sinful compromises which have cursed this nation since the adoption of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>There is no position in which men may place themselves, or be placed by others, where they can be justified, whether to reach <quote>a consummation devoutly to be wished,</quote> or to avoid formidable danger or great suffering, in violating their consciences, or conniving at what their moral sense condemns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Personal integrity and straightforward regard for the right can allow no temptation to make them swerve a hair's-breadth from the line of duty; for they are of more consequence than all the compacts and constitutions ever made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Disregardful of this, the doctrine that <quote> the end sanctifies the means,</quote> or that <quote> we cannot always do what seems to be absolutely best,</quote> becomes the doctrine of devils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>I commend your anxiety in regard to the course to be pursued both by the <hi rend="italics">Standard</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, respecting the present <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> critical state of affairs; and fully agree with you, that there has never been a time when abolitionists should weigh their words (whether written or spoken) more carefully than now, in order to avoid needless persecution and baffle pro-slavery malignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Our work, as abolitionists, is still to impeach, censure, and condemn where we must, and approve when we can; but, in such an inflammable state of the country, the injunction: <q direct="unspecified">Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless as doves,</q> deserves to be carefully heeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>I have always believed that the anti-slavery cause has had aroused against it a great deal of uncalled-for hostility, in consequence of extravagance of speech, and want of tact and good judgment, on the part of some most desirous to promote its advancement; but this is a drawback which has ever affected the success of reformatory movements, and grows out of the incompleteness of human development.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>It is very desirable, as you intimate, that the <hi rend="italics">Standard</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> should harmonize, as far as practicable, in the mode of dealing with such correspondents as wish to make use of their columns to express their honest but often badly expressed sentiments on men and things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>In common, on the ground of free discussion, we are both often called to publish what, on the score of good taste and fair criticism, we cannot endorse; but I grant a larger indulgence than it would be proper for you to do, seeing that no <num value="1">one</num> else is responsible for the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> but myself; whereas, the <hi rend="italics">Standard</hi> is the official organ of the <orgName n="American Anti Slavery Society" type="society">American Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>, and on that account should be conducted with more habitual circumspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Still, I would have the <hi rend="italics">Standard</hi> err on the side of liberality, rather than of exclusiveness, so as to always indicate its fearlessness of the most thorough investigation and the strongest dissent; while, at the same time, I would have you exercise your own good judgment, just as you have hitherto done, in determining what shall appear in the <hi rend="italics">Standard</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>As it now stands, it reads thus:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>I believe that there is only <num value="1">one</num> party at the <rs>North</rs> that is ready to make such a sacrifice for such an object, and that is the party of Copperheads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>I would therefore propose that the resolution be amended as follows:</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/></p> 
<p>This, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, is what I am willing to admit, and what I believe; but I would always rather err on the side of charitable judgment than of excessive condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>The resolution, as offered, is an impeachment of motives, not of ability or vigilance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>It commits us to the assertion, that we believe the <rs>Government</rs>&mdash;meaning <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0205.0004.00095.00884" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in particular&mdash;is ready to do a most infamous act, namely, <quote>to sacrifice the interest and honor of the <rs>North</rs> to secure a sham peace,</quote> whereby the <rs>President</rs>'s <persName n="Proclamation,,Emancipation,,," id="n0205.0004.00095.00885" reg="default:Proclamation,Emancipation,,,"><foreName>Emancipation</foreName> <surname>Proclamation</surname></persName> shall be rendered null and void, and the slave oligarchy restored to their original supremacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>Now, sir, I do not believe a word of it, and therefore I cannot vote for it. To be ready to do a base thing for a base end implies both will and purpose; it means something more than liability: it amounts to perfidy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>There was a time when I had little confidence in <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0205.0004.00095.00886" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and very little respect for him: it was when, for almost <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> after secession had taken place, he was evidently averse to seeing that slavery had any vital connection with the rebellion, and so refused to strike a blow at its existence. . . . But the time <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> came at last when the <rs>President</rs>, unless he was determined to be wilfully and wickedly blind, was compelled to see that slavery and the rebellion were indissolubly bound up together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>Then came the proclamation of unconditional and everlasting emancipation to <num value="3000000">three million</num> <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> slaves, leaving not <num value="1">one</num> to clank his fetters in any rebel State; and then, all that is vile and seditious in the <name>Copperhead</name>, pro-slavery, rebelsympathizing element in the <rs>North</rs> burst forth against him, and to this hour continues to pour every vial of its wrath upon his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>Since that event, and in view of what has followed in the enrolment of tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of colored soldiers, I have changed my opinion of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0205.0004.00096.00887" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>Whether I shall again be connected with the press, in a similar capacity, is quite problematical; but, at my period of life, I feel no prompting to start a new journal at my own risk, and with the certainty of struggling against wind and tide, as I have done in the past.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>I began the publication of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> without a subscriber, and I end it&mdash;it gives me unalloyed satisfaction to say&mdash; without a farthing as the pecuniary result of the patronage extended to it during <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> of unremitted labors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>From the immense change wrought in the national feeling and sentiment on the subject of slavery, the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> derived <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> no advantage at any time in regard to its circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>The original <q direct="unspecified">disturber of the peace,</q> nothing was left undone at the beginning, and up to the hour of the late rebellion, by Southern slaveholding villany on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and Northern pro-slavery malice on the other, to represent it as too vile a sheet to be countenanced by any claiming to be Christian or patriotic; and it always required rare moral courage or singular personal independence to be among its patrons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>Never had a journal to look such opposition in the face&mdash;never was <num value="1">one</num> so constantly belied and caricatured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>If it had advocated all the crimes forbidden by the moral law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the statutes of the <rs>State</rs>, instead of vindicating the sacred claims of oppressed and bleeding humanity, it could not have been more vehemently denounced or more indignantly repudiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>To this day&mdash;such is the force of prejudice&mdash;there are multitudes who cannot be induced to read a single number of it, even on the score of curiosity, though their views on the slavery question are now precisely those which it has uniformly advocated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>Yet no journal has been conducted with such fairness and impartiality; none has granted such freedom in its columns to its opponents; none has so scrupulously and uniformly presented all sides of every question discussed in its pages; none has so readily and exhaustively published, without note or comment, what its enemies have said to its disparagement and the vilification of its editor; none has vindicated primitive Christianity, in its spirit and purpose&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">the higher law,</q> in its supremacy over nations and governments as well as individual conscience&mdash;the <rs>Golden Rule</rs>, in its binding obligation upon all classes&mdash;the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, with its self-evident truths&mdash;the rights of human nature, without distinction of race, complexion, or sex&mdash;more earnestly or more uncompromisingly; none has exerted a higher moral or more broadly reformatory influence upon those who have given it a careful perusal; and none has gone beyond it in asserting the <name>Fatherhood</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the brotherhood of man. All this may be claimed for it without egotism or presumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>It has ever been <q direct="unspecified">a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>It has excited the fierce hostility of all that is vile and demoniacal in the land, and won the affection and regard of the purest and noblest of the age. To me it has been unspeakably cheering, and the richest compensation for whatever of peril, suffering, and defamation I have been called to encounter, that <num value="1">one</num> uniform testimony has been borne, by those who have had its weekly perusal, as to the elevating and quickening <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> influence of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> upon their character and lives; and the deep grief they are expressing in view of its discontinuance is overwhelmingly affecting to my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>Many of these date their subscriptions from the commencement of the paper, and they have allowed nothing in its columns to pass without a rigid scrutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>They speak, therefore, experimentally, and <q direct="unspecified">testify of that which they have seen and do know.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>Let them be assured that my regret in the separation which is to take place between us, in consequence of the discontinuance of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, is at least as poignant as their own; and let them feel, as I do, comforted by the thought that it relates only to the weekly method of communicating with each other, and not to the principles we have espoused in the past, or the hopes and aims we cherish as to the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>Although the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> was designed to be, and has ever been, mainly devoted to the abolition of slavery, yet it has been instrumental in aiding the cause of reform in many of its most important aspects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>I have never consulted either the subscription-list of the paper or public sentiment in printing, or omitting to print, any article touching any matter whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>Personally, I have never asked any <num value="1">one</num> to become a subscriber, nor any <num value="1">one</num> to contribute to its support, nor presented its claims for a better circulation in any lecture or speech, or at any <num value="1">one</num> of the multitudinous anti-slavery gatherings in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>Had I done so, no doubt its subscription-list might have been much enlarged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>In this connection, I must be permitted to express my surprise that I am gravely informed, in various quarters, that this is no time to retire from public labor; that though the chains of the captive have been broken, he is yet to be vindicated in regard to the full possession of equal civil and political rights; that the freedmen in every part of the <rs>South</rs> are subjected to many insults and outrages; that the old slaveholding spirit is showing itself in every available form; that there is imminent danger that, in the hurry of reconstruction and readmission to the <rs>Union</rs>, the late rebel States will be left free to work any amount of mischief; that there is manifestly a severe struggle yet to come with the <rs>Southern</rs> <q direct="unspecified">powers of darkness,</q> which will require the utmost vigilance and the most determined efforts on the part of the friends of impartial liberty&mdash;etc., etc., etc. Surely, it is not meant by all this that I am therefore bound to continue the publication of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>; for that is a matter for me to determine, and no <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>As I commenced its publication <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> without asking leave of any <num value="1">one</num>, so I claim to be competent to decide when it may fitly close its career.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>Again&mdash;it cannot be meant, by this presentation of the existing state of things at the <rs>South</rs>, either to impeach my intelligence, or to impute to me a lack of interest in behalf of that race for the liberation and elevation of which I have labored so many years!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>If, when they had no friends, and no hope of earthly redemption, I did not hesitate to make their cause my own, is it to be supposed that, with their yokes broken, and their friends and advocates multiplied indefinitely, I can be any the less disposed to stand by them to the last&mdash;to insist on the full measure of justice and equity being meted out to them&mdash;to retain in my breast a lively and permanent interest in all that relates to their present condition and future welfare?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>I shall sound no trumpet and make no parade as to what I shall do for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>After having gone through with such a struggle as has never been paralleled in duration in the life of any reformer, and for nearly <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> been the target at which all poisonous and deadly missiles have been hurled, and having seen our great national iniquity blotted out, and freedom <q direct="unspecified">proclaimed throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof,</q> and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> presses and pulpits supporting the claims of the colored population to fair treatment where not <num value="1">one</num> could be found to do this in the early days of the antislavery conflict, I might&mdash;it seems to me&mdash;be permitted to take a little repose in my advanced years, if I desired to do so. But, as yet, I have neither asked nor wished to be relieved of any burdens or labors connected with the good old cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>I see a mighty work of enlightenment and regeneration yet to be accomplished at the <rs>South</rs>, and many cruel wrongs done to the freedmen which are yet to be redressed; and I neither counsel others to turn away from the field of conflict, under the delusion that no more remains to be done, nor contemplate such a course in my own case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>The object for which the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> was commenced&mdash;the extermination of chattel slavery&mdash;having been gloriously consummated, it seems to me specially appropriate to let its existence cover the historic period of the great struggle; leaving what remains to be done to complete the work of emancipation to other instrumentalities (of which I hope to avail myself), under new auspices, with more abundant means, and with <num value="1000000">millions</num> instead of hundreds for allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>After the lapse of <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> of the most exacting labor, of controversy, peril, and misconception, he has been permitted to see the object gained to which he, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> almost alone, consecrated his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>The generation which immediately preceded ours regarded him only as a wild enthusiast, a fanatic, or a public enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>The present generation sees in him the bold and honest reformer, the man of original, self-poised, heroic will, inspired by a vision of universal justice made actual in the practice of nations; who, daring to attack without reserve the worst and <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> most powerful oppression of his country and his time, has outlived the <rs>Giant Wrong</rs> he assailed, and has triumphed over the sophistries by which it was maintained.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/>In this difficult and perilous work, his labors have been so exclusively directed to the single aim of the overthrow of American Slavery, and so absorbing and severe, that, with abilities capable of winning fortune as well as reputation, he is now, in respect to worldly honors and emoluments, as he was at the commencement of his career.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>We ask simply to arrest the attention of the <rs>American</rs> people to the obligations they owe to this American.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>He was the advocate of no private interest, he was the representative of no sect or party; with no hope of worldly profit to be reaped from the measures and the principles he urged, he was the conspicuous, the acknowledged, the prophetic leader of the movement in behalf of the <rs>American Slave</rs>&mdash;now consummated by the <name>Edict</name> of Universal Emancipation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>It cannot mar the dignity of his position as a man of honest intellectual and moral independence, to receive a substantial testimonial of the good &mdash; will and grateful respect of his friends and countrymen; nor can it be more than an honorable recognition on the part of the uncounted multitudes, of all parties and sections, who must confess themselves to have become his debtors, to give to him such a testimonial, and to make it substantial.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>We have received in all, after deducting every necessary expense, <measure n="31000dollars" type="currency">thirty-one thousand dollars</measure>, which we are happy now <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> to place in your hands; and this sum we have reason to believe will be increased <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2000dollars" type="currency">two thousand dollars</measure> more from sources where we know a subscription has been undertaken, but is not yet finished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>The testimonial is in every sense national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>Contributions to it have come from every quarter of the country, from all classes, the rich and the poor, the educated and the unlearned, from persons of both sexes, of every religious and political opinion, and of every race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>The sums we have received have been given always cheerfully, often joyfully, the donors declaring it a privilege and an honor to share in the offering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>Distinguished philanthropists of other countries have also, unsolicited, added their offerings to this testimonial fund.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>It gives us the highest gratification to present this national tribute to you as the leader and inspirer of the movement against American slavery, which has resulted in <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest moral triumphs the world has ever witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>Having devoted yourself from early manhood wholly to the cause of human freedom, regardless of all personal dangers and sacrifices, you have now the joy of living in a country of which all the inhabitants are free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>Whatever trials and sufferings may await the race for which you have labored, they can never again be reduced to slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>Our pleasure on this occasion is saddened only by the recollection that our chairman, the late <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0205.0007.00184.01858" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>, who entered into the plan of the committee with all the energy of his sympathetic nature, using both his tongue and pen to promote it, cannot place his name with ours here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>No <num value="1">one</num> would have rejoiced more than he in the accomplishment of this effort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>We trust, <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0205.0007.00184.01859" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, the offering we present will cheer you and <persName n="Garrison,Mrs.,,,," id="n0205.0007.00184.01860" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> during the remainder of your lives, be they longer or shorter, not merely by the material resources which it brings, but by the precious recollection that it is the gift of a grateful generation of your countrymen and friends.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>respected friends: In replying to your very kind letter of the <dateStruct value="--10"><day reg="10">10th instant</day></dateStruct>, transferring to my hands the truly generous sum obtained by you as a national testimonial, in recognition of my labors in the anti-slavery cause through a long and perilous struggle, I shall try in vain to find words adequately to express my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>I can only tender to you my heartfelt thanks for this signal proof of your personal esteem and good-will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>I am so constituted as not to fear the frowns of men, when conscious of being in the right; yet no <num value="1">one</num> should desire more strongly than I have always done to secure the regards of the wise, the good, and the true, next to the approval of my own conscience as unto <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>All controversy, where no principle is involved, no right to be vindicated, no wrong to be redressed, is utterly distasteful to my temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>If, therefore, for a long series of years, I was <q direct="unspecified">a disturber of the peace</q> and <q direct="unspecified">a troubler of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>,</q> it was not of my choice or seeking; but necessity was laid upon me so to act, by the heinous wrongfulness of chattel slavery, by the <rs>Christian</rs> obligation to remember those in bonds as bound with them, by the irresistible claims of outraged human nature, and by a more than patriotic interest in the welfare of my native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2577"/>Little indeed did I know or anticipate how prolonged or how virulent would be the struggle, when I lifted up the standard of immediate emancipation, and essayed to rouse the nation to a sense of its guilt and danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/>But, having put my hand to the plow, how could I look back?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2579"/>For, in a cause so righteous, I could not doubt that, having turned the furrows, if I sowed in tears I should <num value="1">one</num> day reap in joy. But, whether permitted to live to witness the abolition of slavery or not, I felt assured that, as I demanded nothing that was not clearly in accordance with justice and humanity, some time or other, if remembered at all, I should stand vindicated in the eyes of my countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>The charge is not true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>On this question my influence, humble as it is, is felt at this moment to a considerable extent, and shall be felt in coming years, not perniciously but beneficially&mdash;not as a curse but as a blessing; and posterity will bear testimony that I was right.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>Happily, I have not had to wait for posterity for my vindication&mdash;a generous and complete vindication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>But, by the <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> mighty power of a wonder-working <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, I have been permitted to see the gory system of slavery annihilated, and its <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of captives set free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>My reproach has been turned into commendation, and my shame into honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>In approval of this testimonial, I see the honored name of <persName n="Chase,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0205.0007.00186.01870" reg="nearbymention:Chase,S.,P.,,"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>Some of these I have never seen, and probably shall never see in the flesh; but I wish to thank each <num value="1">one</num> of them as in his immediate presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>Among the contributors abroad are the honored names of John Bright, <placeName reg="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</placeName>, <persName n="Forster,,William,E.,," id="n0205.0007.00186.01872" reg="default:Forster,William,E.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName>, <persName n="Potter,,Thomas,B.,," id="n0205.0007.00186.01873" reg="expanded:Potter,Thomas,Bayley,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Potter</surname></persName>, <persName n="Morley,,Samuel,,," id="n0205.0007.00186.01874" reg="default:Morley,Samuel,,,"><foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Morley</surname></persName>, <persName n="Cropper,,John,,," id="n0205.0007.00186.01875" reg="default:Cropper,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Cropper</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Albright,,Arthur,,," id="n0205.0007.00186.01876" reg="default:Albright,Arthur,,,"><foreName>Arthur</foreName> <surname>Albright</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>The moral verdict rendered by such an array is prized by me incomparably above all the <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> ever coined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>While it has particular reference to my career, for the reasons set forth in the appeal, it also means much more than this&mdash;namely, the vindication of the anti-slavery movement as such, and of all who have faithfully labored to secure its triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>Its design, therefore, is neither pecuniary reward nor personal exaltation; but is vitalized and made all-embracing by the sublime historical event to which it relates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>Having never sought the applause of my fellow-men, nor asked any favors at their hands, nor claimed to be more than others in labors and sacrifices in the cause of the oppressed, I trust no <num value="1">one</num> will be found so unjust as to impute to me a wish to have any of my co-laborers thrown into the shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/>Long before I took up the advocacy of the rights of man, without regard to race or complexion, many had done the same, in their way and according to the light given them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2596"/>Liberty has never been without her witnesses on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2597"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> contains, in its <q direct="unspecified">self-evident truths,</q> all the abolitionism I have ever enunciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>So does the <rs>Golden Rule</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2599"/>Certainly I have never sought to put myself up, nor any fellowworker <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2600"/>As to where I have stood and what I have done, by the help of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, for the extinction of slavery in this land, the fury of the oppressor in the past is a more sure certificate than any that can now be given me by the friends of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2601"/>Yet, without co-workers from the greatest to the least, and in every position in society, my labors had been almost in vain, and peradventure the year of jubilee indefinitely postponed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>Of this testimonial I may be permitted to say, that none was ever more unsought or more unexpected; none more spontaneous or more honorable was ever proffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>Under the guise of self-abnegation, I might decline it; but I have labored in vain if I have now to prove my disinterestedness by refusing to accept this mark <q direct="unspecified">of the good &mdash; will and grateful respect of friends and countrymen.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>He who insists upon always giving, but never receiving, may possibly discover that he is actuated by a false pride and a selfish exclusiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>Perceiving the spirit and object which have prompted this testimonial, and the complete justification of a once hated but now gloriously triumphant cause embodied in it, I accept it in no dependent sense, nor as a pecuniary reward for any sacrifices made or labors performed, but with becoming self-respect, and with untrammelled freedom of thought, speech, and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>I accept it, moreover, not as relating to any other question than that of slavery, not as an approval of all my methods of action or modes of expression (for some of these I should be quite sure to alter on a critical revision, now that the heat and smoke of the conflict are ended), but exactly for what it is intended to sanction and commend, to wit&mdash;the cause of universal freedom, and an unswerving advocacy of that cause, at whatever cost or peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>By the abolition of slavery, notwithstanding the pangs and dangers of our present transitional state, we may ultimately hope for all crowning mercies upon our beloved country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>For brass there shall be brought forth gold, and for iron silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>Every man shall sit under his own vine, and there shall be none to molest or make afraid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>My pleasure, gentlemen of the committee, is saddened in this connection, as well as your own, in view of the sudden demise of your lamented chairman, <persName n="Andrew,ex-Governor,,,," id="n0205.0007.00187.01877" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,A.,,"><roleName n="ex-Governor">ex-Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>, who honored me with his friendship and confidence when friends and supporters were <q direct="unspecified">few and far between,</q> and who took a more than friendly interest in the inception and completion of this testimonial, himself writing the appeal to the people, and exerting his influence to get it responded to, to the full extent therein <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> designated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>Were he now living, no <num value="1">one</num> would take more pleasure in the result than himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>His loss is a national bereavement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>For, since the tragical death of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0205.0007.00188.01878" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:18"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, what public man has been so widely lamented as himself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>So gentle, yet so forcible!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>so conciliating, yet so outspoken!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>so modest, yet so intrepid!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>so yielding where no sense of duty was involved, yet so inflexible in the maintenance of his principles!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>so full of <q direct="unspecified">the milk of human kindness,</q> yet so like a flame of fire against injustice!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>so thoroughly domestic in his affections and habits, yet so ready at all times to be sacrificed in the service of his country!&mdash;among the most manly of men, the most upright of statesmen, and the best of patriots!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>What he did as <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, during the late slave-holding rebellion, both for the <rs>State</rs> which he represented and the nation whose liberties he upheld, is it not a signal part of the history of the times, to be admiringly rehearsed by a grateful posterity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>In him the hunted fugitive slave always found an advocate ready to interpose all his legal ability and forensic eloquence to shield him from the terrible fate of rendition; for the <num value="1000000">millions</num> in bondage he cherished the deepest sympathy; and the entire colored population of the republic should ever cherish his memory with grateful emotions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>In looking back, no doubt, to the contest which was maintained in this country some <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> ago against slavery in our colonies, we may recollect that <persName n="Clarkson,,,,," id="n0205.0008.00205.02080" reg="mostcommon:Clarkson,nomatch:0"><surname>Clarkson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wilberforce,,,,," id="n0205.0008.00205.02081" reg="mostcommon:Wilberforce,Henry,,,:1"><surname>Wilberforce</surname></persName> were denounced as fanatics, and had to encounter much opprobrium; but it must not be forgotten that, so far as regards the entwining of the roots of slavery into the social system, in the opinions and interests of mankind, there was no comparison whatever between the circumstances of that contest here and those which attended it in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>(Hear, hear.) The number of persons who, in this country, were enlisted on the side of slavery by personal interest was always comparatively few; whilst, in attacking slavery at its headquarters in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0205.0008.00205.02082" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> had to encounter the fiercest passions which could be roused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>(Hear, hear.) That is, indeed, a tremendous sea which runs upon the surface of the human mind when the storms of passion and of self-interest run counter to the secret currents of conscience and the sense of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>(Cheers.)</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>(Hear, hear.) It is true, indeed, that we have lately seen some of the most tremendous and bloody wars which history records; and I, for <num value="1">one</num>, must admit that the time has not yet come&mdash;it is not even yet in sight&mdash;when we can beat our swords into ploughshares and our spears into pruning-hooks; but if we look to the great events to which I have referred, we shall see that in our own time the march of great battalions has generally been in the wake of the march of great principles&mdash;(hear, hear)&mdash;that in the freedom of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, in the consolidation of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and still more in the recent contest in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, we are to look to the triumphs of opinion as, in the main, the triumphs which have been won. (Cheers.) I can understand the joy which must be felt by a great sovereign, or by a great general, when, standing amidst the heaps of slain, he can feel that he has won the independence of a country, or, still better, has established the independence of a race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>We can all, however, understand still better the joy of him who, like our distinguished friend, after years of obloquy and oppression, and being denounced as the fanatical supporter of extreme opinions, finds himself acknowledged at last by his <pb id="p.206" n="206"/> countrymen and the world as the prophet and apostle of a triumphant and accepted cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>A noble work nobly done always contains in itself, not <num value="1">one</num>, but many lessons; and in the case of him whose character and deeds we are here to commemorate, <num value="2">two</num> may be singled out specially deserving to be laid to heart by all who would wish to leave the world better than they found it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson is,&mdash;Aim at something great; aim at things which are difficult; and there is no great thing which is not difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>Do not pare down your undertaking to what you can hope to see successful in the next few years, or in the years of your own life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>Fear not the reproach of Quixotism or of fanaticism; but after you have well weighed what you undertake, if you see your way clearly, and are convinced that you <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> are right, go forward, even though you, like <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0205.0008.00212.02110" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, do it at the risk of being torn to pieces by the very men through whose changed hearts your purpose will <num value="1">one</num> day be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Fight on with all your strength against whatever odds, and with however small a band of supporters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>If you are right, the time will come when that small band will swell into a multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>You will at least lay the foundations of something memorable, and you may, like <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0205.0008.00212.02111" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>,&mdash;though you ought not to need or expect so great a reward,&mdash;be spared to see that work completed which, when you began it, you only hoped it might be given to you to help forward a few stages on its way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/></p> 
<p>The other lesson which it appears to me important to enforce, amongst the many that may be drawn from our friend's life, is this: If you aim at something noble and succeed in it, you will generally find that you have succeeded not in that alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>A <num value="100">hundred</num> other good and noble things which you never dreamed of will have been accomplished by the way, and the more certainly, the sharper and more agonizing has been the struggle which preceded the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>The heart and mind of a nation are never stirred from their foundations without manifold good fruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>In the case of the great American contest, these fruits have been already great, and are daily becoming greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>The prejudices which beset every form of society&mdash;and of which there was a plentiful crop in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>&mdash;are rapidly melting away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>The chains of prescription have been broken; it is not only the slave who has been freed&mdash;the mind of America has been emancipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>The whole intellect of the country has been set thinking about the fundamental questions of society and government; and the new problems which have to be solved, and the new difficulties which have to be encountered, are calling forth new activity of thought, and that great nation is saved, probably for a long time to come, from the most formidable danger of a completely settled state of society and opinion&mdash;intellectual and moral stagnation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/></p> 
<p>This, then, is an additional item of the debt which <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> and mankind owe to <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0205.0008.00212.02112" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> and his noble associates; and it is well calculated to deepen our sense of the truth which his whole career most strikingly illustrates&mdash;that though our bestdirected efforts may often seem wasted and lost, nothing coming of them that can be pointed to and distinctly identified as a definite gain to humanity; though this may happen <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> times in every <num value="100">hundred</num>, the <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> time the result may be <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> so great and dazzling that we had never dared to hope for it, and should have regarded him who had predicted it to us as sanguine beyond the bounds of mental sanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>Ms.</note> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>My dear friend:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>Your letter has moved me deeply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>I could write sheets full; but, if I write at all, it must be very briefly, and I do wish to write with my own hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>After the months and years that my mind has been full of you, and my sympathy has been all awake and alive, as you were passing through the experience of success, after such a struggle, it seems strange to send you such a note as this must be. But I am <hi rend="italics">not</hi> better, and I must be content to do only what I can.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>It seems to my companion (my dear niece <persName><foreName>Jane</foreName></persName>) and myself that I ought to tell you the case about your coming (as it regards us) precisely as it appears to us. You must then judge for yourself what to do. I need not say that no amount of <pb id="p.226" n="226"/> fatigue or other suffering would deter me for a moment from attempting to see you. It is not <hi rend="italics">that</hi> which is in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>But my disease is enlargement of the heart, and my life is precarious to the last degree; and strong emotion of any kind is dangerous accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>I could not see <hi rend="italics">you</hi> without strong emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>It is not a question of self-command, but the heart stops when I am feeble, or startled, or in any way moved, and it is always very doubtful whether it will go on again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>For this reason, and because of my being soon exhausted, and also, at times, because I can hear scarcely at all, I have not, for a long time past, seen any person whatever but the family and my most intimate neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>Sometimes, however, I am, for the hour together, able to talk and to listen, and to enjoy seeing a friend's face.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>Now, here you have the facts; and I must leave the decision to yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>I would see you, if possible, and should be grateful and happy to do so; but I might be unable, and I dare not ask you to come so far for such a chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>If you do come, you had better not let me know the time, perhaps, that there may be no exhaustion from expectation before we meet. . . . Our valley is in full beauty at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>My dear friend: I really cannot resist telling you how happy you have made me by the present of your likeness and that of your dear wife, <pb id="p.227" n="227"/> and by the hearty affection of your letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3135"/>It would do me more harm to be silent towards you than it possibly can to write these few lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>Few strangers would recognize the face before me as the same that hangs over my study chimney-piece,&mdash;the portrait I brought with me from <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>; but I see the identity, and am rejoiced to know your later aspect,&mdash;the face that looked in upon me at <placeName key="tgn,7010024" n="1.000 1" reg="tynemouth,north tyneside,england,united kingdom,europe">Tynemouth</placeName> being between the <num value="2">two</num>.<note anchored="yes" type="margin">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>We must take it as <num value="1">one</num> of the trials of the illness, to be accepted cheerfully.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>If you should come this way, after all, it would be a true kindness in you to call at Fox How, where the <name>Arnolds</name> will be at home for some time to come.

The boy was too young to enter into the story, but the deep emotion of his father's voice thrilled him, and that has been the association with your name in his mind ever since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>Then, again, you know <persName n="Forster,,W.,E.,," id="n0205.0008.00227.02221" reg="expanded:Forster,William,E.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Forster</surname></persName> is the husband of <persName n="Arnold,Doctor,,,," id="n0205.0008.00227.02222" reg="nearbymention:Arnold,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName>'s eldest daughter; and you can be in no doubt how he feels towards you. I do hope you are seeing him in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, in spite of his anxious business in Parliament. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>My dear friend, there is <num value="1">one</num> word more that I must say. I value unspeakably your sympathy, and your sense of my sympathy, in the great interest which has occupied so much of our lives; but it leads you to overrate very much any sacrifices I have made or risked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>I will not pretend to deny that what I have done has been of some use; but what I have suffered is so little that I am ashamed to hear of it from a confessor like you.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>It was only repute and comfort for <num value="1">one</num> single year in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that I risked, and so much evil-speaking since as angry people chose to utter,&mdash;quite harmlessly to me, as long as the sea rolled between them and me. You, of all men, least need to be told how harmless the slanders and scoldings of strangers are; and I don't know that they have done me any harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>I certainly never cared for them, at home or abroad. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>I do not suffer very much, as long as we can preserve perfect quiet; and we have no cares or troubles in this house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>All about me is love and peace.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>I am much obliged to you for your appreciation of my services and sacrifices in the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>I hope the services may have been somewhere near your valuation of them; but I claim no credit for the sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>For, really, I made none that were not a <num value="100">hundred</num>-fold compensated for by the satisfaction attending my course and the friendships I obtained by it&mdash;chief among which was that with yourself.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>At the time I came into the cause, and all the time I was engaged in it, it never seemed to me that there was anything else for a man who wished to take some part in public affairs to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>Anti-Slavery was the only national and historical movement on foot&mdash;besides its humanitarian aspects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>As for the <hi rend="italics">cold shoulders</hi> and petty social ostracisms, I really cared nothing about them&mdash;and there was not much of it that was forced upon my notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>I knew I was abused behind my back, but people were always civil enough to my face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>And I never made the slightest show of having done anything I was ashamed of. Quite the contrary.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/>His own manuscript was flawless, punctilious to the last degree, and as legible as the print itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>He seldom, except on grave occasions, resorted to a rough draft, but wrote almost without correction, his afterthought coming so quickly <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> that his finger could generally blot out the faulty word while the ink was still wet. He had a habit of gently tapping the paper with his pen-hand while deliberating for a phrase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4268"/>The psychical and moral side of this was an extreme scrupulousness, that weighed every word and uttered nothing at random.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>It is seldom that anything like abandon is found in his private correspondence, despite the haste in which he commonly wrote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>In his letters, as in his speeches, he had always <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in mind justness and aptness of expression, not the pleasure of the reader or listener, least of all the effect (how will it sound?), as gratifying his own vanity or sense of rhetorical power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>He thus lacked both the ease and versatility and the perfect sympathy which are combined in the great letterwriters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4272"/>His tact, however, was remarkable, and his letters were highly prized by the recipients, especially when of a consolatory nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4275"/>His domestic correspondence did not escape the general stiffness of his epistolary manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>A man so much in the glare of public censure could not shake off the consciousness of the scrutiny to which his most trivial and private utterances might be subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4277"/>Even when addressing his wife, especially if he was absent on a lecturing tour, he either wrote so that extracts might be made for the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> as a <hi rend="italics">quasi-report</hi>, or in view of the necessity of the letter being shown to the abolition circle for their information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4278"/>When any of the children were away from home, it was our mother chiefly who kept us supplied with the family news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4279"/>On the whole, the volume of my father's private correspondence was large enough to be a monument to his resolute grappling with the mechanical impediment, even if not to be compared with that of purely literary men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>I believe that this has been true in all ages and in all countries of the world, but only to a limited extent; whereas, in our own times, mediumship is multiplied indefinitely, and the number of believers in direct communication with the departed may be safely reckoned as legion, embracing persons of all ranks and conditions, from the most cultivated and refined to the most rude and ignorant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>The Old and New Testaments abound with analogous manifestations; and these we are taught from childhood to regard as unquestionable, simply because they are recorded in that particular volume&mdash;for there are no living witnesses to authenticate any of them.
