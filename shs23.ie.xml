<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>Our battery did great execution during this battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>The guns were short-range guns, and <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Rickett,,,,," id="n0281.0012.00114.01292" reg="mostcommon:Rickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Rickett</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName>, of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>The enemy's guns were rifled guns, known as <num value="10">ten</num>-pounder parrot guns, which threw elongated shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>These passed over our heads, for the most part, giving our nervous system great discomfort at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and occasionally they fell among our infantry in rear of us. The enemy's gunners had probably very little more experience than our gunners had in actual firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>Ours were men of intelligence and coolness, who estimated the distance of the target at which they were firing, who knew the point-blank range of their own guns, and quickly learned to give such slight elevation as was necessary to be given; whereas the rifled guns opposed to us had a very long range, and, without some depression, carried their charges far over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>Their gunners seemed never to have discovered their error.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>We were surprised, no doubt many of us, at several experiences of that day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>We had anxiously arranged what persons should help the drivers to hold them, but we soon discovered that they did not need holding, except to keep them from getting tangled in their harness in their efforts to eat the bunches of poor grass which were near them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>The battle was raging as we went into position&mdash;musketry and artillery of the enemy making fearful noises above and around us, but the horses seemed as calm as if they had been used to it all their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>Their calmness reassured some of us, probably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>We began to find out that there was a vast deal of space through which a hostile missile could find its way without having to pass through those places which our bodies occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>No horse in the battery was killed, and very few were wounded, and they but slightly, although <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> no pains were taken to protect them, as were taken in subsequent battles, when horses became scarcer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>The guns and caissons were placed in the position taken during a drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>The guns were unlimbered, and the lead-horses of the limber-chest were stationed about <measure n="14feet" type="distance">fourteen feet</measure> to the rear (horses heading toward the gun), and the lead-horses of the caissons were placed <measure n="14feet" type="distance">fourteen feet</measure> in rear of their respective limber-chests, horses toward the foot, of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>That day, whether by order of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0281.0012.00115.01293" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> or not, the guns were served with ammunition from the rear chests of the caissons, and not from the limber-chests of their respective guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>(Mine was not. I carried all the ammunition in my piece-field.)</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>He was on horseback, and at the sound of the ball he lowered his head, following an impulse which is almost universal in such circumstances, and his head was shot off. This was a greater shock to us than if it had occurred in the heat of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>At about <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time> in the afternoon, the crowds on the levee were startled by the approach of the <name n="United States">Yankee</name> boats and the landing by them of <num value="1">one</num> of our citizens.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>The pit in which this gun had been placed was on the crest of a hill projecting considerably in advance of a straight continuation of our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>Between this hill and the town the ground was boggy, and there was no infantry nor artillery in our immediate front&mdash;nothing but <persName n="Washington,Mrs.,,,," id="n0281.0018.00199.02621" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Robert,J.,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>'s tomb offering food for meditation, which few, if any, indulged in at that time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>As the heavy fog of that morning disappeared we beheld the enemy debouching from the town, forming in line and marching bravely to the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>Until we saw them advancing, we had no idea of the splendid position of that gun. It could enfilade them as easy as rolling off a log&mdash;and it did it with a hearty good will.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>The enemy was not slow in perceiving this, and to silence that gun became object worthy of their attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>To accomplish this the heavy guns on <persName n="Stafford,,,,," id="n0281.0018.00199.02622" reg="mostcommon:Stafford,nomatch:0"><surname>Stafford</surname></persName>'s heights began to pay us their respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>If only <num value="1">one</num> of their shells had fallen in our pit it would have silenced many a voice besides that of our gun.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>Presently a battery of <num value="6">six</num> guns sallied forth from the town, and appearing in our front, began to play on us. We let it play on, preferring the enfilading game, which was more interesting and more profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>According to <persName n="Ransom,General,,,," id="n0281.0018.00199.02623" reg="mostcommon:Ransom,M.,W.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ransom</surname></persName>'s report this battery was reinforced by another of <num value="4">four</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>We did not count them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>A little later a number of sharpshooters from many windows before us began to send us those little bullets which kill more men than your big cannon balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>These guns soon got the range on us to such a fine point that almost every shot hit the epaulement of our pit and ricochetted over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>We had now to load and fire kneeling.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>We then beheld a grand spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>Instead of falling back, like all its predecessors before the rapid and well-directed fire of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName> and our double line of infantry, <num value="1">one</num> regiment kept on advancing in the face of this storm of lead and iron.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>It kept on advancing until it had reached a declivity at the foot of <placeName reg="Marye's Hill">Marye's Hill</placeName>, where the men squatted in comparative security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>What followed is more than your humble servant can describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>He will, therefore, let the naked facts speak for themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>Having rested a moment, the commanding officer ascended that declivity, followed by his color-bearer, and within pistol-shot of the star-spangled cross the star-spangled banner waved defiantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>Raising <pb id="p.200" n="200"/> his sword, he called aloud, urging his men to follow their flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>But the flag had gone too far and they did not follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>Before so much bravery anger seemed to give way to admiration, and of those <num value="1000">thousand</num> muskets still warm with the fire which had thinned his ranks, there was but <num value="1">one</num> that had the courage to fire&mdash;and the color-bearer fell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>He was, doubtless, killed in conformity with the usages of civilized warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>Nevertheless we were sorry to see him fall, and the body of that dead enemy, lying beside the flag he had so bravely carried, formed an image which rose far above that of the living who had killed him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>If anything can ever bring reconciliation between such foes, it is the respect which such bravery must ever command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>The flag did not remain long on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>A man stepped forward and raised it. For several minutes these <num value="2">two</num> men stood on the hill, looking defiantly in the very eyes of death which glared at them from every muzzle of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>Despairing to bring his men to the assault, the officer and his solitary companion finally returned to the shelter offered by the declivity at the foot of the hill, and the threatened charge was not attempted again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>In the meantime, <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0281.0018.00200.02624" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, who had seen this advance and shelter behind that hill, apprehended the very assault which was attempted a few minutes later, and perceiving that this gun of ours was the only <num value="1">one</num> that could reach it, he sent <persName n="Latrobe,Major,Osman,,," id="n0281.0018.00200.02625" reg="default:Latrobe,Osman,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Osman</foreName> <surname>Latrobe</surname></persName>, ordering the commanding officer thereof to direct his fire against that body of the enemy in order to dislodge it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>But to execute this order, it was necessary, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, to move the gun out of the pit, because it could not be depressed within range of the objective point without bringing the muzzle below the epaulement and against the wall of the pit. And to take it out at this moment was tantamount to sending it, with its whole detachment, to almost certain destruction without hardly any hope of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>But even to move it out could not be done unless it were done between shots, and to do this between shots was almost impossible, because these shots were following each other so rapidly that they shut us down, as it were, under solid bars of iron projectiles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>So far we had had a pic-nic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>So far it had been child's play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/><pb id="p.201" n="201"/></p> 
<p>It is simple justice to say there was not a man who went out of that pit without believing he was going out to die&mdash;and yet they went without hesitation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>And they succeeded in getting that gun out; but, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>they did not succeed in getting out between shots, for as they merged above ground the next shot came and, bursting in their midst, killed as good and brave a man as ever lived&mdash;<persName n="Linossier,,Claudius,,," id="n0281.0018.00201.02626" reg="default:Linossier,Claudius,,,"><foreName>Claudius</foreName> <surname>Linossier</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>Wonderful to relate, it killed no other, wounded none, and left our gun uninjured and ready to do its duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>And well did it do its duty, for our good gunner, <persName n="Morelli,,Tomasso,,," id="n0281.0018.00201.02627" reg="default:Morelli,Tomasso,,,"><foreName>Tomasso</foreName> <surname>Morelli</surname></persName>, did not miss a single shot, which, even now, we can see plowing those brave men huddled up behind that hill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>By taking that gun on the open hill it had been raised about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> above and moved some <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> to the right of its former position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>Our opponents, therefore, had to alter their aim accordingly.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>The gun was loaded for the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> time when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot that struck it knocked it down and wounded nearly every man except <persName n="Latrobe,Major,,,," id="n0281.0018.00201.02628" reg="nearbymention:Latrobe,Osman,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Latrobe</surname></persName>, our young lieutenant and <num value="5">No. 5</num>, who was getting the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> round from an ammunition chest in the pit.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>Indeed, some of these writers, especially when they are autobiographers, have developed a degree of military capacity, judgment, and skill, when writing in the light of their present knowledge of facts, which has astounded those who knew them when they were obliged to act upon information derived from the picket-line, from reconnoissances, from scouts, from citizens, from deserters, and other sources of knowledge upon which those in charge of military movements are <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> often obliged to depend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>Those who enjoy the great advantage of a full knowledge of facts in writing of what they advised or did, it will be seen, are usually very positive, and are always right; but so far as what is called the truth of history is concerned, their narratives of what they advised or planned or of what they did, it must be confessed, sometimes do violence to the actual facts.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4244"/>We could see them passing a small opening in the timber, but could not make them out. All at once above the steady roll of musketry in our front, there broke out the most awful blended roar of artillery and musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4252"/>I will relate only <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4253"/>We had in our company a rather stupid fellow, whose father had sent along with him an old darkey with a hunchback, known as <q direct="unspecified"><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>,</q> and who cooked for the mess of which this young fellow was a member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4255"/>Whilst we were lying down as before described, with the conflict raging fearfully just in front, and shot and shell occasionally ploughing through our ranks, but mostly passing over us, this youth began to pray aloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4256"/>He seemed to be at a great loss what to say (I fear his early education had been neglected); so he began: <q direct="unspecified">Oh, <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, if <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> was here!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4265"/>It was pitiful to witness his dread of the future and hear him talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/>Instead of deriding and scoffing at what seemed to be his craven nature, the man's evident sincerity and distress excited our compassion, and we tried to comfort him, telling him it was like taking a plunge in a cold bath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4272"/>They had lost all semblance of organization, and reminded me of nothing so much as a swarm of bees shaken down on the ground before a hive and making all possible speed to get into it, with much humming and buzzing, climbing over each other in their haste to get inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> Recital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/>That the property proposed to be restored was captured from the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, non-combatants and others, after it had been abandoned by them, and was sold and covered into the <name>Treasury</name>, amounting to <measure n="27000000dollars" type="currency">$27,000,000</measure>. We have no reason to doubt the truth of this proposition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/><num value="2">2</num>. That the chaotic condition of affairs in the <rs>South</rs> after the surrender prevented the reclamation at the time of the captured, abandoned property by its real owners, and that it is evident now that such claims can never be presented or sustained at this late day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>The truth of this recital, in any and all of its parts, is open to the most serious question, and, could it be established beyond peradventure, scarcely offers a basis for giving this money to any class of the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>The <num value="1">one</num> question which, in law or in morals, could in the latter event arise, is whether the captured, abandoned property belongs to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, under the law of war, or by escheat to the <name>States</name> in which that property was found in its state of abandonment.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4846"/>The allegations of this recital are correct beyond any question, but, in view of them, it does not fail to strike your committee that they offer the strongest reasons why the bill should not pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>Law and usage should not be overturned, and the wholly unconstitutional and improper attitude of granting premiums to citizens for support of the government should not be assumed by the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>. </p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>This recital undoubtedly presents a case of misery for the heartiest sympathy and for the most urgent effort in every proper quarter to relieve it. But it is very much to be doubted whether under any circumstances whatever it is the true mission of government to relieve suffering by appropriations from the public treasury, except where it has been occasioned by labor in its service; and the wisest and best men claim that such appropriations tend to produce a paternalism in government, a want of self-reliance in the citizen, which go to sap the foundations of that liberty for which our fathers and Confederate soldiers conspicuously fought and became heroes.</p></div2>

<head>Provisions of the bill.</head>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>It will be readily seen that in the case of those States which have made no provision for their disabled soldiers, no bounty is created for them, and that the principle is established that where there is the most misery there shall be the least relief, and that where the largest charity is extended it shall be rewarded by a bounty, which, in that case, would not be needed.</p>
