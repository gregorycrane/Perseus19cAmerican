<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>the greatest boon that can be bestowed upon a people is the adequate setting forth of the history of their illustrious men. The achievements of these, duly recorded, stand forth as beaconlights to guide coming generations; and as a just appreciation of greatness indicates worth in a people, and points to future advancement on their part, so surely does indifference to merited renown denote popular degeneracy and decay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>We therefore welcome every honestly meant publication concerning the struggle of the <rs>South</rs> for independence &mdash; a struggle replete with acts of heroic valor, and resplendent with examples of self-sacrifice, fortitude, and virtue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Few, even now, are the remaining leaders of the great contest through which we have passed; and, as time goes on, gradually diminishing their number, the day approaches when nothing will be left of them except a memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The Southern people, shackled by years of poverty and political helplessness, and circumscribed as they are in their sphere of action, cannot forget the teachings which, to them and to their posterity, embody the true meaning of our institutions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In recording the causes for which the <rs>South</rs> armed and sent to the field her manhood and her youth, and in holding up before the public mind the great ability of some of her leaders, the devotion of all, we not only perform a sacred duty to our country and those who will come after us, but mark out the way for them to that peace, liberty, and prosperity which we failed to attain for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>His calling for a military career was there clearly manifested.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>I had, from the very beginning of the struggle, been more impressed with the vital importance of the seaports than with anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>I regarded them as the lungs of the country, which, once really closed, asphyxia must follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>I therefore took an early occasion to go to <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to see what could be had in the shape of vessels fit to take and keep the sea, for a lengthened period, and strong enough to carry an armament which would render them efficient war-vessels, or, at all events, equal to cope with those of the enemy engaged in the blockade of the coast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>I was fortunate in finding exactly what was wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>A fleet of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class East-Indiamen was lying there idle, under circumstances of a financial nature which made them available to a buyer at less than half their cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>They had been built with a view of being armed if required, and also to be used as transports for troops, as well as to carry valuable cargoes and treasure in time of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/><num value="4">Four</num> of them were vessels of great size and power, and of the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, and there were <num value="6">six</num> others which, although smaller, were scarcely inferior for the required purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Having, with the assistance of an expert, thoroughly inspected them all, I at once entered into negotiations for their purchase, and having secured them for the reply of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> I submitted the proposal, in a letter to <persName n="Trenholm,the Honorable,G.,A.,," id="n0136.0006.00060.00545" reg="expanded:Trenholm,George,A.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Trenholm</surname></persName>, who referred it, as I believe,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>The total cost of buying, arming, and fitting-out the <num value="10">ten</num> ships was estimated at <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of pounds, to put the fleet on the coast ready for action; a sum which would have been covered by <measure n="40000barrels" type="mass">forty thousand bales</measure> of cotton, out of the <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of bales which the government had, at that time, under their hand, and which would not have cost them, at 6d. in their own currency, more than <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>There would have been little or no difficulty in getting the ships to sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>I have always understood that the proposition was considered and rejected by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>, but I never had any communication from them on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Although much disappointed at this result, so convinced was I of the value of the ships that I determined to retain my hold upon them as long as possible, to prevent their being sold elsewhere, and in hope that other counsels would prevail at home before it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>By means of negotiations which it is not necessary to detail here, I did succeed in retaining control of them until the occurrence of the <quote><hi rend="italics"><persName n="Trent,,,,," id="n0136.0006.00060.00549" reg="mostcommon:Trent,nomatch:0"><surname>Trent</surname></persName></hi> outrage;</quote> when the <rs>British</rs> government, requiring immediately ships of this class for transportation of troops and war-material to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, the owners broke off the negotiations with me, and got the ships, or many of them, employed in this service, in which they remained until there was no further need of them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/><hi rend="italics">Dear Sir</hi>,&mdash;I arrived here on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> at <time value="2pm">2 P. M.</time>, and immediately examined the site of this encampment and the plans of its proposed defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>The former is in an open country, traversed by good roads in every direction, without any strong natural features for the purposes of defence, and without running water nearer than <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, except a few small springs at half that distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The plans of the works are good, but too extensive to be finished in less than <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, and cannot be garrisoned with less than from <num value="3000">three</num> to <num value="4000">four thousand</num> men. As this position can be turned in every direction by an enemy, for the purpose of destroying the railroads intended to be defended by it, it becomes a question whether these works could be held more than a few days, when thus isolated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>I have reconnoitred closely several of the fords on <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and <num value="1">one</num> on <placeName reg="Occoquan Run">Occoquan Run</placeName> (about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from here), which offer strong natural features of defence, but they are so numerous and far apart, that only a much larger force than I have here at my command (say not less than <num value="10000">ten</num> to <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men) could hope to defend them all, against a well-organized enemy of about <num value="20000">20,000</num> men, who could select his point of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>I must therefore either be reinforced at once, as I have not more than about <num value="6000">six thousand</num> effective men; or I must be prepared to retire (upon the approach of the enemy) in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 51" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, with the intention of arresting him whenever and wherever the opportunity presents itself; or I must march to meet him at <num value="1">one</num> of said fords, to sell our lives as dearly as practicable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Badly armed and badly equipped as my command is at present (several regiments having but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> field officers), and having hardly any means of transportation, it would be expecting too much, that I could meet successfully the foe who is preparing to attack us in a few days, with all the advantages of number, arms, and discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>From what precedes it is easy to see why <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> did not naturally afford a strong defensive line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>In fact, the ground on the <rs>Federal</rs> side of the run commanded, in most places, the ground occupied by the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>Still, <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, as a strategic point, was <num value="1">one</num> of superior importance, as it secured communication with the valley of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and the <orgName n="Army of the Shenandoah" type="army">army of the Shenandoah</orgName>, <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> under <persName n="Johnston,General,Joseph,E.,," id="n0136.0007.00071.00642" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>But it was with great difficulty that, at this period, work on the fortifications could be procured from the troops, as most of their time was necessarily taken up with drills, and manual labor was in itself no light task for them, composed, as the commands generally were, of young men of good position at home, who had responded to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call of the country, many of them having come with no small amount of luggage and even with body-servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Their answer to company officers was, that they were there to fight, and not to handle the pick and shovel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Appreciating such a feeling in men of their position, new to arduous duties of that kind, and wishing to avoid whatever might at that moment cause disaffection, <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0136.0007.00071.00644" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> abstained from employing them on any but the most essential works, and procured, as far as possible, negro labor, which was furnished at his call, by the comparatively small number of slave-owners of the <placeName reg="Piedmont, Augusta, Virginia" key="tgn,2113636">Piedmont</placeName> region of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, with great readiness.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>As soon as new regiments arrived they were armed and equipped as well as the means at hand allowed, and at once drilled and organized into brigades.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>This organization of an army, out of troops for the most part wholly undisciplined, in the presence of an enemy composed of a well-trained militia, superior in numbers and thoroughly appointed, whose threatened advance was expected at every moment, apart from being in itself a difficult and anxious task, was beset with obstacles resulting from the narrow methods, slowness, and, in some respects, unaccountable mismanagement, of the authorities at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 51" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>adding, that this was a question of vital importance, upon which the success or failure of our cause might depend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>This question brought on discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>The precise conversation which followed I do not propose to give: it was not an argument; there seemed to be little difference of opinion between us in regard to general views and principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>It was clearly stated and agreed to, that the military force of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was at the highest point it could attain without arms from abroad; that the portion of this particular army present for duty was in the finest fighting condition; that, if kept inactive, it must retrograde immensely in every respect <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> during the winter, the effect of which was foreseen and dreaded by us all. The enemy were daily increasing in numbers, arms, discipline, and efficiency &mdash;we looked forward to a sad state of things at the opening of a spring campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>These and other points being agreed upon without argument, it was again asked, <quote><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, is it not possible to increase the effective strength of this army, and put us in condition to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> and carry the war into the enemy's country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>Can you not, by stripping other points to the last they will bear, and even risking defeat at all other places, put us in condition to move forward?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>Success here at this time saves everything, defeat here loses all.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>In explanation, and as an illustration of this, the unqualified opinion was advanced, that if, for want of adequate strength on our part in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, the <rs>Federal</rs> forces should take military possession of that whole State, and even enter and occupy a portion of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, that a victory gained by this army beyond the <rs>Potomac</rs> would, by threatening the heart of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, compel their armies to fall back, free <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and give us the line of the <rs>Ohio</rs> within <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> thereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>Similar views were expressed in regard to ultimate results, in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, being dependent upon the success or failure of this army; and various other special illustrations were offered&mdash;showing, in short, that success here was success everywhere; defeat here, defeat everywhere; and that this was the point upon which all the available force of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> should be concentrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>It seemed to be conceded by all that our force, at that time here, was not sufficient for assuming the offensive beyond the <rs>Potomac</rs>; and that, even with a much larger force, an attack upon their army, under the guns of their fortifications on this side of the river, was out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> asked me what number of men were necessary, in my opinion, to warrant an offensive campaign, to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs>, cut off the communication of the enemy with their fortified capital, and carry the war into their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>In this connection there was some discussion of the difficulties to be overcome, and the probabilities of success, but no <num value="1">one</num> questioned the disastrous results of remaining inactive throughout the winter.

<p>Notwithstanding the belief that many in the <rs>Northern</rs> army were opposed on principle to invading the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and that they would fight better in defending their own homes than in attacking ours, it was believed that the best, if not the only place, to insure success, was to concentrate our forces, and attack the enemy in their own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>The president, I think, gave no definite opinion in regard to the number of men necessary for that purpose, and I am sure that no <num value="1">one</num> present considered this a question to be finally decided by any other person than the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>Returning to the question that had been twice asked, the <rs>President</rs> expressed surprise and regret that the number of surplus arms here was so small; and, I thought, spoke bitterly of this disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>He then stated, that, at that time, <hi rend="italics">no reinforcement could be furnished to this army of the character asked for</hi>, and that the most that could be done would be to furnish recruits to take the surplus arms in store here (say <num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> stand). That the whole country was demanding protection at his hands, and praying for arms and troops for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>He had long been expecting arms from abroad, but had been disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>He still hoped to get them, but had no positive assurance that they would be received at all. The manufacture of arms in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was as yet undeveloped to any considerable extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Want of arms was the great difficulty; he could not take any troops from the points named, and, without arms from abroad, could not reinforce this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>He expressed regret, and seemed to feel deeply, as did every <num value="1">one</num> present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>When the <rs>President</rs> had thus clearly and positively stated his inability to put this army in the condition deemed by the general necessary before entering upon an active offensive campaign, it was felt that it might be better to run the risk of almost certain destruction, fighting upon the other side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, rather than see the gradual dying-out and deterioration of this army during a winter at the end of which the term of enlistment of half the force would expire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>The prospect of a spring campaign, to be commenced under such discouraging circumstances, was rendered all the more gloomy by the daily increasing strength of an enemy already much superior in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>On the other hand was the hope and expectation that before the end of winter arms would be introduced into the country; and all were confident that we could then not only protect our own country, but successfully invade that of the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>If they did not advance we had but <hi rend="italics">to await the winter and its results</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>After the main question was dropped, the <rs>President</rs> proposed that, instead of an active offensive campaign, we should attempt certain partial operations &mdash;a sudden blow against <persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n0136.0012.00144.01588" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName> or <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0136.0012.00144.01589" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, or to break the bridge over the <rs>Monocacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>This, he thought, besides injuring the enemy, would exert a good influence over our troops, and encourage the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>In any case the difficulty of crossing large bodies over wide rivers, in the vicinity of an enemy, and then recrossing, made such expeditions hazardous; it was agreed, however, that if any opportunity should occur, offering reasonable chances of success, that the attempt would be made.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>An acquaintance with the history of the military establishment and organization of the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would have protected the <rs type="role" reg="Acting-Secretary">Acting Secretary</rs> from this misapprehension, as he would have then known in what way, during the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, a rocket battery was organized for the field, with the army under <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0136.0013.00159.01742" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>. . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>But in this very matter, it so happens I did not act without consultation with all proper authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>Assured of the difficulties in getting field guns in any adequate number for the exigency, and convinced of the value of war rockets against such troops as our adversaries have, I despatched an officer of my staff&mdash;<persName n="Alexander,Captain,E.,P.,," id="n0136.0013.00159.01743" reg="default:Alexander,E.,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Alexander</surname></persName>&mdash;last <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 51" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, to consult and arrange measures with the proper departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>It so happened that a valuable officer, by circumstances thrown out of employment, was available, and thought to be particularly fitted for the command of a rocket battery; while it was believed that he could readily recruit a company without subtracting from our already too weak army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>I am quite willing, indeed, that you shall decide whose <hi rend="italics"><quote>judgment</quote> </hi> has been most at fault&mdash;that of your general, who has simply done what was <hi rend="italics">essential</hi> to provide men to handle the rockets as soon as ready for use, and thus materially increase his means of defence and ability to maintain our imperilled cause; or that of the functionary at his desk, who deems it a fit time to weave technical pleas of obstruction, to debate about the prerogative of his office and of your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>'s, and to write lectures on law while the enemy is mustering in our front, with at least <num value="3">three</num> times our force in infantry, and <num value="4">four</num> times as much artillery.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>Our answer is, that a modification of the original plan had to <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> be resorted to, but was suggested&mdash;as had been the plan itself&mdash;by <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0136.0015.00195.02189" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, and by no other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>Be this as it may, the fact is not the less plain that the new plan, or the modification of the original <num value="1">one</num>, was conceived and offered by <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0136.0015.00195.02203" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, and merely adopted by <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0015.00195.02204" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>If the plan was unwise, why had he approved it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>If it was judicious&mdash;as he must have thought it&mdash;why does he afterwards cast a shadow of censure over it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>Then, why should he lead the readers of his report and of his book to the erroneous belief that his was the controlling spirit directing each and every incident of the battle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>We can imagine only <num value="1">one</num> set of conditions under which the frustration of the modified plan might have been a fortunate occurrence, and that is, that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0015.00196.02209" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, who was ignorant, as he admits, of the surrounding country, and had but superficially examined that plan, should himself have undertaken to carry it into operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>That the commands got very much broken and mixed up during the battle was not surprising, and was due less to the order of battle than to the rawness of the troops, including officers, the broken and wooded nature of the field, and the severity of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/><pb id="p.330" n="330"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>It must be remembered that the <rs>Confederates</rs> had no accurate knowledge of the ground occupied by the <rs>Federals</rs>, and they had no proper staff officers to make the necessary reconnoissances, if practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>The expedition was intended to be a surprise, and they feared to arouse the suspicions of the enemy by a forced reconnoissance: hence, they preferred to take the risk attending an imperfect knowledge of the ground over which they had to operate, rather than incur the danger of giving timely warning of the attack to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>Having completed my channel-defences and batteries in the harbor, necessary for the reduction of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, I despatched <num value="2">two</num> of my aids at <time value="2:20pm">2.20 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>I offered to transport himself and command to any port in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> he might select; to allow him to move out of the fort with company-arms and property, and all private property, and to salute his flag on lowering it. He refused to accede to this demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>As my aids were about leaving, <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0136.0027.00427.05575" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Patton,,,:2"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> remarked, <q direct="unspecified">that if we did not batter him to pieces he would be starved out in a few days,</q> or words to that effect.

<p>This being reported to me by my aids, on their return with his refusal, at <time value="5:10pm">5.10 P. M.</time>, I deemed it proper to telegraph the purport of his remark to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>If this, or its equivalent, be refused, reduce the fort as your judgment decides to be most practicable.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4897"/>It was placed in his hands at <time value="12:45am">12.45 A. M.</time>, on the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>This reply, which was open, and shown to my aids, plainly indicated that, if instructions should be received contrary to his purpose to evacuate, or he should receive his supplies, or the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops should fire on hostile troops of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or upon transports bearing the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag, containing men, munitions, and supplies designed for hostile operations against us, be would feel bound to fire upon us, and to hold possession of the fort.

Accordingly, my aids, carrying out my instructions, promptly refused to accede to the terms proposed by <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0136.0027.00428.05578" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Patton,,,:2"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, and notified him, in writing, that our batteries would open upon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in <num value="1">one</num> hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>During the day (<dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th instant</day></dateStruct>) the fire of our batteries was kept up most spiritedly, the <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> guns and mortars being worked in the coolest manner, preserving the prescribed intervals of firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>Towards evening it became evident that our fire was very effective, as the enemy was driven from his barbette guns, which he had attempted to work in the morning, and his fire was confined to his casemated guns, but in a less active manner than in the morning, and it was observed that several of his guns a <hi rend="italics">barbette</hi> were disabled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>During the whole of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> our <orgName n="Mortar Battery" type="battery">mortar batteries</orgName> continued to throw shells, but, in obedience to orders, at longer intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>The night was rainy and dark, and as it was confidently expected that the <orgName n="United States fleet" type="fleet">United States fleet</orgName> would attempt to land troops upon the islands, or throw men into <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> by means of boats, the greatest vigilance was observed at all our <orgName n="Channel Battery" type="battery">channel batteries</orgName>, and by our troops on both <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris</placeName> and <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's islands</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>About <time value="8am">8 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> continued to fire from time to time, but at long and irregular intervals, amid the dense smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>Our brave troops, carried away by their enthusiasm, mounted the different batteries, and, at every discharge from the fort, cheered the garrison for its pluck and gallantry, and hooted at the fleet lying inactive just outside the bar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>Before my aids reached the fort the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag was displayed on the parapets, but remained there only a short time when it was hauled down and a white flag substituted in its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>Upon the arrival of my aids at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> they delivered their message to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0136.0027.00429.05582" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Patton,,,:2"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, who replied <q direct="unspecified">that he thanked <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00429.05583" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> for his offer, but desired no assistance.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5009"/>I beg, therefore, respectfully to suggest that, after leaving a sufficient guard for the batteries, say <num value="500">five hundred</num> men, it will be better for me to march with the great body of my command to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 18" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, or some other point, where they can be made available to resist the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great onslaught of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5790"/></p> 
<p>It was generally believed by those with whom I was in the habit of conversing, just after the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, that some of the <rs>Federal</rs> regiments bore Confederate colors in the action, and Northern papers contained similar accusations against us. This led to observation of the difficulty of distinguishing the colors of the armies from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5791"/>On that account I attempted to procure, from the different Southern States, State flags for their regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5792"/>Only the <rs>Virginia</rs> regiments were supplied in this way, however, when, you and other leading officers concurring as to the necessity, I determined to have colors made by the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5793"/>Many designs, drawn by members of the army, were offered&mdash;most by you. All of them were oblong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5794"/>I selected <num value="1">one</num> of those you offered, but changed the shape to square, and fixed the size: colors of infantry to be <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure>, of artillery <num value="3">three</num>, and standards to be <num value="2.5">two and a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5795"/>They were then made by the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName> as soon as practicable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5796"/>I had no conference or correspondence with the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> or civilians on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5797"/>My recollection is that it was an <hi rend="italics">ar</hi>my<hi rend="italics"></hi> affair, and, when questioned on the subject, I have always said so.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5798"/>I have no particular confidence in my memory, but this subject has been so often talked of in my presence, both during and since the war, that I believe that I am not far wrong in my recollection of my own agency in this matter, such conversations having prevented me from forgetting circumstances not important enough to be thought of otherwise.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5926"/>General,&mdash;In answer to your note of yesterday, I have the honor to submit the following statement:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5927"/>Some time in the winter of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, it was represented, at a meeting of the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName> of the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">Provisional Congress</orgName>, that the aspect of affairs in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> was discouraging to our cause, and that your presence in that quarter was extremely desirable, as well by reason of the confidence with which the circumstance would inspire the public, as the efficiency which it would probably impart to the operations of our forces on that theatre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5928"/>Yielding to these suggestions, the committee unanimously agreed that an effort should be made to procure your transfer to the <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">Army of the West</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5929"/>To that <pb id="p.491" n="491"/> end, I was directed to consult the <rs>President</rs> on the propriety of the measure, and, in case he should approve it, I was requested to solicit your own acquiescence in the transfer.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5931"/>I remember you evinced the greatest reluctance to be detached from the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, but, yielding at last to my earnest importunities, urged with an exclusive reference to the public interest, and supported by the written entreaties and arguments of representatives from the <name>States</name> chiefly concerned, you were pleased to give a qualified assent to the proposed transfer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5932"/>What your conditions were, I find it impossible, after so long a lapse of time, to recollect with sufficient particularity to affirm with an absolute assurance of correctness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/>My impression, however, is that they were such as you represent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5934"/>Whatever they were, I understood the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary of War">Honorable Secretary of War</rs> to agree to them, and I telegraphed you accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5989"/>It was known to me, on the day before, that the enemy had reconnoitred the roads leading to <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Bailey's Ferry">Bailey's Ferry</placeName>, by way of <placeName key="tgn,2059197" n="1.000 3" reg="iron mountain, saint francois, missouri">Iron Mountain</placeName> Furnace; and at <time value="10am">10 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6003"/>The work itself was well built; it was completed long before I took command, but strengthened greatly by myself in building embrasures and epaulments of sand-bags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>I hesitated not a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>My infantry, artillery, and cavalry, removed, of necessity, to avoid the fire of the gunboats, to the outworks, could not meet the enemy there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6048"/>The character of the country in the rear and to the left of the fort is such as to make it dangerous to concentrate our whole force there; for, if their gunboats should pass the fort and command the river, our troops would be in danger of being cut off by a force from the <rs>Tennessee</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6138"/>It is true there is a nominal organization into <q direct="unspecified">divisions</q> formed of other subdivisions called <q direct="unspecified">brigades,</q> but upon no regular basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6259"/>To which end it was decided that the main force in occupation of <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus</placeName> should fall back upon <placeName reg="Humboldt, Gibson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099671">Humboldt</placeName>, and thence, if need be, to <placeName reg="Grand Junction, Hardeman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099329">Grand Junction</placeName>, so as to protect <placeName key="tgn,7017750" n="1.000 5" reg="memphis, shelby, tennessee">Memphis</placeName> from either point, and still secure a line of retreat to the latter place or <placeName reg="Grenada, Grenada, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056541">Grenada, Mississippi</placeName>, or even to <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0136.0027.00508.06911" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,J.,R.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, of that State.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6752"/>On the evening and night of the <dateStruct value="-04-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs>, after the order had been given to cease firing, and all was quiet along our lines, all, or nearly all, of the general officers came to headquarters, where I mingled freely among them; heard from them accounts of the many moving incidents of the day, the death of many good and brave men, the capture and flight of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/>But on that evening, although all admitted the victory was not complete, yet I heard no <num value="1">one</num> express the slightest discontent with your order to cease firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>On the contrary, the impression left on my mind, of which I have a vivid recollection, by their conversation, was, that our troops had all done well, and had accomplished all that could have been expected, and that we were masters of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6755"/>I certainly heard no <num value="1">one</num> say that if he had not been called off he could have won for himself and his troops any additional laurels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6756"/>On that evening I heard no criticism of the order to cease firing, and I feel confident there was none in any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6757"/>I am further satisfied now, and always have been, that all complaints of your drawing off the troops on the evening of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> were after-thoughts, and especially with the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6758"/>Because, until the fact was well established that the enemy, during that night, received an additional aid of more than <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> fresh troops, no such thought seemed to have occurred to any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6759"/>After that, however, many began to say it would have been far better for us to have attempted to complete our work on the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6760"/>Some of the general officers began to say we could have done more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6761"/>But I have never thought that such was their opinion the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6762"/>The exhausted condition of our troops, their disorganization, derangement, and straggling were fearfully great, and I have never believed that their worried, hungry, and disorganized bands, though flushed with victory, could have silenced <orgName n="batteries"><persName n="Buell,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00536.07350" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buell</surname></persName>'s batteries</orgName>, which were brought into the action on the evening of the <dateStruct value="--6"><day reg="6">6th</day></dateStruct>, and I do not think any of our generals thought so then.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6767"/><hi rend="italics">My dear Sir</hi>,&mdash;Your letter of <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th instant</day></dateStruct> came to hand a few days since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6768"/>In answer to which I beg to say that your letter of last autumn did not reach me, or it should have been promptly answered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6769"/>About <num value="1">1</num> <num value=".5">1/2</num> h., an hour before his fall, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00536.07356" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> moved around to about the centre of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00536.07357" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,John,C.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, upon our extreme right, and for about <num value="3">three</num> quarters of an hour occupied a position immediately in rear of General <pb id="p.537" n="537"/> <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07358" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,John,C.,,:3"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName>'s line, where a very hard fight was going on. Exposed to a galling fire, our line held its position steadily, but at very considerable cost, until finally <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07359" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> decided to order and lead a charge from that position upon the line of the enemy that confronted us. He rode to the front, talked to the troops a moment or <num value="2">two</num>, ordered and led the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6770"/>The enemy's line gave away before us, and we advanced, I should think, <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a mile, and established our line on a ridge parallel to the <num value="1">one</num> we had left, meeting a galling fire from the enemy while thus re-establishing our line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6771"/>Just as our line had been established and dressed, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07360" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> called my attention to the fact that the sole of <num value="1">one</num> of his boots had been cut by a ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6772"/>I asked him, somewhat eagerly, <q direct="unspecified">Are yon wounded; did the ball touch your foot?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6773"/>He said, <q direct="unspecified">No;</q> and was proceeding to make an additional remark, when a battery of the enemy opened fire from a position to our left, which enfiladed our line in its then position, when he said to me, <q direct="unspecified">Order <persName n="Statham,Colonel,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07361" reg="mostcommon:Statham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Statham</surname></persName> to wheel his regiment to the left, charge, and take that battery.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6774"/>I galloped immediately to <persName n="Statham,Colonel,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07362" reg="mostcommon:Statham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Statham</surname></persName>, about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure>, and gave the order, and galloped immediately back to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07363" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, who was sitting upon his horse where I had left him, a few feet in rear of our line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6775"/>Riding up to his right side, I said, <q direct="unspecified">General, your order is delivered, and <persName n="Statham,Colonel,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07364" reg="mostcommon:Statham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Statham</surname></persName> is in motion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6776"/>As I was saying this, he leaned from me in a manner that impressed me with the idea that he was falling from his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6777"/>I instantly extended my left arm around his neck, grasping his coatcollar, and pulling him towards me until I righted him up in the saddle; and, stooping forward so that I could look him in the face, I asked him, <q direct="unspecified">General, are you wounded?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6778"/>He said, <q direct="unspecified">Yes, and I fear seriously.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6779"/>At this moment his rein dropped from his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6780"/>Holding him with my left hand, I caught up his rein with my right, in which I held my own, and guided both horses to a depression about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> in rear of the line, where I took him off his horse, having asked <persName n="Wickham,Captain,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07365" reg="mostcommon:Wickham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, just as I was leaving the line, to bring me a surgeon at the earliest moment possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6781"/>I am satisfied that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07366" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> did not live exceeding <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure> after he was taken from his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6782"/>I did not look at my watch at the time, but my best impression is that it was <num value="2">2</num> <num value=".5">1/2</num> or <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P. M.</time> when he died.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6783"/>* * * * * *</p> 
<p>Just as he was breathing his last, and when he was unconscious, <persName n="Preston,General,William,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07367" reg="default:Preston,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName> joined me, and <persName n="Preston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07368" reg="nearbymention:Preston,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName> and I agreed that <persName n="Preston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07369" reg="nearbymention:Preston,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName> should remain with the remains and attend them back to headquarters, and that I should go immediately to you and report the fact of his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6784"/>My own horse having run off when I dismounted, I took <num value="1">one</num> of <orgName n="horse"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07370" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s horse</orgName>s from his orderly, who was near by, and galloped to you near <placeName reg="North Shiloh church">North Shiloh church</placeName>, and reported to you the fact of his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6785"/>Having reported to you the fact, I rode off, but returned in a few moments and said to you, <q direct="unspecified">I came here as a volunteer aid to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00537.07371" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>; as he has fallen, I no longer have any duties to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6786"/>I intend to remain until the battle is over, and would like to be useful, if there are duties that you can assign me to.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6794"/>The distance from <placeName reg="Shiloh, Madison, Georgia" key="tgn,2659270">Shiloh church</placeName>, where I left you, I should judge was between <num value="1">one</num> and <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6796"/>My impression is that they were, or had been, conferring about the disposition of the troops when I rode up and joined them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6797"/>I cannot say what <orgName>brigade of <persName n="Ruggles,,,,," id="n0136.0027.00538.07380" reg="mostcommon:Ruggles,Daniel,,,:3"><surname>Ruggles</surname></persName></orgName>'s <orgName n="division">division</orgName> was in our immediate front, but I am confident none of the troops in that immediate quarter were in offensive action at that moment; for I only remember hearing a dropping fire of musketry, and not the regular roll of a line of battle in action-which, once heard, is ever after easily recognized.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6798"/>I communicated your order to <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00538.07381" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,B.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> in the exact words I had received it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6799"/>I replied in the affirmative, and we left the front, riding towards the point where I had parted with you, and where I had left you in conversation with <persName n="Prentiss,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00538.07387" reg="mostcommon:Prentiss,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> (Federal prisoner, lately captured) beside the rivulet which flowed at the base of the hill, in rear of <placeName reg="Shiloh chapel">Shiloh chapel</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6800"/>* * * * * *</p> 
<p>After giving him the order, as before remarked, I remained by his side until we started together to join you. I met some broken bodies of troops retiring from the conflict, as I went forward; <num value="1">one</num> I remember especially, which some of the men informed me was a Kentucky regiment, without ammunition, and its organization almost lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6801"/>When I reached <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00538.07388" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,B.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, the troops appeared to me to be substantially at a standstill, judging from the character of the firing and the condition of things presented to my view.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6802"/>* * * * * * *</p> 
<p>After transmitting your order to his division commanders, we left the front together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6803"/>From some cause or other, which I cannot at present call to mind, I became detached from <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00538.07389" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,B.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> during our ride; but I have a distinct recollection of again joining him before he met you, for I perfectly remember <pb id="p.539" n="539"/> walking with him, after dismounting, to the spot where you were standing, and calling his attention to the fact that he was in your presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6804"/>It was quite dark, and he was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> unable to distinguish you. The darkness settles in my mind the time of our return to your headquarters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6805"/>* * * * * * * *</p> 
<p>The distance from <placeName reg="Shiloh chapel">Shiloh chapel</placeName> to the point where I joined <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00539.07390" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,B.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> (as stated) must have been between <num value="1">one</num> and <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>. I recollect, in carrying the order to him, that I crossed the line of fire of the <rs>Federal</rs> gunboats, both going and returning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6806"/>They were shelling the woods at the points where they supposed our people were engaged with their comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6807"/>I should judge that our front must have been quite <num value="0.5">a half</num> a mile in advance of this line of fire, which seemed to me harmless, and doing no hurt beyond scaring horses and unsteadying a few men unaccustomed to <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6808"/>Ceaseless comment has turned upon the execution and propriety of this momentous order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6809"/>Were it necessary, it would not be difficult to show that, at that particular juncture, a proper alignment of our own disordered columns was essential, yea, of vital necessity to the existence of that army; and that the strictures and innuendoes which have for years been spread broadcast throughout this land, blaming you for the loss of that battle, are unjust and without any real foundation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6810"/>But why speculate upon the probable result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6811"/>It is in evidence, from the reports of division, brigade, and regimental commanders, that every effort to dislodge the enemy from their last stronghold, defended by <num value="40">forty</num> guns, placed in position by <persName n="Webster,Colonel,,,," id="n0136.0027.00539.07391" reg="mostcommon:Webster,J.,D.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, of the <name>Regular</name> (Federal) army, and fought under his immediate eye, proved abortive.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6844"/>It was after <time value="6pm">6 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6845"/>Darkness was close at hand, officers and men were exhausted by a combat of over <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure> without food, and jaded by the march of the preceding day through mud and water; it was therefore impossible to collect the rich and opportune spoils of war scattered broadcast on the field left in our possession, and impracticable to make any effective disposition for their removal to the rear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6846"/>I accordingly established my headquarters at the church of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, in the enemy's encampments, with <persName n="Bragg,Major-General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00542.07420" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,B.,,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, and directed our troops to sleep on their arms, in such positions in advance and rear as corps commanders should determine; hoping, from news received by a special despatch, that delays had been encountered by <persName n="Buell,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00542.07421" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buell</surname></persName> in his march from <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>, and that his main force, therefore, could not reach the field of battle in time to save <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00542.07422" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s shattered, fugitive forces from capture or destruction on the following day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6847"/>During the night the rain fell in torrents, adding to the discomforts and harassed condition of the men; the enemy, moreover, had broken their rest by a discharge, at measured intervals, of heavy shell thrown from the gunboats; therefore, on the following morning the troops under my command were not in condition to cope with an equal force of fresh troops, armed and equipped like our adversary, in the immediate possession of his depots, and sheltered by such an auxiliary as the enemy's gunboats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6848"/>About <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-04-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, however, a hot fire of musketry and artillery, opened from the enemy's quarter on our advanced line, assured me of the junction of his forces, and soon the battle raged with a fury which satisfied me I was attacked by a largely superior force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6849"/>But from the onset our troops, notwithstanding our fatigue and losses from the battle of the day before, exhibited the most cheering, veteran-like steadiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6850"/>On the right and centre the enemy was repulsed in every attempt he made with his heavy columns in that quarter of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6851"/>On the left, however, and nearest to the points of arrival of his reinforcements, he drove forward line after line of <pb id="p.543" n="543"/> his fresh troops, which were met by a courage and resolution of which our country may be proudly hopeful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6852"/>Again and again our troops were brought to the charge, invariably to win the position already in issue, invariably to drive back this foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6853"/>Accordingly, after <time value="1pm">1 P. M.</time>, I determined to withdraw from so unequal a conflict, securing such of the results of the victory of the day before as was then practicable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6854"/><rs type="role" reg="Officer">Officers</rs> of my staff were immediately despatched with the necessary orders to make the best disposition for a deliberate, orderly withdrawal from the field, and to collect, and post, a reserve to meet the enemy, should he attempt to push after us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6855"/>About <time value="2pm">2 o'clock P. M.</time> the lines in advance, which had repulsed the enemy in their last fierce assault on our left and centre, received the orders to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6856"/>This was done with uncommon steadiness, and the enemy made no attempt to follow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7056"/>At night you must guard against surprises by strong advance guards and pickets, and piles of wood, to which you can set fire on the approach of the enemy, to assist the fire of the fort and gunboats.

Should circumstances compel you to abandon New Madrid, be careful to take away all the <hi rend="italics">heavy</hi> guns, spike them, or destroy them; and destroy the gorge of your works, to allow our gunboats to play into them night and day occasionally, so as to prevent the enemy from using them to command the river below <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7403"/>By its abandonment, only <num value="1">one</num> of those roads could then be relied upon for that object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7404"/>If the enemy took possession of this strategic point, he would at once open his communications, by railroad, with <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2040656" n="1.000 206" reg="paducah, mccracken, kentucky">Paducah</placeName>, in his rear, and <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville</placeName>, on his left flank, and thus relieve himself of the awkward position in which he is about to find himself by the rapid fall of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7411"/>The reason is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7412"/>Cut off from communication with the <rs>East</rs>, the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> could not long support a large army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7414"/>Because, being already inferior in numbers to the enemy, should we divide our forces, it would not take him long to destroy both fractions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7461"/>The situation at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 53" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> requires that we should attack the enemy at once, or await his attack, or evacuate the place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7462"/>Assuming that we have <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men and the enemy nearly twice that number, protected by intrenchments, I am clearly of opinion that no attack should be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7463"/>Our forces are inferior, and the <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs> proves that with only the advantage of position it was hazardous to contend against his superior strength, and to attack him in his intrenchments now would probably inflict on us and the <rs>Confederacy</rs> a fatal blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7464"/>Neither the number nor instruction of our troops renders them equal to the task.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7465"/>I think we can successfully repel any attack upon our camp by the enemy; but it is manifest no attack is meditated; it will be approached gradually, and will be shelled and bombarded without equal means to respond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7466"/>This will compel us to make sorties against his intrenched positions under most adverse circumstances, or to evacuate the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7467"/>The latter seems to me inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7468"/>If so, the only remaining question is, whether the place should be evacuated before, or after, or during its defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7469"/>After fire is opened, or the place is actively shelled or bombarded, or during such an attack, it will be difficult to evacuate the place in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7470"/>With a large body of men imperfectly disciplined, any idle rumor may spread a panic, and inextricable confusion may follow, so that the retreat may become a rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7471"/>The same objections would apply to any partial or feeble defence of the place and re-attempt to evacuate it in the meanwhile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7472"/>If the defence be not determined or the battle decisive, no useful result would follow, but it would afford <pb id="p.579" n="579"/> an opportunity to our enemies to magnify the facts, give them a pretext to claim a victory and to discourage our friends at home and abroad, and diminish, if not destroy, all chances of foreign intervention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7473"/>Under these circumstances I think the evacuation, if it be determined upon, should be made before the enemy opens fire, and not coupled with a sortie against his intrenchments, or partial battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7474"/>It should be done promptly if at all. Even now the enemy can shell our camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7475"/>It should be done in good order, so as not to discourage our friends or give a pretext for the triumph of our enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7476"/>With the forces at our disposition, with a vast territory behind us, with a patriotic and devoted people to support us, the enemy as he moves southward, away from rivers and railroads, would find insurmountable obstacles in moving columns so heavy that we cannot strike them, and over a country where his mechanical superiority will not avail him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7477"/>If we resolve to evacuate, every hour of delay only serves to augment our difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7478"/>The enemy every day grows stronger on our flanks, and menaces more and more our communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7479"/>If he effects his designs, we must fight at every disadvantage or retreat disastrously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7480"/>History and our country will judge us, not by the movement, but its consequences.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7489"/>The great point is to defend the river at <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 5" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7490"/>The question of who does it must be of a secondary consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7491"/>The troops <pb id="p.580" n="580"/> of your command are there, and I think it but fair that you should direct the operations at that point, and you have my warmest wishes for your success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7492"/>By the copy of <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> order which I ordered to be enclosed to you a few days ago, you will perceive that <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 5" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburg</placeName> is in my department and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0136.0027.00580.08009" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,J.,R.,,:2"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in yours; but I attach only little importance to this matter; all that I desire is success to our arms and to our cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7493"/>With regard to your appeal for small arms, I should be most happy to send them to you if they could be spared from here at this critical moment; but being on the eve of a battle with a powerful enemy, close in my front, it becomes impossible to grant your request, for a defeat here would result in the loss of the whole <placeName reg="Mississippi Valley">Mississippi Valley</placeName>, including your force, and the points you are now holding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7494"/>With regard to the defence of the railroads you refer to, the best way of accomplishing it is to remove the cars and engines and to destroy a few bridges; they could not then be used by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7495"/>As soon, however, as I can return you some arms it shall be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7496"/>I can only express again my regret at not having here the available force at present with you, for I care more about my front at this moment than I do for my rear.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7498"/>General,&mdash;Your letter of the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th instant</day></dateStruct> has just been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7499"/>Although no instructions have been given as to the military operations within your department since its command devolved on you, yet your condition and movements have been the subject of anxious consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7500"/>Full reliance was felt in your judgment and skill and in the bravery of your army, to maintain the great interest of the country, and to advance the general policy of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7501"/>It was also hoped that the victory of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> would have enabled you, Upon the arrival of your reinforcements, to reoccupy the country north of you, and to have re-established the former communications enjoyed by the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7502"/>This hope is still indulged, and every effort will be made, as has heretofore been done, to strengthen you by all the means within the control of the department.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7503"/>Should, however, the superior numbers of the enemy force you back, the line of retreat indicated by you is considered the best, and in that event, should it be inevitable, it is hoped you will be able to strike a successful blow at the enemy if he follows, which will enable you to regain the ascendency and drive him back to the <rs>Ohio</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7504"/>The maintenance of your present position, with the advantages you ascribe to it, so long as you can resist the enemy and subsist your army, is, of course, preferable to withdrawing from it, and thus laying open more of the country to his ravages, unless by skilful manoeuvring you can entice him to a more favorable position to attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7505"/>The question of subsisting your army for any length of time, cut off from the supplies north of you, may demand your serious attention, and was the subject of a telegraphic despatch to you this morning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7506"/>The supplies accumulated at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> are intended as a reserve for the army <pb id="p.581" n="581"/> in the <rs>East</rs> as well as the <rs>West</rs>, and cannot be entirely appropriated to either division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7507"/>Each army must therefore draw its support as far as possible from the country it can control; and this necessity must not be lost sight of in the operations of either, and may accelerate movements which otherwise it might be deemed prudent to restrain.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7648"/>General,&mdash;In relation to recent military operations in this quarter, I have to submit the following for the information of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7649"/>The purposes and ends for which I had occupied and held <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 53" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> having been mainly accomplished by the last of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, and by the <num value="25" type="ordinal">25th</num> of that month having ascertained definitely that the enemy had received large accessions to his already superior force, while ours had been reduced day by day, by disease resulting from bad water and inferior food, I felt it clearly my duty to evacuate that position without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7650"/>I was further induced to this step by the fact that the enemy had declined my offer of battle, twice made him, outside of my intrenched lines, and sedulously avoided the separation of his corps, which he advanced with uncommon caution under cover of heavy guns, strong intrenchments, constructed with unusual labor and with singular delay, considering his strength and our relative inferiority in numbers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7651"/>The transparent object of the <rs>Federal</rs> commander had been to cut off my resources by destroying the <rs>Mobile</rs> and <rs>Ohio</rs> and the <rs>Memphis</rs> and <rs>Charleston</rs> railroads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7652"/>This was substantially foiled by the evacuation and withdrawal along the line of the former road, and, if followed by the enemy remote from his base, I confidently anticipated an opportunity for resumption of the offensive, with chances for signal success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7653"/>Under these plain conditions, on the <dateStruct value="--26"><day reg="26">26th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, I issued verbally several <pb id="p.588" n="588"/> orders, copies of which are herewith, marked A, B, and C, partially modified subsequently, as will be seen by the papers, etc., herewith, marked D, E, F, and G. These orders were executed, I am happy to say, with singular precision, as will be found fully admitted in the correspondence, from the scene, of the <orgName n="Chicago Tribune" type="newspaper">Chicago <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, herewith transmitted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7654"/>At the time finally prescribed the movement commenced, and was accomplished without the knowledge of the enemy, who only began to suspect the evacuation after broad daylight on the morning of <dateStruct value="-05-30"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="30">30th</day></dateStruct>, when, haying opened on our lines from his formidable batteries of heavy and long-range guns, erected the night previous, he received no answer from any direction; but, as our cavalry pickets still maintained their positions of the preceding day, he was not apparently fully satisfied of our movements until some stores, of little value, in the town, were burned, which could not be moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7655"/>It was then, to his surprise, the enemy became satisfied that a large army, approached and invested with such extraordinary preparations, expense, labor, and timidity, had disappeared from his front with all its munitions and heavy guns, leaving him without knowledge, as I am assured, whither it had gone, for his scouts were scattered in all directions, as I have since ascertained, to inquire what directions our forces had taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7656"/>Even now, indeed, I have reason to believe the <rs>Federal</rs> commander has little knowledge of the position and disposition of my main forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7657"/>But for some unfortunate and needless delay on the <orgName n="Memphis and Charleston Railroad" type="railroad">Memphis and Charleston Railroad</orgName> of some <num value="5">five</num> trains of box cars (<num value="3">three</num> miscellaneously freighted and <num value="2">two</num> empty) in passing beyond the bridges over the <placeName key="tgn,7020819" n="1.000 58" reg="hatchie river, united states">Hatchie River</placeName> and its branches, which, in the plan of evacuation, had been directed to be destroyed at a certain hour in the morning of the <dateStruct value="--30"><day reg="30">30th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, not an incident would have marred, in the least, the success of the evacuation in the face of a force so largely superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7658"/>It was, however, through a too rigid execution of orders that these bridges were burned, and we were obliged to destroy the trains as far as practicable and burn the stores, including some valuable subsistence; to what extent will be more precisely reported as soon as practicable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7659"/>The troops moved off in good spirits and order, prepared to give battle if pursued; but no serious pursuit was attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7730"/><hi rend="italics">My dear Sir</hi>,&mdash;It has been a settled policy of my life to allow my acts to speak for themselves, and, so far, I have no cause of complaint at the position, public and private, they have assigned me, and especially has it been my will to avoid discussions in the public press; but it is no departure from that rule to return you my cordial and heartfelt thanks for the sentiments expressed in your article of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> on <q direct="unspecified">Mischief Makers,</q> so far as relates to the positions, personal and official, of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0136.0027.00592.08133" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7731"/>Whoever attempts to disturb those cordial relations will only incur the contempt of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7732"/>No <num value="2">two</num> men living ever served together more harmoniously or parted with more regret, and few men possess my confidence and esteem to the same extent, as a general and a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7733"/>None of us are free from our faults and weaknesses, but among mine will never be found a jealousy which would detract from so pure a man and eminent a general as <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0136.0027.00592.08134" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7734"/>No <num value="1">one</num> could have been more surprised at the order assigning me to his command than myself, and certainly the idea of my being a <q direct="unspecified">pet</q> with any part of the administration is laughable.

Our intercourse was daily, free, unrestrained, and as harmonious as if we had been brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7736"/>Upon the urgent appeal of his physicians, after arriving here, where it was supposed we should not be assailed by the enemy for a few weeks, he retired <pb id="p.593" n="593"/> to seek some relief from the toils which have made him an old man in the short space of <num value="1">one</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7737"/>If it be his friends who have started this discussion, they are doing him great injustice, and, so far as I am concerned, I can only say to them the records here will show with what regret I parted with their chief, and how ardently I hoped for his restoration, that he might resume the position he had filled so honorably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7738"/>I still hope that when his health is restored he may return to this command, for my poor abilities will still be taxed to the fullest extent in rendering him that aid he has ever candidly asked and cordially received.</p>
