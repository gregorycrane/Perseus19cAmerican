<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In private life, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tributes to the loved and the lost, are the best, because they are the tenderest and most sincere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>So, too, is it with a mourning people; and no offering of affection can be held more sacred than that which flows unbidden from the bereaved heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Since the death of the <rs>Father</rs> of the <rs>Republic</rs>, which filled the country with grief, and threw distant nations into mourning, there have been but <num value="3">three</num> funerals in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> which bore even a faint resemblance to that, in the depth and extent of the public sorrow; and these have all occurred within the last few years:&mdash;The <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> was of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0184.0001.00001.00002" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who holds the next place to <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> in the hearts of our people, and who is enshrined among the few beloved names which all mankind cherish:&mdash;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He was fortunate in his ancestry, for they were the best stock of the <num value="2">two</num> Englands&mdash;the <rs>Old</rs> and the <rs>New</rs>&mdash;and that meant the best stock of men on the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Physically, they were tall, broad-shouldered, strong, fine-looking men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We attach a good deal of importance to these facts; for, however common it may be in Democracies, to speak slightingly of noble descent, yet all men of sense are well aware that nothing more valuable can be inherited than good sound blood&mdash;strong, healthy constitutions,&mdash;ample and vigorous frames, well put together,&mdash;unless indeed it may be&mdash;what is so generally allied to all these qualities&mdash;strong, healthy brains, vigorous intellect, and manly character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But, when to all this are joined habits of learning, graces of scholarship, dignified manners, broad intelligence, familiarity with public affairs, the respect of their fellow-men, with high standing in good society, and enough of fortune&mdash;lands and money&mdash;to command all the advantages which a competency of this world's goods can bestow; it would be strange indeed if, from such sources, strong characters should not grow up. It was under such auspices that <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0184.0001.00003.00010" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s boyhood began, and the ripened fruit of all this auspicious planting showed itself throughout his well-rounded life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> colonizing of the country, <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> Bay had planted institutions of learning, and nurtured them with the utmost care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The common schools of the <name>Colony</name> were then the best in the world, those of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> leading the way. At the time <rs>Charles Sumner</rs>'s education began, these common schools had grown to be so excellent, that <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n0184.0001.00004.00011" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> said if he had as many sons as <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Priam</foreName></persName>, he would send them all to the district school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In his <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> year he entered the <name>Public</name> <orgName n="Latin School" type="school">Latin School of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName></orgName>, where he began his preparation for maturer studies, carrying away from all rivals the prizes for <name>English</name> composition and Latin poetry, besides gaining medals for distinction in other departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>His final preparation for college was completed at the <orgName n="Phillips Academy" type="academy">Phillips Academy</orgName>, when he entered the <rs type="place">University</rs>, where a brilliant list of <persName n="Sumners,,,,," id="n0184.0001.00004.00012" reg="mostcommon:Sumners,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumners</surname></persName> on the scrolls, stretched through more than a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Having formed thorough habits of study, he easily surmounted every difficulty that lay in his way, and being graduated with honor in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, he still continued his studies, with the aid of private tutors, for another year, when he entered the <orgName n="Law School" type="school">law school</orgName> at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, under the special encouragement of <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> story, who formed for him a deep attachment, which grew more earnest and genial to the end of that great man's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He predicted for his <hi rend="italics">protege</hi> the earliest and highest success as a jurist, remarking that he had never seen a young man so readily master the profound principles of law. From early boyhood History had for him a special fascination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He loved investigation <hi rend="italics">for it's own</hi> <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> <hi rend="italics">sake</hi> so well, that almost insensibly to himself he became the best historical student of his time; and this alone can account for the endless wealth of illustration he had stored up for future use in public life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Having the <orgName n="Law library" type="library">Law Library</orgName> under his control as its librarian, he could lay his hand instantly upon any volume, and he amazed the ripe jurists around him with the enormous extent and minuteness of his learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He seemed to make an exhaustive study of every subject that came before him. The text-books which filled the scope of study for his associates, were but guides for him to broader and deeper explorations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>During his law studies he wrote several articles for <hi rend="italics">The American Jurist</hi>, of which he subsequently became editor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Being admitted to the <name>Bar</name> in <dateStruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct>, he found himself suddenly launched into a successful and lucrative practice, which even with able men, had been considered the reward only of long years of patient industry and assiduous application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He was soon appointed Reporter of the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In fact, he soon reached so high a standing, that he delivered lectures before the <orgName n="Law School" type="school">Law School</orgName>, in the absence of either <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> story or <persName n="Greenleaf,Professor,,,," id="n0184.0001.00005.00013" reg="mostcommon:Greenleaf,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Greenleaf</surname></persName>; and with so much acceptance that, by the advice of those eminent men, he was invited to the chair of a Professor in the institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But, regarding all he had hitherto done as only preliminary to larger attainments, he unhesitatingly declined the honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The learned <rs>Andrew Dunlap</rs> had before this written <q direct="unspecified">A Treatise on the <name>Practice</name> of the <rs>Courts</rs> of Admiralty in Civil Causes of Maritime Jurisdiction,</q> but was prevented <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> by illness from bringing it out.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The young lawyer had now entered upon a brilliant career, with prospects that would have gratified the ambition of almost any other man. But with a loftier ambition, he threw up his practice, to visit <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, where he could pursue his studies to greater advantage, and carefully survey the structure of society and government in the old world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is not surprising that with his high attainments, and with such letters, he was warmly received by the great men of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and everywhere treated as a companion, and a guest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He was invited to a seat on the bench in every court he entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>There was not a book, <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> manuscript, or authority in a public or private library of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, that was not at his command; everybody was ready to assist him in his more recondite researches; and for a whole Session he was an attentive listener to the debates of Parliament.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He went through <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, with the same objects in view; and being master of that language also, he accumulated vast stores of learning by conversations with the great scientists and statesmen of that nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He afterwards extended his journey to <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, where again his ripe scholarship, in that most beautiful of all modern tongues, multiplied his facilities for acquisition, and enhanced greatly the charms of his visit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But his objects were not limited to the acquisition of mere learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Endowed by nature with a delicate sense of the beautiful, and having an intense relish for society, he often said that it was impossible for him to give to ordinary persons anything like an adequate idea of the exquisite pleasure he experienced in studying Art in the best galleries of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and enjoying the society of its most learned and gifted men and women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>These few years he always looked back upon as the most useful <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> and delightful of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He once said to me that the memory of those days often broke upon his mind like fresh fountains amidst the sterility of years.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>During this period, he commenced to gather whatever objects of art and beauty suited his refined, artistic taste; and it grew into the beautiful collection he finally made, which was a source of so much pleasure to himself and his friends, and imparted a nameless charm to his library-home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>A brief glance at the state of public affairs at the time, will faintly show what significance there was in the choice of the orator, and what important results were to follow his startling utterances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>American slavery was then in the zenith of its fearful <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> and unthreatened reign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It held the whole nation bound hand and foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It dictated every law passed by Congress, and inspired every measure adopted in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It controlled the <name>Press</name> of a free, and exulted in the sanction of the <name>Pulpit</name> of a Christian, nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It was extending its dark shadow over soil then free, and claiming its inhuman jurisdiction over every Northern hearth-stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It unblushingly boasted that it would <num value="1">one</num> day call the slave-roll on <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>&mdash;And why should the menace seem so unmeaning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Had not <persName n="Boston,,,,," id="n0184.0005.00010.00024" reg="mostcommon:Boston,nomatch:0"><surname>Boston</surname></persName> seen <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0184.0005.00010.00025" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, the chief apostle of freedom, dragged through her streets with a halter about his neck, within sight of that column of Liberty, with scarce a protest from her opulent and polite citizens?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Had not the <rs>Governor</rs> and <orgName n="Georgia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Georgia</orgName> set a price upon the head of that prophet of the coming dispensation of freedom; and should not the <rs>Northern Athens</rs> obey the behest of her cotton king?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>African Slavery had become as sacred in the precincts of <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName>, as it was in the slave-den of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, where the sound of the auctioneer's hammer knocking down men, women, and children to the highest bidder, could be heard from the steps of the <rs>Capitol</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>More slave property was owned in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> than in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>&mdash;abolitionist was as odious a name in <address><street n="Beacon Street">Beacon Street</street></address> as it was in the <rs type="place">St. Charles Hotel</rs> in New Orleans&mdash;<emph>slavery had become the law of the great republic</emph>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>How then could <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> regard any word of irreverence towards that all-powerful Institution, as less than a declaration of war <hi rend="italics">&agrave; l'outrance</hi> against the slaveholding States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>And to inflame the indignity, these insulting words had been uttered by <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant and <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> admired of her own long-descended aristocrats!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>What could not be tolerated, even in so plebeian a fanatic as <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0184.0005.00011.00026" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, no longer than a rope could be thrown to a howling mob, rose when coming from the lips of the eloquent and travelled young patrician, the most atrocious blasphemy against <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the <rs>Constitution</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>And yet his great theme was <q direct="unspecified">The True Grandeur of Nations,</q> and the burden of his oration was <hi rend="italics">Peace</hi>,&mdash;an oration which <persName n="Cobden,,,,," id="n0184.0005.00011.00027" reg="mostcommon:Cobden,Richard,,,:1"><surname>Cobden</surname></persName>, the most eloquent advocate of peace in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, pronounced <q direct="unspecified">the noblest contribution ever made by any modern writer to the cause of peace.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>But it gave offence to the magnates of the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig Party</orgName> in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, since it was known that they were fast drifting, body and soul, into the embraces of the slave-power, which was demanding fresh aggressions upon the territory of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, with a view to wrest from her some of her fairest possessions, to be devoted to the demon of human servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0005.00011.00028" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> early foresaw that this would end in a collision with our sister republic, and which, under the dictation of the slave oligarchy, would be attended with outrages and injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The Whigs had been greatly weakened by the death of <persName n="Harrison,,,,," id="n0184.0005.00011.00029" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Harrison</surname></persName>, and the wavering policy, and final defection of <persName n="Tyler,,John,,," id="n0184.0005.00011.00030" reg="default:Tyler,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>; and the <name>Democrats</name>, preparing to regain their lost power, were also ready to bid for the pro-slavery vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Thus both parties would hold up their hands for any measure that would give them votes, no matter how great the demolition of principle.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.6" type="chapter" n="6"> 
<head>Ii.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In this oration, <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0006.00011.00031" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> uttered the memorable declaration which went through the world:&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">In our <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> age, there can be no peace that is not honorable; there can be no war that is not dishonorable.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>We shall give no space here to any part of that oration, since other speeches on the same subject were elicited by subsequent occasions, when his prophecies were fast becoming history, by the anticipations of war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> being turned into the most active hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>But a careful reading of that oration, which marked <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0006.00012.00032" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance before the country as a public man, will satisfy any student of his Speeches, that on this <dateStruct value="1844-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1844</year>,</dateStruct> he gave clear indications of the policy he was to pursue in future life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Nor could a prophet have marked out with greater clearness, than the historian could afterwards, the course <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0006.00012.00033" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> would take in whatever crisis might arise, involving the fortunes of freedom, or of peace, in the coming struggles of parties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Another point should here be observed, for it gave an index to his character which distinguished him ever afterwards from nearly all the prominent men who were to flourish during the approaching times of excitement and trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>We speak of his inflexibility of purpose; his steady persistence in opposing at any and at all hazards, whatever he believed to be morally, socially, or politically wrong,&mdash;his absolute insensibility to opposition or criticism, come from what quarter they might; and the admirable and absolutely unparalleled steadiness with which he pursued the great objects of his life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>He then began to experience, what he had so many occasions to encounter&mdash;the criticisms of his friends, as well as the assaults of his enemies; the <num value="1">one</num> scarcely exceeding in bitterness the cold reproofs, or only halfconcealed <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> satire of the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Without a single exception, no man in our history has had to pass through such ordeals as <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0184.0006.00013.00034" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Whenever a new crisis rose in the country, he was found marching way ahead of the friends who had so reluctantly just come up to the last position he had taken; and thus they were continually falling off from him, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, all the time; and sometimes whole battalions of them together.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>But with the single exception of the <rs>Supplemental Civil Rights Bill</rs>, which caused him almost the only lingering regret he had in dying so soon, he lived to see every public measure he had proposed involving a great principle of liberty, either fully incorporated into the <rs>Amended Constitution</rs>, or fairly expressed in some statute that was never afterwards to be repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>And yet he seldom rose on the floor of the <name>Senate</name> to announce for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time a new step in advance, without finding himself nearly alone; generally without supporters; sometimes without <num value="1">one</num>:&mdash;and all through this protracted struggle for principle, he was not only subject to the violent persecution of the public press, and the desertion of personal friends, but the object of official insults, and even attempts at Senatorial degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Thus in tracing his career, we shall mark these points as we pass by them, only indicating them now in brief, that the reader may bear in mind these strong attributes of <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0006.00013.00035" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s character, to enable him more fully to comprehend how arduous was his warfare, how immovable was his integrity, how sublime was his faith; how he, more than any other man in our history, illustrated what was so well applied to <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n0184.0006.00013.00036" reg="mostcommon:Burke,Edmund,,,:6"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>, that <q direct="unspecified">he never gave up to party what was meant for mankind.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>But he differed widely with <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0007.00014.00038" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, who cast off all allegiance to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, on the ground that it sanctioned slavery; while <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0007.00014.00039" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> was determined to fight the battle inside of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; declaring, in the most unqualified terms, that this sacred instrument was hostile to slavery in all respects &mdash;that it was established in the spirit of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, which he regarded as the charter of perpetual liberty to the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>He insisted that while the <rs>Constitution</rs> did recognize the existence of involuntary servitude, and conceded temporarily certain privileges to slaveholders, yet, that the founders of the <name>Instrument</name> had no belief in the perpetuity of slavery; and, therefore, he considered it to be sound policy to carry on the war against slavery, <hi rend="italics">under the shield of the <rs>Constitution</rs></hi>. Hence he gave to the <name>Party</name> the watch-word which was everywhere inscribed upon their banners, <q direct="unspecified"><emph rend="caps">the repeal of slavery under the constitution and laws of the federal government</emph>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>There is in the <rs>Constitution</rs> no compromise on the subject of slavery of a character not to be reached legally and constitutionally, which is the only way in which I propose to reach it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/><measure n="25years" type="date">Twenty-five years</measure> have passed since these efforts in the cause of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Some of the partakers in them are still spared to us, full of years and honors; but the larger part have been called from the duty <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> of opposing slavery on earth, to His presence, whose service is perfect freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>But the same question which aroused their energies, presents itself to us. Shall we be less faithful than they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Will <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 191" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> oppose a less unbroken front now than then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Has the sensibility to human suffering lost any of the keenness of its edge?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Let us regard the question closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Congress is called upon to sanction the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, which not only supports slavery, but which contains a clause prohibiting the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of the State</orgName> from abolishing slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>In doing this, it will give a fresh stamp of legislative approbation to an unrighteous system; it will assume a new and active responsibility for the system; it will again become a dealer, on a gigantic scale, in human flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Yes, at this moment, when the conscience of mankind is at last aroused to the enormity of holding a fellow-man in bondage; when, throughout the civilized world, a slavedealer is a bye-word and a reproach, we, as a nation, are about to become proprietors of a large population of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Such an act, at this time, is removed from the reach of the palliation often extended to slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Slavery, we are speciously told by those who seek to defend it, is not our original sin. It was entailed upon us, so we are instructed, by our ancestors; and the responsibility is often, with exultation, thrown upon the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Now, without stopping to inquire into the truth of this suggestion, it is sufficient for the present purpose, to know that by welcoming <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> as a slave State <hi rend="italics">we do make slavery our own original sin</hi>. Here is a new case of actual transgression which we cannot cast upon the shoulders of any progenitors, nor upon any mother country, distant in time or place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, at this day, in this vaunted period of light, will be responsible for it; so that it shall be said hereafter, so long as the dismal history of slavery is read, that in the year of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0184.0008.00018.00062" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, a new and deliberate act was passed to confirm and extend it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>By the present movement we propose no measure of change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Our movement is conservative in its character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>It is to preserve the existing supports of freedom; it is to prevent a violation of the vital principles of free institutions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>By the proposed measure, we not only become parties to the acquisition of a large population of slaves, with all the crime of slavery; but we open a new market for the slaves of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <name>Carolinas</name>, <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> and <hi rend="italics">legalize a new slave trade</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>And yet the deadly consequences of this middle passage have been supposed to fall short of those, which are sometimes undergone by the wretched caravans, driven from the exhausted lands of the <rs>Northern</rs> slave States to the sugar plantations nearer to the sun of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>It is supposed, that <num value="1">one</num>-quarter part often perish in these removals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>I see them, in imagination, on this painful passage, chained in bands or troops, and driven like cattle, leaving behind what has become to them a home and a country (alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Can this take place with our consent, nay, without our most determined opposition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>If the slave trade is to receive a new adoption from our country, let us have no part or lot in it. Let us wash our hands of this great guilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>As we read its horrors, may each of us be able to exclaim, with a conscience void of offence, <q direct="unspecified">Thou canst not say I did it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>And who are the <rs>Whigs</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Some may say they are the supporters of the tariff; others, that they are the advocates of internal improvements; of measures to restrain the exercise of the veto power; or of a bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>All these are now, or have been, prominent articles in the faith of the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>But this enumeration does not do justice to the character of the <rs>Whigs</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The Whigs, as their name imports, are, or <hi rend="italics">ought to be</hi>, the party of Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>They seek, or should seek, on all occasions, to carry out fully and practically the principles of our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The principles which our fathers declared, and sealed with their blood, their Whig children should seek to manifest in their acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The Whigs, therefore, reverence the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, as embodying the vital truths of freedom, especially that great truth, <q direct="unspecified">that all men are born equal.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>They reverence the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and seek to guard it against infractions; believing that under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, Freedom can be best preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>They reverence the public faith, and require that it should be punctiliously kept in all laws, charters, and obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>They reverence the principles of morality, of truth, of justice, of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>They seek to advance their country, rather than individuals; and to promote the welfare of the people, rather than of their leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>A member of such an association, founded on the highest moral sentiments, recognizing conscience and benevolence as its animating ideas, cannot be said <q direct="unspecified">to give to party what was meant for mankind;</q> for all the interests of the party must be coincident and commensurate with the manifold interests of humanity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Such is, as I trust, or <hi rend="italics">certainly should be</hi>, the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In doing this, it does not neglect other things; as the tariff, or internal improvements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>But it treats these as subordinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Far less does it show indifference to the <rs>Constitution</rs> or the <rs>Union</rs>; for <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> it seeks to render these the guardians and representatives of the lofty principles to which we are attached.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The Whigs have been called by you, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, the <hi rend="italics">conservatives</hi>. In a just sense, they should be conservatives; not of forms only, but of substance; not of the letter only, but of the living spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The Whigs should be the conservators of the spirit of our ancestors; conservators of the great animating ideas of our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>They should profess that truest and highest <hi rend="italics">conservatism</hi>, which watches, guards, and preserves the great principles of Truth, Right, Freedom, and Humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Such a conservatism is not narrow and exclusive; but broad and expansive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It is not trivial and bigoted; but manly and generous.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>And the question here arises, how shall this party, inspired by these principles, now act?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The answer is easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>In accordance with their principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It must utter them with distinctness, and act upon them with energy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The time, I believe, has gone by when the question is asked, <hi rend="italics">What has the <rs>North</rs> to do with Slavery</hi>? It might almost be answered, that, politically, it had little to do with anything else, so are all the acts of our government connected, directly or indirectly, with this institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Slavery is everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It constitutionally enters the halls of Congress, in the disproportionate representation of the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It follows into the free States, in pursuance of a provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, those fugitives, who, under the inspiration of freedom, seek our altars for safety; nay, more, with profane hands it seizes those who have never known the name of slave, colored freemen of the <rs>North</rs>, and dooms them to irremediable bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It insults and exiles from its jurisdiction the honored representatives of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, who seek, as messengers of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, to secure for her colored citizens the peaceful safeguard of the laws of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It not only uses the <rs>Constitution</rs> for its purposes, but abuses <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> it also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It violates the <rs>Constitution</rs> at pleasure, to build up new slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It seeks perpetually to widen its area, while professing to extend the area of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It has brought upon the country war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, with its enormous expenditures, and more enormous guilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>By the spirit of union among its supporters, it controls the affairs of government; interferes with the cherished interests of the <rs>North</rs>, enforcing and then refusing protection to her manufactures; makes and unmakes presidents; usurps to itself the larger portion of all offices of honor and profit, both in the army and navy, and also in the civil department; and stamps upon our whole country the character, before the world, of that monstrous anomaly and mockery, a <hi rend="italics">slaveholding republic</hi>, with the living truths of freedom on its lips, and the dark mark of slavery printed on its brow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>And shall this Commonwealth continue in any way to sustain an institution which its laws declare to be contrary to natural right, to justice, to humanity and sound policy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Shall the <rs>Whigs</rs> support what is contrary to the fundamental principles of the party?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Here the consciences of good men respond to the judgment of the court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>If it be wrong to hold a single slave, it must be wrong to hold many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>If it be wrong for an individual to hold a slave, it must be wrong for a State.

<p>Certainly, to labor in this cause is far higher and nobler than to strive merely for a <hi rend="italics">repeal of the <name>Tariff</name></hi>, which was once mentioned as the tocsin to rally the <rs>Whigs</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Repeal of Slavery under the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is a more <name>Christian</name> and more potent watchword, because it embodies a higher sentiment, and a more commanding duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The time has passed when this can be opposed on constitutional grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It will not be questioned by any competent authority, that <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> Congress may, by express legislation, abolish slavery, <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, if there should be any; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, that it may abolish the slave trade on the high seas between the <name>States</name>; <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, that it may refuse to admit any new State with a constitution sanctioning slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It is, then, by constitutional legislation, and even by amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that slavery may be reached.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>And here the question arises: Are there any <hi rend="italics">compromises</hi> in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of such a character as to prevent action on this subject?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>I wish to say, distinctly, that there is no compromise on the subject of slavery, of a character not to be reached <hi rend="italics">legally and constitutionally</hi>, which is the only way in which I propose to reach it. Wherever power and jurisdiction are secured to Congress, they may unquestionably be exercised in conformity with the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>And even in matters beyond existing powers and jurisdiction, there is a constitutional method of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The Constitution contains an article pointing out how, at any time, amendments may be made thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>This is an important element, giving to the <rs>Constitution</rs> a <hi rend="italics">progressive</hi> character; and allowing it to be moulded to suit new exigencies and new conditions of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The wise framers of this instrument did not treat the country as a Chinese foot&mdash;never to grow after its infancy&mdash;but anticipated the changes incident to its growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>The unhappy monarch, turning upon his couch, said, <q direct="unspecified">It is an <hi rend="italics">insurrection</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/><q direct="unspecified">No, Sire,</q> was the reply of the honest courtier, <q direct="unspecified">it is a <hi rend="italics">revolution</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>And such is our Movement to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>It is a Revolution&mdash;not beginning <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> with the destruction of a Bastile, but destined to end only with the overthrow of a tyranny, differing little in hardship and audacity from that which sustained the <name>Bastile</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 7" reg="france">France</placeName>&mdash;I mean the <rs>Slave Power</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>By the <rs>Slave Power</rs>, I understand that combination of persons, or, perhaps, of politicians, whose animating principle is the perpetuation and extension of Slavery, and the advancement of Slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>That such a combination exists, will be apparent from a review of our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>It shows itself, in the mildest, and perhaps the least offensive form, in the undue proportion of offices under the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, which has been held by Slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>It is still worse apparent in a succession of acts by which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has been prostituted to the cause of Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Among the most important of these is the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, the <name>Annexation</name> of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, and the <rs>War</rs> with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Mindful of the sanctions, which Slavery derived under the <rs>Constitution</rs>&mdash;from the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>&mdash;of the fraud and iniquity of the <name>Annexation</name> of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>&mdash;and of the great crime of waging an unnecessary and unjust war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>&mdash;of the mothers, wives, and sisters compelled to mourn sons, husbands, and brothers, untimely slain,&mdash;as these things, dark, dismal, atrocious, rise to the mind, may we not brand their author, the <rs>Slave Power</rs>, as a tyranny hardly less hateful than that which sustained the <name>Bastile</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>This combination is unknown to the <rs>Constitution</rs>; nay, it exists in defiance of the spirit of that instrument, and of the recorded opinions of its founders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The Constitution was the crowning labor of the authors of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>It was established to perpetuate, in the form of an organic law, those rights which the <name>Declaration</name> had promulgated, and which the sword of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00046.00161" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:3"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> had secured &mdash;<q direct="unspecified">We hold these truths to be self-evident&mdash;that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights,&mdash;that <hi rend="italics">among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Such are the emphatic words which our country took upon its lips, when it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> claimed its place among the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>These were its baptismal vows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>And the preamble of the <rs>Constitution</rs> renews them, when it declares its objects to be, among other things, <q direct="unspecified">to establish justice, to promote the general welfare, and <hi rend="italics">secure the blessings of liberty</hi> to ourselves and our posterity.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Mark; it is not to establish <hi rend="italics">injustice</hi>&mdash; not to promote the welfare of a class, or of a few slaveholders, but the <hi rend="italics">general</hi> welfare; not to foster the curse of slavery, but to secure the blessings of <hi rend="italics">liberty</hi>. And the declared opinions of the fathers were all <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> in harmony with these instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/><q direct="unspecified">I can only say,</q> said <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00047.00162" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:3"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">that there is not a man living, who wishes more sincerely than I do to see a plan adopted for the abolition of slavery; but there is only <num value="1">one</num> proper and effectual mode by which it can be accomplished, and that is, by the legislative authority; and this, as far as my suffrage will go, shall not be wanting.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/><placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, while confessing that he was a master of slaves, said, <q direct="unspecified">I will not, I cannot justify it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>I believe a time will come, when an opportunity will be offered to abolish this lamentable evil.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>And <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00047.00163" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, as <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the earliest <orgName n="Abolition Society" type="society">Abolition Society</orgName> of the country, signed a petition to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Congress, in which he declared that he <q direct="unspecified">considered himself bound to use all justifiable endeavors to loosen the bands of slavery, and promote a general enjoyment of the blessings of freedom.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Thus the soldier, the orator, and the philosopher of the <name>Revolution</name>, all unite in homage to Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, so wise in counsel and in battle; <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, with his tongue of flame; <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00047.00164" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, with his heaven-descended sagacity and humanity, all bear testimony to the true spirit of the times in which they lived, and of the institutions which they helped to establish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>It is apparent that our constitution was formed by the lovers of Human Freedom; that it was animated by their divine spirit; that the institution of Domestic Slavery was regarded by them with aversion, so that, though covertly alluded to, it was not named in the instrument; and that they all looked forward to the day when this evil and shame would be obliterated from the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Surely, then, it is right to say that the combination, whose object is to perpetuate and extend Slavery, is unknown to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and exists in defiance of the spirit of that instrument, and of the recorded opinions of its founders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Time would fail me to dwell on the growing influence which it has exerted from the foundation of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>In the earlier periods of our history it was moderate and reserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>The spirit of the founders still prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>But with the advance of time, and as these early champions passed from the scene, it became more audacious, aggressive and tyrannical, till at last it has obtained the control of the government, and caused it to be administered, not in the spirit of Freedom, but in the spirit of Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Yes! the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is now (let it be said with shame) not what it was at the beginning, a government merely permitting, while it regretted Slavery, but a <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> government openly favoring and vindicating it, visiting also with its displeasure all who oppose it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It is during late years that the <rs>Slave Power</rs> has introduced a new test for office&mdash;a test which would have excluded <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00048.00165" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00048.00166" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>It applies an arrogant and unrelenting ostracism to all who express themselves against Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>And now, in the madness of its tyranny, it proposes to extend this curse to new soils not darkened by its presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>It seeks to make the flag of our country the carrier of Slavery into distant lands; to scale the mountain fastnesses of <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>, and descend with its prey upon the shores of the <rs>Pacific</rs>; to cross the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, and there, in broad territories, recently obtained by robber hands from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, to plant a shameful institution, which that republic has expressly abolished. * *</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>And now the question occurs, What is the true line of duty with regard to these <num value="2">two</num> candidates?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/><persName n="Buren,Mister,,,,Van" id="n0184.0013.00048.00167" reg="nearbymention:Buren,Martin,,,Van"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName> (and I honor him for his trumpet call to the <rs>North</rs>) has sounded the true note, when he said he could not vote for either of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Though nominated by different parties, they represent, as I have said, substantially the same interest &mdash;the <rs>Slave Power</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>The election of either would be a triumph of the <rs>Slave Power</rs>, and entail upon the country, in all probability, the sin of extending slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>How, then, shall they be encountered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>It seems to me, in a very plain way. The lovers of Freedom, of all parties, and irrespective of all party association, must unite, and, by a new combination, congenial with the <rs>Constitution</rs>, oppose both candidates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>This will be the <name>Freedom</name> power, whose single object shall be to resist the <name>Slave</name> power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>We shall put them face to face, and let them grapple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Who can doubt the result?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>But it is said that we shall throw away our votes, and that our opposition will fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Fail, Sir!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>No honest, earnest effort in a good cause ever fails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>It may not be crowned with the applause of men; it may not seem to touch the goal of immediate worldly success, which is the end and aim of so much of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>But still it is not lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>It helps to strengthen the weak with new virtue; to arm the irresolute with proper energy; to animate all with devotion to duty, which in the end conquers all. Fail!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Did the martyrs fail, when with their precious blood they sowed the seed of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Did the discomfited champions of Freedom fail, who have left those names in history which can never die?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>Did the <num value="300">three hundred</num> Spartans fail, when, in the narrow pass, they did not fear to brave the innumerable Persian hosts, whose very arrows darkened the sun?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>No! Overborne by numbers, crushed to earth, they <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> have left an example which is greater far than any victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>And this is the least we can do. Our example shall be the source of triumph hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>It will not be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in history that the hosts of Slavery have outnumbered the champions of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>But where is it written that Slavery finally prevailed?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>But the assurances received here to-day show that we need not postpone our anticipations of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>It seems already at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>The heart of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> beats responsive to the heart of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and all the <rs>Free States</rs> are animated with the vigorous breath of Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Let us not, then, waste time in vain speculations between the <num value="2">two</num> candidates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Both are bad. Both represent a principle which we cannot sanction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Whatever may be said by politicians to the contrary, the question of Freedom is the only <num value="1">one</num> now before the <rs>American</rs> people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>All other questions being withdrawn, what remains for those who, in casting their votes, regard <hi rend="italics">principles</hi> rather than <hi rend="italics">men</hi>? It is clear, that the only question of any present practical interest is that arising from the usurpations of the <rs>Slave Power</rs>, and the efforts to extend slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>This is the vital question of our country at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>It is <hi rend="italics">the question of questions</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>Something more might have been said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/><hi rend="italics">It is a continuance of the <rs>American Revolution</rs></hi>. It is an effort to carry into effect the principles of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, and to revive in the administration of our government the spirit of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00049.00168" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00049.00169" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>; to bring back the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the principles and practice of its early founders; to the end that it shall promote Freedom and not Slavery, and shall be administered in harmony with the spirit of Freedom, and not with the spirit of Slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>There are emphatic words in the last will and testament of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, which may be adopted as a motto for the present contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>After providing for the emancipation of his slaves, to take place on the death of his wife, he says, <q direct="unspecified">And I do expressly forbid the sale or transportation out of the said Commonwealth, of any slave I may die possessed of <hi rend="italics">under any pretence, whatever</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>So at least should the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> expressly forbid the sale or transportation of any slave beyond their ancient borders, under any pretence whatever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Returning to our forefathers for their principles, let us borrow, also, something of their courage and union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Let us summon to our sides <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> the majestic forms of those civil heroes, whose firmness in council was equalled only by the firmness of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0184.0013.00050.00170" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:3"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> in war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Deriving instruction from our enemies, let us also be taught by the <rs>Slave Power</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> slaveholders are always united in purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Hence their strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Like arrows in a quiver, they cannot be broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The friends of Freedom have thus far been divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/><hi rend="italics">Union</hi>, then, must be our watchword,&mdash;union among men of all parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>By such a union we shall consolidate an opposition which must prevail.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>In the contemplation of these great interests, the intrigues of party, the machinations of politicians, the combinations of office-seekers, seem all to pass from our sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Politics and morals, no longer divorced from each other, become <num value="1">one</num> and inseparable in the holy wedlock of <name>Christian</name> sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Such a union elevates politics, while it gives a new sphere to morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Political discussions have a grandeur which they have never before assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Released from those topics, which concern only the selfish strife for gain, and which are perhaps independent of morals, they come home to the hearts and consciences of men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/></p> 
<p>While recognizing this peculiar enunciation of the <name>Equality</name> of men, as more specific and satisfactory than the naked statement that all men are borne equal, it is impossible not to be reminded that this form of speech finds its prototype in the ancient <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>In the history of <persName n="Herodotus,,,,," id="n0184.0016.00082.00242" reg="mostcommon:Herodotus,nomatch:0"><surname>Herodotus</surname></persName>, we are told that <q direct="unspecified">the government of the many has the most beautiful name of <foreign lang="greek">i&gt;sonomi/a</foreign></q>&mdash;or <hi rend="italics">Equality before the law</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>Such a word in our own language, as a substitute for Equality, might have superseded some of the criticism to which this political doctrine has been exposed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>After this review, the way is now prepared to consider the nature of Equality, as secured by the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>The Constitution of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> repeats the same idea in a different form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>The language here employed, in its natural signification, condemns every form of inequality, in civil and political institutions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>Though these declarations preceded, in point of time, the ampler declarations of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 7" reg="france">France</placeName>, they may, if necessary, be construed in the light of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>Neither strangers, nor the most intimate friends, could discover that his spirits were even ruffled; and to reply to any of the assaults made upon him, however malignant, or the prophecies of evil omen which were so profusely uttered, was the last thing he thought of. Indeed, through life he made it a rule never to reply to attacks, unless it became necessary to fortify by further authorities the facts he had stated, for his faith that truth would finally prevail was never shaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>He never displayed the least anxiety to win conviction from the obstinate or stolid by reiterating arguments or statements already made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>He believed that every truth could take care of itself; that if crushed to earth, it would rise again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>That personal responsibility I accept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>Before the <name>Senate</name> and the country let me be held accountable for this act, and for every word which I utter.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>With me, sir, there is no alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>Painfully convinced of the unutterable wrongs and woes of slavery; profoundly believing that, according to the true spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the sentiments of the fathers, it can find no place under our <hi rend="italics">National</hi> Government&mdash;that it is in every respect <hi rend="italics">sectional</hi>, and in no respect <hi rend="italics">national</hi>&mdash;that it is always and everywhere the creature and dependent of the <hi rend="italics">States</hi>, and never anywhere the creature or dependent of the <hi rend="italics">Nation</hi>, and that the <hi rend="italics">Nation</hi> can never, by legislative or other act, impart to it any support, under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>; with these convictions, I could not allow this session to reach its close, without making or seizing an opportunity to declare myself openly against the usurpation, injustice, and cruelty of the late enactment by Congress for the recovery of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>Full well I know, sir, the difficulties of this discussion, arising from prejudices of opinion and from adverse conclusions, strong and sincere as my own. Full well I know that I am in a small minority, with few here to whom I may look for sympathy or support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>Full well I know that I must utter things unwelcome to many in this body, which I cannot do without pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>Full well I know that the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in our country, which I now proceed to consider, is as sensitive as it is powerful&mdash;possessing a power to shake the whole land with a sensitiveness that shrinks and trembles at the touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>And yet these convictions are now placed under formal ban by politicians of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>The generous sentiments which filled the early patriots, and which impressed upon the <rs>Government</rs> they founded, as upon the coin they circulated, the image and superscription of Liberty, have lost their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>From this <rs n="General Review" type="misc">general review</rs> of the relations of the <rs>National Government</rs> to Slavery, I pass to the consideration of the true Nature of the provision for the surrender of fugitives from service, embracing an examination of this provision in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and especially of the recent act of Congress in pursuance thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>And here, as I begin this discussion, let me bespeak anew your candor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>Not in prejudice, but in the light of history and of reason, let us consider the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>The way will then be easy and the conclusion certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>Much error arises from the exaggerated importance now attached to this provision, and from the assumptions with regard to its origin and primitive character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>It is often asserted that it was suggested by some special difficulty, which had become practically and extensively felt, anterior to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>But this is <num value="1">one</num> of the myths or fables with which the supporters of Slavery have surrounded their false <name n="God" type="God">god</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>In the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, while provision is made for the surrender of fugitive criminals, nothing is said of fugitive slaves or servants; and there is no evidence in any quarter, until after the <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName>, of any hardship or solicitude on this account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>No previous voice was heard to express desire for any provision on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>The story to the contrary is a modern fiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>I put aside as equally fabulous the common saying that this provision was <num value="1">one</num> of the original compromises of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and an essential condition of Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>Though sanctioned by eminent judicial <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> opinions, it will be found that this statement has been hastily made, without any support in the records of the <rs>Convention</rs>, the only authentic evidence of the compromises; nor will it be easy to find any authority for it in any contemporary document, speech, published letter or pamphlet of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>It is true that there were compromises at the formation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which were the subject of anxious debate; but this was not of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>There was a compromise between the small and large States, by which equality was secured to all the <name>States</name> in the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>There was another compromise finally carried, under threats from the <rs>South</rs>, <hi rend="italics">on the motion of a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> member</hi>, by which the <rs>Slave States</rs> were allowed Representatives according to the whole number of free persons, and <q direct="unspecified"><num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of all other persons,</q> thus securing political power on account of their slaves, in consideration that direct taxes should be apportioned in the same way. Direct taxes have been imposed at only <num value="4">four</num> brief intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>The political power has been constant, and, at this moment, sends <num value="21">twenty-one</num> members to the other <orgName n="House" type="government">House</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>There was <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> compromise, which cannot be mentioned without shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>It was that hateful bargain by which Congress was restrained until <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct> from the prohibition of the foreign slave trade, thus securing, down to that period, toleration for crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>This was pertinaciously pressed by the <rs>South</rs>, even to the extent of an absolute restraint on Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>At a subsequent day, Congress branded the slave trade as piracy, and thus, by solemn legislative act, adjudged this compromise to be felonious and wicked.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>It was introduced tardily, at a late period of the <rs>Convention</rs>, and with very little and most casual discussion adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>(I.) <hi rend="italics">Now, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, of the power of Congress over this subject</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>The Constitution contains <hi rend="italics">powers</hi> granted to Congress, <hi rend="italics">compacts</hi> between the <name>States</name>, <hi rend="italics">and prohibitions</hi> addressed to the <name>Nation</name> and to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>A compact or prohibition may be accompanied by a power; but not necessarily, for it is essentially distinct in its nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>And here the single question arises, Whether the <rs>Constitution</rs>, by grant, general or special, confers upon Congress any <hi rend="italics">power</hi> to legislate on the subject of fugitives from service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>The whole legislative power of Congress is derived from <num value="2">two</num> sources; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, from the general grant of power, attached to the long catalogue of powers <q direct="unspecified">to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for the carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or in any department or officer thereof;</q> and secondly, from special grants in other parts of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>As the provision in question does not appear in the catalogue of powers, and does not purport to vest any power in the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or in any department or officer thereof, no power to legislate on this subject can be derived from the general grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>Nor can any such power be derived from any special grant in any other part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; for none such exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/><pb id="p.143" n="143"/> The conclusion must be, that no power is delegated to Congress over the surrender of fugitives from service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>Thus the proceedings of the <rs>Convention</rs> show that the founders understood the necessity of <hi rend="italics">powers</hi> in certain cases, and, on consideration, most jealously granted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>A closing example will strengthen the argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>Congress is expressly empowered <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">to establish an uniform rule of</hi> Naturalization, and <hi rend="italics">uniform laws</hi> on the subject of Bankruptcies, <hi rend="italics">throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>Without this provision, these <num value="2">two</num> subjects would have been within the control of the <name>States</name>, and the <name>Nation</name> would have had no power <hi rend="italics">to establish an uniform rule</hi> thereupon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Now, instead of the existing compact on fugitives from service, it would have been easy, had any such desire prevailed, to add this case to the clause on Naturalization and Bankruptcies, and to empower Congress to establish an Uniform rule for the surrender of fugitives from service throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>Then, of course, whenever Congress undertook to exercise the power, all State control of the subject would have been superseded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>The National Government would have been constituted, like <persName><foreName>Nimrod</foreName></persName>, the mighty <rs>Hunter</rs>, with power to gather the huntsmen, to halloo the pack, and to direct the chase of men, ranging at will, without regard to boundaries or jurisdictions, throughout all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>But no person in the <rs>Convention</rs>, not <num value="1">one</num> of the reckless partisans of slavery, was so audacious as to make this proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>Had it been distinctly made, it would have been distinctly denied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>The fact that the provision on this subject was adopted unanimously, while showing the little importance attached to it <hi rend="italics">in the shape it finally assumed</hi>, testifies also that it could not have been regarded <hi rend="italics">as a source of National power over Slavery</hi>. It will be remembered, that, among the members of the <rs>Convention</rs>, were <persName n="Morris,,Gouverneur,,," id="n0184.0039.00143.00423" reg="default:Morris,Gouverneur,,,"><foreName>Gouverneur</foreName> <surname>Morris</surname></persName>, who had said that he <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">never</hi> would concur in upholding domestic slavery;</q> <persName n="Gerry,,Elbridge,,," id="n0184.0039.00143.00424" reg="default:Gerry,Elbridge,,,"><foreName>Elbridge</foreName> <surname>Gerry</surname></persName>, who thought <q direct="unspecified">we ought to be careful not <hi rend="italics">to give any sanction to it;</hi></q> <persName n="Sherman,,Roger,,," id="n0184.0039.00143.00425" reg="default:Sherman,Roger,,,"><foreName>Roger</foreName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who was opposed to any clause <q direct="unspecified">acknowledging men to be property;</q> <persName n="Madison,,James,,," id="n0184.0039.00143.00426" reg="default:Madison,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>, who <q direct="unspecified">thought it wrong to admit in the <rs>Constitution</rs> the idea that there could be property in man;</q> and <persName n="Franklin,,Benjamin,,," id="n0184.0039.00143.00427" reg="default:Franklin,Benjamin,,,"><foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, who likened American slaveholders to <placeName key="tgn,2129174" n="1.000 10" reg="Algerine, Tuolumne, California">Algerine</placeName> corsairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>In the face of these unequivocal statements, it is absurd to suppose that they consented <hi rend="italics">unanimously</hi> to any provision by which the <rs>National Government</rs>, the work of their hands, dedicated to Freedom, could be made the most offensive instrument of Slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>Thus much for the evidence from the history of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/><pb id="p.144" n="144"/> But the <hi rend="italics">true principles of our Political System</hi> are in harmony with this conclusion of history; and here let me say a word of State Rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>It was the purpose of our fathers to create a National Government, and to endow it with adequate powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>They had known the perils of imbecility, discord and confusion, during the uncertain days of the <name>Confederation</name>, and desired a Government which should be a true bond of Union and an efficient organ of the national interests at home and abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>But while fashioning this agency, they fully recognized the <name>Governments</name> of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>To the nation were delegated high powers, essential to the national interests, but specific in character and limited in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>To the <name>States</name> and to the people were reserved the powers, general in character and unlimited in number, not delegated to the <name>Nation</name> or prohibited to the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>And here I end this branch of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>The true principles of our Political System, the history of the <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName>, the natural interpretation of the <rs>Convention</rs>, all teach that this Act is a usurpation by Congress of powers that do not belong to it, and an infraction of rights secured to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>It is a sword, whose handle is at the <rs>National Capital</rs>, and whose point is everywhere in the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>(<num value="2">2</num>.) <hi rend="italics">And now of the denial of Trial by Jury</hi>. Admitting, for the moment, that Congress is entrusted with power over this subject, which truth disowns, still the <name>Act</name> is again radically unconstitutional from its denial of Trial by Jury in a question of Personal Liberty and a suit at common law. Since on the <num value="1">one</num> side there is a claim of property, and on the other of liberty, both property and liberty are involved in the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>To this claim on either side is attached Trial by Jury.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>To me, sir, regarding this matter in the light of the common law and in the blaze of free institutions, it has always seemed impossible to arrive at any other conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>If the language of the <rs>Constitution</rs> were open to doubt, which it is not, still all the presumptions of law, all the leanings for Freedom, all the suggestions of justice, plead angel-tongued for this right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>Nobody doubts that Congress, if it legislates on this matter, <hi rend="italics">may</hi> allow a Trial by Jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>But if it <hi rend="italics">may</hi>, so overwhelming is the claim of justice, it must.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>Beyond this, however, the question is determined by the precise letter of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/><pb id="p.145" n="145"/></p> 
<p>Several expressions in the provision for the surrender of fugitives from service, show the essential character of the proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>In the first place, the person must be, not merely <hi rend="italics">charged</hi>, as in the case of fugitives from justice, but actually <hi rend="italics">held to service</hi> in the <rs>State</rs> from which he escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>In the second place, he must be <q direct="unspecified">delivered up on claim of the party to whom such labor is <hi rend="italics">due</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>These <num value="2">two</num> facts, that he was <hi rend="italics">held</hi> to service, and that his service was <hi rend="italics">due</hi> to his claimant, are directly placed in issue, and must be proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/><num value="2">Two</num> necessary incidents of the delivery may also be observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, it must be made in the <rs>State</rs> where the fugitive is found; and, secondly, it restores to the claimant his complete control over the person of the fugitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>From these circumstances it is evident that the proceedings cannot be regarded, in any just sense, as preliminary, or ancillary to some future formal trial, but as complete in themselves, final and conclusive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>And these proceedings determine on the <num value="1">one</num> side the question of property, and on the other the sacred question of Personal Liberty in its most transcendent form; not merely Liberty for a day or a year, but for life, and the <rs>Liberty</rs> of generations that shall come after, so long as Slavery endures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>To these questions, the <rs>Constitution</rs>, by <num value="2">two</num> specific provisions, attaches the <rs>Trial</rs> by Jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/><num value="1">One</num> of these is the familiar clause, already adduced: <q direct="unspecified">No <hi rend="italics">person</hi> shall be deprived of life, <hi rend="italics">liberty</hi> or property, <hi rend="italics">without due process of law;</hi></q> that is, without due proceedings at law, with Trial by Jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>Not stopping to dwell on this, I press at once to the other provision, which is still more express: <q direct="unspecified">In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure>, the right of Trial by Jury shall be preserved.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>This clause, which was not in the original Constitution when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adopted, was suggested by the very spirit of Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>It is said by <persName n="Burke,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0040.00147.00437" reg="nearbymention:Burke,Edmund,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Burke</surname></persName>, in his magnificent speech on Conciliation with <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, that <q direct="unspecified">nearly as many of <placeName reg="Blackstone, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049422">Blackstone</placeName>'s Commentaries were sold in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> as in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,</q> carrying thither the knowledge of those vital principles of Freedom, which were the boast of the <orgName n="British Constitution" type="newspaper">British Constitution</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>Imbued by these, the earliest <orgName n="Continental Congress" type="congress">Continental Congress</orgName>, in <dateStruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></dateStruct>, declared, <q direct="unspecified">That the respective Colonies are entitled to the common law of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage according to the course of that law.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>Thus, amidst the troubles which heralded the <name>Revolution</name>, the common law was claimed by our fathers as a birthright.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>Now, on principle and authority, <hi rend="italics">a claim for the delivery of a fugitive slave is a suit at common law</hi>, and is embraced naturally and necessarily in this class of judicial proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>This proposition can be placed beyond question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>And here, especially, let me ask the attention of all learned in the law. On this point, as on every other in this argument, I challenge inquiry and answer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>History painfully records, that during the early days of the common law, and down even to a late period, a system of slavery existed in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, known under the name of <hi rend="italics">villanage</hi>. The slave was generally called a <hi rend="italics">villain</hi>, though in the original Latin forms of judicial proceedings, he was termed <hi rend="italics">nativus</hi>, implying slavery by birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>The incidents of this condition have been minutely described, and also the mutual remedies of master and slave, all of which were regulated by the common law. Slaves sometimes then, as now, <hi rend="italics">escaped</hi> from their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>The claim for them after such <hi rend="italics">escape</hi> was prosecuted by a <q direct="unspecified">a suit at common law,</q> to which, as to every suit at common law, the <rs>Trial</rs> by Jury was necessarily attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/><persName n="Blackstone,,,,," id="n0184.0040.00147.00438" reg="mostcommon:Blackstone,nomatch:0"><surname>Blackstone</surname></persName>, in his Commentaries (<ref n="volume 2" targOrder="U">Vol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/><num value="2">II</num></ref>. <ref n="page 93">p. 93</ref>), in words which must have been known to all the lawyers of the <rs>Convention</rs>, said of <hi rend="italics">villains</hi>: <q direct="unspecified">They could not leave their lord without his permission, but <hi rend="italics">if they ran away</hi>, or were purloined from him, <hi rend="italics">might be</hi> claimed <hi rend="italics">and recovered by</hi> action, <hi rend="italics">like beasts or other cattle</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>This very word <q direct="unspecified">action</q> of itself implies <q direct="unspecified">a suit at common law,</q> with Trial by Jury.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>By these various proceedings, all ending in Trial by Jury, Personal Liberty was guarded, even in the early, unrefined, and barbarous days of the common law. Any person claimed as a fugitive slave night invoke this Trial as a sacred right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>Whether the master proceeded by <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> seizure, as he might, or by legal process, the <rs>Trial</rs> by Jury in a suit at common law, before <num value="1">one</num> of the high courts of the realm, was equally secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>In the case of seizure, the fugitive, reserving the proceedings, might institute process against his master and appeal to a court and jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>In the case of process by the master, the watchful law secured to the fugitive the same protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>By no urgency of force, by no device of process, could any person claimed as a slave be defrauded of this Trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>Such was the common law. If its early boast, that there could be no slaves in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, fails to be true, this at least may be its price, that, according to its indisputable principles, the <rs>Liberty</rs> of every man was placed under the guard of Trial by Jury.</p></quote></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>And now, sir, let us review the field over which we have passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>We have seen that any compromise, finally closing the discussion of Slavery under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is tyrannical, absurd, and impotent; that as Slavery can exist only by virtue of positive law, and as it has no such positive support in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, it cannot exist within the <rs>National</rs> jurisdiction; that the <rs>Constitution</rs> nowhere recognizes property in man, and that, according to its true interpretation, Freedom and not Slavery is national, while Slavery and not Freedom is sectional; that, in this spirit, the <rs>National Government</rs> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organized under <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0184.0044.00157.00461" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, himself an Abolitionist, surrounded by Abolitionists, while the whole country, by its Church, its Colleges, its Literature, and all its best voices, was united against Slavery, and the national flag at that time nowhere within the <rs type="place">National Territory</rs> covered a single slave; still further, that the <rs>National Government</rs> is a Government of delegated powers, and as among these there is no power to support Slavery, this institution cannot be national, nor can Congress in any way legislate in its behalf; and, finally, that the establishment of this principle is the true way of peace and safety for the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>Considering next the provision for the surrender of fugitives from service, we have seen that it was not <num value="1">one</num> of the original compromises of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; that it was introduced tardily and with hesitation, and adopted with little discussion, and then and for a long period after was regarded with comparative indifference; that the recent Slave Act, though many times unconstitutional, is especially so on <num value="2">two</num> grounds-<hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi>, as a usurpation by Congress of powers not granted by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> and an infraction of rights secured to the <name>States</name>; and <hi rend="italics">secondly</hi>, as a denial of Trial by Jury, in a question of Personal Liberty and a suit at common law; that its glaring unconstitutionality finds a prototype in the <rs>British</rs> <name n="Stamp Act" type="legislation">Stamp Act</name>, which our fathers refused to obey as unconstitutional on <num value="2">two</num> parallel grounds&mdash;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because it was a usurpation by Parliament of powers not belonging to it under the <orgName n="British Constitution" type="newspaper">British Constitution</orgName>, and an infraction of rights belonging to the <name>Colonies</name>; and <hi rend="italics">secondly</hi>, because it was a denial of Trial by Jury in certain cases of property; that as Liberty is far above property, so is the outrage perpetrated by the <orgName n="American Congress" type="congress">American Congress</orgName> far above that perpetrated by the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName>; and, finally, that the <rs>Slave Act</rs> has not that support in the public sentiment of the <name>States</name> where it is to be executed, which is the life of all law, and which prudence and the precept of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> require.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>Briefly, the <name>States</name> are prohibited from any <q direct="unspecified">law or regulation</q> by which any <q direct="unspecified">person</q> escaped from <q direct="unspecified">service or labor</q> may be discharged therefrom, and on establishment of the claim to such <q direct="unspecified">service or labor,</q> he is to be <q direct="unspecified">delivered up.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>But the mode by which the claim is to be tried and determined is not specified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>All this is obviously within the control of each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>It may be done by virtue of express legislation, in which event any Legislature, justly careful of Personal Liberty, would surround the fugitive with every shield of the law and Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>But here a fact, pregnant with Freedom, must be studiously observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>The name Slave&mdash;that litany of wrong and woe&mdash;does not appear in the clause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>Here is no unambiguous phrase, incapable of a double sense; no <q direct="unspecified">positive</q> language, applicable only to slaves, and excluding all other classes; no word of that absolute certainty in every particular, which forbids any interpretation except that of Slavery, and makes it impossible <q direct="unspecified">to catch at anything in favor of Liberty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>Nothing of this kind is here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>But passing from this; <q direct="unspecified">cruelly and impiously</q> renouncing for the moment all leanings for Freedom; refusing <q direct="unspecified">to catch at anything in favor of Liberty;</q> abandoning the cherished idea of the <name>Fathers</name>, that <q direct="unspecified">It was <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi> to admit in the <rs>Constitution</rs> the idea of property in man;</q> and, in the face of these commanding principles, assuming <num value="2">two</num> things, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that, in the evasive language of this clause, the <rs>Convention</rs>, whatever may have been the aim of individual members, really intended fugitive slaves, which is sometimes questioned; and, secondly, that, if they so intended, the language employed can be judicially regarded as justly applicable to fugitive slaves, which is often and earnestly denied; then the whole proceeding, without any express <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> legislation, may be left to the ancient and authentic forms of the common law, familiar to the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and ample for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>If the fugitive be seized without process, he will be entitled at once to his writ <hi rend="italics">de Homine Replegiando</hi>, while the master, resorting to process, may find his remedy in the writ <hi rend="italics">de Native Habendo</hi>&mdash;each writ requiring Trial by Jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/><pb id="p.168" n="168"/></p> 
<p>Against Freedom both the old parties are now banded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>Opposed to each other in the contest for power, they concur in opposing every effort for the establishment of Freedom under the <rs>National Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>Divided as parties, <hi rend="italics">they are <num value="1">one</num></hi> as supporters of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>On this question we can have no sympathy with either; but must necessarily be against both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>They sustain slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>; we are against it. They sustain the coastwise slave trade under the <rs>National Flag</rs>; we abhor it. They sustain the policy of silence on Slavery in the territories; we urge the voice of positive prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>They sustain that paragon of legislative monsters&mdash;unconstitutional, un-unchristian and infamous&mdash;the <rs>Fugitive Slave Bill</rs>; we insist on its repeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>They concede to the <rs>Slave Power</rs> new life and protection; we cannot be content except with its total destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>Such, fellowciti-zens, is the difference between us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>And now, if here in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, there be any persons, who, on grounds of policy or conscience, feel impelled to support slavery, let them go and sink in the embrace of the old parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>There they belong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>But, on the other hand, all who are sincerely opposed to slavery &mdash;who desire to act against it&mdash;who seek to bear their testimony for Freedom,&mdash;who long to carry into public affairs those principles of morality and <name>Christian</name> duty which are the rule of private life,&mdash;let them come out from both the old parties, and join us. In our <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> party, with the declared friends of Freedom, they will find a place in harmony with their aspirations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>But there is <num value="1">one</num> apology, which is common to the supporters of both the old parties, and which is often in their mouths when pressed for their inconsistent persistence in adhering to these parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>It is dogmatically asserted that there can be but <num value="2">two</num> parties; that <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> party is impossible, particularly in our country, and that, therefore, all persons, however opposed to Slavery, must be content in <num value="1">one</num> of the old parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>This assumption, which is without any foundation in reason, has been so often put forth, that it has acquired a certain currency; and many, who reason hastily, or who implicitly follow others, have adopted it as the all-sufficient excuse for their conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>Confessing their own opposition to slavery, they yet yield to the domination of party, and become dumb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>All this is wrong morally, and, therefore, must be wrong practically.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>Party, in its true estate, is the natural expression and agency of different forms of opinion on important public questions; and itself assumes different forms precisely according to the prevalence of different <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>Thus in the early <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName> republics there were for a while the factions of the <name>Guelphs</name> and Ghibellins, supporters of the <rs>Pope</rs> and the <rs>Emperor</rs>; also of the <name>Whites</name> and the <name>Blacks</name>, taking their names from the color of their respective badges, and in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> factions of the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs> roses, in which was involved the succession to the crown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>But in all these cases the party came into being, died out, or changed with the prevailing sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>If there be in a community only <num value="2">two</num> chief antagonist opinions, then there will be but <num value="2">two</num> parties, embodying these opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>But as other opinions practically prevail and seek vent, so must parties change or multiply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>This is so strongly the conclusion of reason and philosophy, that it could not be doubted, even if there were no examples of such change and multiplication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>But we need only turn to the recent history of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> countries where opinion has had the freest scope to find such examples.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>Thus, for instance, in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 7" reg="france">France</placeName>&mdash;and I dwell on this point because I have observed myself, in conversation, that it is of practical importance &mdash;under <persName n="Philippe,,Louis,,," id="n0184.0049.00169.00483" reg="default:Philippe,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Philippe</surname></persName>, anterior to the late Republic, there was the party of Legitimists, supporters of the old branch of Bourbons; the party of Orleanists, supporters of the existing throne; these <num value="2">two</num> corresponding at the time in relative rank and power to our Whigs and Democrats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2375"/>But besides these, there was <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> party, <hi rend="italics">the small band of republicans, represented in the legislature by a few persons only</hi>, but strong in principles and purposes, which in <dateStruct value="1848-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>, prevailed over both the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2376"/>On the establishment of the <rs>Republic</rs> the multiplicity of parties continued until, with the freedom of opinion and the freedom of the press, all were equally overthrown by <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n0184.0049.00169.00484" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and their place supplied by the enforced unity of despotism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the most important measure of recent reform, the abolition of the laws imposing a protective duty on corn, was carried only by <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>Neither of the <num value="2">two</num> old parties could be brought to adopt this measure and press it to a consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>A powerful public opinion, thus thwarted in the regular channel, found an outlet in another party, which was neither Whig nor Tory, but which was formed from both these parties, and wherein <persName n="Peel,Sir,Robert,,," id="n0184.0049.00169.00485" reg="default:Peel,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Peel</surname></persName>, the great Conservative leader, took his place, side by side, in honorable coalition, with <persName n="Cobden,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0049.00169.00486" reg="mostcommon:Cobden,Richard,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cobden</surname></persName>, the great Liberal leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>In this way the <rs>Corn Laws</rs> were finally overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>The multiplicity of parties in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, engendered by this contest, still continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>At the general election for the new Parliament which has just taken place, the strict lines of <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> ancient parties seemed to be effaced, and many were returned, not as Whigs and Tories, but as Protectionists and anti-Protectionists.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2383"/>Thus, by example in our own day we may confirm the principle of political philosophy, that parties must naturally adapt themselves in character and number to the prevailing public opinion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>Now at the present time in our country, there exists a deep controlling conscientious feeling against Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>You and I, sir, and all of us confess it. While recognizing the <rs>Constitution</rs>, we desire to do everything in our power to relieve ourselves of responsibility for this terrible wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>We would vindicate the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>National Government</rs> which it has established, from all participation in this outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>Both the old political parties, forgetful of the sentiments of the <name>Fathers</name> and of the spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, not only refuse to be in any degree the agents or representatives of our convictions, but expressly discourage and denounce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>Thus baffled in their efforts for utterance, these convictions naturally seek expression in a new agency, the party of Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>Such is the party, which, representing the great doctrines of <persName n="Rights,,Human,,," id="n0184.0049.00170.00487" reg="default:Rights,Human,,,"><foreName>Human</foreName> <surname>Rights</surname></persName>, as enunciated in our <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, and inspired truly by the <rs>Democratic</rs> sentiment, is now assembled here under the name of the <rs>Free Democracy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>The rising public opinion against Slavery cannot now flow in the old political channels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>It is strangled, clogged, and dammed back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>But if not <hi rend="italics">through</hi> the old parties, then <hi rend="italics">over</hi> the old parties, this irresistible current <hi rend="italics">shall</hi> find its way. It cannot be permanently stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>If the old parties will not become its organ, they must become its victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>The party of Freedom will certainly prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>It may be by entering into, and possessing <num value="1">one</num> of the old parties, filling it with our own strong life; or it may be by drawing from both to itself the good and true who are unwilling to continue members of any political combination when it ceases to represent their convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>But, in <num value="1">one</num> way or the other, its ultimate triumph is sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>Of this let no man doubt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>At this moment we are in a minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>At the last popular election in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, there were <num value="28000">twenty-eight thousand</num> Free-Soilers, <num value="43000">forty-three thousand</num> Democrats, and <num value="64000">sixty-four thousand</num> Whigs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>But this is no reason for discouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>According to recent estimates, the population of the whole world amounts to about <num value="800000000">eight hundred millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>Of these only <num value="260000000">two hundred and sixty millions</num> are Christians, while the remaining <num value="540000000">five hundred and forty millions</num> are mainly Mahometans, Brahmins and Idolaters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>Because the <name>Christians</name> are in this minority, that is no reason for renouncing Christianity and for surrendering to the false <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> religions; nor do we doubt that Christianity will yet prevail over the whole earth, as the waters cover the sea. The friends of Freedom in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> are likewise in a minority; but they will not, therefore, renounce Freedom, nor surrender to the political <rs>Mahometans</rs> and idolaters of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>; nor can they doubt that their cause, like Christianity, will yet prevail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>Our cause commends itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>But it is also commended by our candidates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>In all that makes the eminent civilian or the accomplished statesman fit for the responsibilities of government, they will proudly compare with any of their competitors, while they are dear to our hearts as able, well-tried, loyal supporters of those vital principles of Freedom which we seek to establish under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>His genial and sun-like nature irradiates the antagonism of political controversy, while his active and practical mind, richly stored with various experience, never fails to render good service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>To vote for such men will itself be a pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>But it will be doubly so when we reflect that in this way we bear our testimony to a noble cause, with which the happiness, welfare and fame of our country are indissolubly connected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>With such a cause and such candidates, let no man be disheartened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>To carry through this review, under its different heads, I shall not hesitate to meet the objections which have been urged against it, so far at least as I am aware of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>And now, as I speak to you seriously, I venture to ask your serious attention even to the end. Not easily can a public address reach that highest completeness which is found in mingling the useful and the agreeable; but I desire to say, that, in this arrangement and co-ordination of my remarks to-night, I seek to cultivate that highest courtesy of a speaker, which is found in clearness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>I. I begin with the necessity of the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>In the wrong of Slavery, <hi rend="italics">as defined by existing law</hi>, this necessity is plainly apparent; nor can any man within the sound of my voice, who listens to the authentic words of the law, hesitate in my conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2456"/>A wrong so grievous and unquestionable should not be allowed to continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2457"/>For the honor of human nature, and for the good of all concerned, <hi rend="italics">it should at once cease to exist</hi>. On this simple statement, as a cornerstone, I found the necessity of the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>I do not dwell, sir, on the many tales which come from the house of bondage; on the bitter sorrows there undergone; on the flesh, galled by the manacle or spirting blood beneath the lash; on the human form mutilated by the knife, or seared by red-hot iron; on the ferocious scent of blood-hounds in chase of human prey; on the sale of fathers <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> and mothers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, little children&mdash;even infants&mdash;at the auction-block; on the practical prostration of all rights, all ties, and even all hope; on the deadly injury to morals, substituting concubinage for marriage, and changing the whole land of Slavery into a by-word of shame, only fitly pictured by the language of <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0184.0051.00175.00500" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName> when he called his own degraded country a House of Ill-Fame; and last of all, on the pernicious influence upon the master as well as the slave, showing itself too often, even by his own confession, in rudeness of manners and character, and especially in that blindness which renders him insensible to the wrongs he upholds, while he, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2460"/>But all these I put aside; not because I do not regard them of moment in exhibiting the true character of Slavery, but because I desire to present this argument on grounds above all controversy, impeachment, or suspicion, even from slave-masters themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>Not on triumphant story, not even on indisputable facts, do I now accuse Slavery, but on its character, as revealed in its own simple definition of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>As out of its small egg crawls forth the slimy, scaly, reptile crocodile, so out of this simple definition crawls forth the whole slimy, scaly, reptile monstrosity, by which a man is changed into a chattel,&mdash;a person is converted into a thing,&mdash;a soul is transmuted into merchandise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>According to this very definition, the slave is held simply for the good of his master, to whose behests, his life, liberty and happiness are devoted, and by whom he may be bartered, leased, mortgaged, bequeathed, invoiced, shipped as cargo, stored as goods, sold on execution, knocked off at public auction, and even staked at the gaming-table on the hazard of a card or die. The slave may seem to have a wife; but he has not; for his wife belongs to his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/>He may seem to have a child; but he has not; for his child belongs to his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>He may be filled with the desire of knowledge, opening to him the gates of hope on earth and in heaven; but the master may impiously close this sacred pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>Thus is he robbed not merely of privileges, but of himself; not merely of money and labor, but of wife and children; not merely of time and opportunity, but of every assurance of happiness; not merely of earthly hope, but of all those divine aspirations that spring from the <name>Fountain</name> of Light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>He is not merely restrained in liberty, but totally deprived of it; not merely curtailed in rights, but absolutely stripped of them; not merely loaded with burdens, but changed into a beast of burden; not merely bent in countenance to the earth, but sunk to the legal level of a quadruped; not merely exposed to personal cruelty, but deprived of his character as a person; not merely compelled to involuntary labor, but degraded to be a rude thing; not merely shut out from knowledge, but wrested from his place in the human family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/><hi rend="italics">And all this, sir, is according to the simple law of Slavery</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>Nor is even this all. The law, by cumulative provisions, positively forbids that a slave shall be taught to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/>Hear this, fellow-citizens, and confess, that no barbarism of despotism, no extravagance of tyranny, no excess of impiety can be more blasphemous or deadly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/><q direct="unspecified">Train up a child in the way he should go,</q> is the lesson of sacred wisdom; but the law of Slavery boldly prohibits any such training, and dooms the child to hopeless ignorance and degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2484"/></p> 
<p>But it is earnestly averred that slave-masters are humane, and that slaves are treated with kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>These averments, however, I properly put aside, precisely as I have already put aside the multitudinous illustrations from the cruelty of Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>On the simple <hi rend="italics">letter of the law</hi> I take my stand, and do not go beyond what is there nominated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>The masses of men are not better than their laws, and, whatever may be the eminence of individual virtue, it is not reasonable to infer that the masses of slave-masters are better than the law of Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>And, since this law submits the slave to their irresponsible control, with power to bind and to scourge&mdash;to shut the soul from knowledge&mdash;to separate families&mdash;to unclasp the infant from a mother's breast, and the wife from a husband's arms,&mdash;it is natural to conclude that such enormities are sanctioned by them, while the brutal prohibition of instruction&mdash;by supplementary law&mdash;gives crowning evidence of their complete complicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>And this conclusion must exist unquestioned just so long as the law exists unrepealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>Cease, then, to blazon the humanity of slave-masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>Tell me not of the lenity with which this cruel law is tempered to its unhappy subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>Tell me not of the sympathy which overflows from the mansion of the master to the cabin of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>In vain you assert these instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>In vain you show that there are individuals who do not exert the wickedness of the law. The law still endures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>Slavery, which it defines and upholds, continues to outrage Public Opinion, and, within the limits of our Republic, upwards of <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of human beings, guilty only of a skin not colored like your own, are left the victims of its unrighteous, irresponsible power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>Power divorced from right is devilish; power without the check of responsibility is tyrannical; and I need not go back to the authority of <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0184.0051.00177.00504" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName>, when I assert that the most complete injustice is that which is erected into the form of law. But all these things concur in Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>It is, then, on the testimony of slave-masters, solemnly, legislatively, judicially attested in the very law itself, that I now arraign this institution as an outrage upon man and his Creator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>And here is the necessity of the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>A wrong so transcendent, so loathsome, so direful, must be encountered <hi rend="italics">wherever it can be reached</hi>, and the battle must be continued without truce or compromise, until the field is entirely won.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>All other objections are of an inferior character, or are directed logically at its <hi rend="italics">practicability</hi>. Of these <num value="2">two</num> leading objections, let me briefly speak.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>Its importance is apparent in the obvious fact, that, unless such distinction be clearly and unmistakably established, every argument by which our own freedom is vindicated,&mdash;every applause awarded to the successful rebellion of our fathers,&mdash;every indignant word ever hurled against the enslavement of our white fellow-citizens by <placeName key="tgn,2129174" n="1.000 10" reg="Algerine, Tuolumne, California">Algerine</placeName> corsairs, must plead trumpet-tongued against the deep damnation of Slavery, whether <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>Such is the favorite argument often put forth at the <rs>South</rs>, and more than once directly addressed to myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>But I am patient, and see clearly how vain will be his effort, when I call to mind, that, within this very century, other divines sought to throw the same seamless garment over the more shocking slave-trade; and that, among many publications, a little book was then put forth with the name of a reverend clergyman on the title-page, to prove that <q direct="unspecified">the <name>African</name> trade for negro slaves is consistent with the principles of humanity and revealed religion;</q> and, thinking of these things, I am ready to say with <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0184.0051.00180.00513" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>I am now brought, in the <hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num></hi> place, to consider the <name>Practicability</name> of the <rs>Enterprise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>And here the way is easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>In showing its necessity, I have already demonstrated its practicability; for the former includes the latter, as the greater includes the less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>Whatever is necessary, must be practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/>By a decree which has ever been a by-word of tyranny, the <name>Israelites</name> were compelled to make bricks without straw; but it is not according to the ways of a benevolent <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> that man should be constrained to do what cannot be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>Besides, the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs> is right; and the right is always practicable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>I know well the little faith which the world has in the triumph of principles, and I readily imagine the despair with which our object is regarded; but not on this account am I disheartened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>That exuberant writer, <persName n="Browne,Sir,Thomas,,," id="n0184.0052.00181.00514" reg="default:Browne,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Browne</surname></persName>, breaks into an ecstatic wish for some new difficulty in <name>Christian</name> belief, that his faith might have a new victory, and an eminent enthusiast went so far as to say that he believed because it was impossible&mdash;<hi rend="italics">credo quia impossible</hi>. But no such exalted faith is now required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>Here is no impossibility, nor is there any difficulty which will not yield to a faithful, well-directed endeavor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/>If to any timid soul the <rs>Enterprise</rs> seems impossible because it is too beautiful, then I say at once that it is too beautiful not to be possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>But descending from these summits, let me show plainly the object which it seeks to accomplish, and herein you shall see and confess its complete practicability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>While discountenancing all prejudice of color and every establishment of caste, the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs>&mdash;at least so far as I may speak for it&mdash;does not undertake to change human nature, or to force any individual into relations of life for which he is not morally, intellectually and socially adapted; nor does it necessarily assume that a race, degraded for long generations under the iron heel of bondage, can be lifted at once into all the political privileges of an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>But, sir, it does confidently assume, against all question, contradiction, or assault whatever, <hi rend="italics">that every man is entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and, with equal confidence</hi>, <hi rend="italics">it asserts that every individual, who wears the human form, whether <rs type="color">black</rs> or <rs type="color">white</rs>, should at once be recognized as man</hi>. I know not when this is done, what other trials may be in wait for the unhappy <rs>African</rs>; but this I do know, that the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs> will then have triumphed, and the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of Slavery</orgName>, <hi rend="italics">as defined by existing law</hi>, will no longer shock mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/><pb id="p.182" n="182"/></p> 
<p>In this work the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essential, practical requisite is, that the question shall be openly and frankly confronted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>Do not put it aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>Do not blink it out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>Do not dodge it. Approach it. Study it. Ponder it. Deal with it. Let it rest in the illumination of speech, conversation and the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>Let it fill the thoughts of the statesman and the prayers of the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>When Slavery is thus regarded, its true character will be recognized <hi rend="italics">as a hateful assemblage of unquestionable wrongs under the sanction of existing law</hi>, and good men will be moved at once to apply the remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>Already even its zealots admit that its <q direct="unspecified">abuses</q> should be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>This is their word and not mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>Alas! alas! sir, it is these very <q direct="unspecified">abuses</q> which constitute its component parts, without which it would not exist, even as the scourges in a bundle with the axe constituted the dread fasces of the <rs>Roman</rs> lictor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>Take away these, and the whole embodied outrage will disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>Surely that central assumption&mdash;more deadly than the axe itself&mdash;by which man is changed into a chattel, may be abandoned; and is not this practicable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>The associate scourges by which that transcendant <q direct="unspecified">abuse</q> is surrounded, may, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, be subtracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>The <q direct="unspecified">abuse</q> which substitutes concubinage for marriage&mdash;the <q direct="unspecified">abuse</q> which annuls the parental relation&mdash;the <q direct="unspecified">abuse</q> which closes the portals of knowledge&mdash;the <q direct="unspecified">abuse</q> which tyrannically usurps all the labor of another&mdash;now upheld by positive law, may by positive law be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>To say that this is not practicable, in the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century, would be a scandal upon mankind; and just in proportion as these <q direct="unspecified">abuses</q> cease to have the sanction of law, will the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of Slavery</orgName> cease to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>The <rs>African</rs>, whatever may then be his condition, will no longer be <hi rend="italics">the slave</hi> over whose wrongs and sorrows the world throbs at times fiercely indignant, and at times painfully sad, while with outstretched arms, he sends forth the piteous cry, <q direct="unspecified">Am I not a man and a brother?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/></p> 
<p>In pressing forward to this result, the inquiry is often presented, to what extent, if any, shall compensation be allowed to the slave-masters?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>Clearly, if the point be determined by <hi rend="italics">absolute justices</hi> not the masters but the slaves will be entitled to compensation; for it is the slaves, who, throughout weary generations, have been deprived of their toil, and all its fruits which went to enrich their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>Besides, it seems hardly reasonable to pay for the relinquishment of those disgusting <q direct="unspecified">abuses,</q> which, in their aggregation, constitute the bundle of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>Pray, sir, by what tariff, price current, or principle of equation, shall their several values be estimated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>What sum shall be counted out as the proper price for the abandonment of that pretension&mdash;more indecent than <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> the <hi rend="italics">jus primae noctis</hi> of the feudal age&mdash;which leaves woman, whether in the arms of master or slave, always a concubine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>What bribe shall be proffered for the restoration of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-given paternal rights?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>What money shall be paid for taking off the padlock by which souls are fastened down in darkness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>How much for a quit-claim to labor now meanly exacted by the strong from the weak?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>And what compensation shall be awarded for the egregious assumption, condemned by reason and abhorred by piety, which changes a man into a thing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>I put these questions without undertaking to pass upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>Shrinking instinctively from any recognition of <hi rend="italics">right founded on wrongs</hi>, I find myself shrinking also from any austere verdict, which shall deny the means necessary to the great consummation we seek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>Our fathers, under <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, did not hesitate by Act of Congress, to appropriate largely for the ransom of white fellow-citizens enslaved by <placeName key="tgn,2129174" n="1.000 10" reg="Algerine, Tuolumne, California">Algerine</placeName> corsairs; and, following this example, I am disposed to consider the question of compensation as <num value="1">one</num> of expediency, to be determined by the exigency of the hour and the constitutional powers of the <rs>Government</rs>; though such is my desire to see the foul fiend of slavery in flight, that I could not hesitate to build even a Bridge of Gold, if necessary, to promote his escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>The <hi rend="italics">Practicability</hi> of the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs> has been constantly questioned, often so superficially, as to be answered at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>I shall not take time to consider the allegation, founded on considerations of economy, which audaciously assumes that Slave Labor is more advantageous than Free Labor&mdash;that Slavery is more profitable than Freedom; for this is all exploded by the official tables of the census; nor that other futile argument, that the slaves are not prepared for Freedom, and, therefore, should not be precipitated into this condition,for that is no better than the ancient <rs>Greek</rs> folly, where the anxious mother would not allow her son to go into the water until he had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> learned to swim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2577"/>But, as against the <name>Necessity</name> of the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs>, there were <num value="2">two</num> chief objections, so, also, against its Practicability there are <num value="2">two</num>; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, founded on its alleged danger to the master, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, on its alleged damage to the slave himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/><num value="1">1</num>. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objection, founded on the alleged <hi rend="italics">danger to the master</hi>, most generally takes the extravagant form, that the slave, if released from his present condition, would cut his master's throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2579"/>Here is a blatant paradox, which can pass for reason only among those who have lost their reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2580"/>With an absurdity which finds no parallel except in the defences of Slavery, it assumes that the <name>African</name>, when treated justly, <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> will show a vindictiveness which he does not exhibit when treated unjustly; that when elevated by the blessings of Freedom, he will develop an appetite for blood which he never manifested when crushed by the curse of bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2581"/>At present, the slave sees his wife ravished from his arms&mdash;sees his infant swept away to the auction block&mdash;sees the heavenly gates of knowledge shut upon him&mdash;sees his industry and all its fruits unjustly snatched by another&mdash;sees himself and offspring doomed to a servitude from which there is no redemption; and still his master sleeps secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>Will the master sleep less secure, when the slave no longer smarts under these revolting atrocities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>I will not trifle with your intelligence, or with the quick-passing hour, by arguing this question.</p></quote></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>By a single Act of Parliament, the slaves of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName> became at once free; and this great transition was accomplished absolutely without personal danger of any kind to the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>And yet the chance of danger there was greater far than among us. In our broad country, the slaves are overshadowed by a more than <num value="6">six</num>-fold white population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>Only in <num value="2">two</num> States&mdash;<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>&mdash;do the slaves outnumber the whites, and these but slightly, while in the entire Slave States, the whites outnumber the slaves by many <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>But it was otherwise in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">British West Indies</placeName>, where the whites were overshadowed by a more than <num value="6">six</num>-fold population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>The slaves were <num value="800000">800,000</num>, while the whites numbered only <num value="131000">131,000</num>, distributed in different proportions on the different islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>And this disproportion has since increased rather than diminished, always without danger to the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>In <placeName reg="Jamaica, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005556">Jamaica</placeName>, the largest of these possessions, there are now upwards of <num value="400000">400,000</num> Africans, and only <num value="37000">37,000</num> whites; in <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName>, the next largest possession, there are <num value="120000">120,000</num> Africans, and only <num value="15000">15,000</num> whites; in <placeName reg="Saint Lucia" key="tgn,7004772">St. Lucia</placeName>, <num value="19500">19,500</num> Africans, and only <num value="600">600</num> whites; in <placeName key="tgn,7004788" n="1.000 10" reg="Tobago,Trinidad and Tobago,North and Central America">Tobago</placeName>, <num value="14000">14,000</num> Africans, and only <num value="600">600</num> whites; in Montserrat, <num value="6000">6,000</num> Africans, and only <num value="150">150</num> whites; and in the <name>Grenadines</name>, upwards of <num value="6000">6,000</num> Africans, and less than <num value="50">50</num> whites.

And I am now brought to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> objection, founded on the alleged <hi rend="italics">damage to the slave</hi>. It is common among the partisans of Slavery, to assert that our Enterprise has actually retarded the very cause it seeks to promote; and this paradoxical accusation, which might naturally show itself among the rank weeds of the <rs>South</rs>, is cherished here on our Northern soil, by those who anxiously look for any fig-leaf with which to cover their indifference or tergiversation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2596"/>This peculiar form of complaint is an old device, which has been instinctively employed on other occasions until it has ceased to be even plausible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2597"/>Thus, throughout all times, has every good cause been encountered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>The Saviour was nailed to the cross with a crown of thorns on his head, as a disturber of that peace on earth which he came to declare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2599"/>The disciples, while preaching the <name>Gospel</name> of forgiveness and good-will, were stoned as preachers of sedition and discord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2600"/>The reformers, who sought to establish a higher piety and faith, were burnt at the stake as blasphemers and infidels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2601"/>Patriots, in all ages, who have striven for their country's good, have been doomed to the scaffold or to exile, even as their country's enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>And those brave Englishmen, who, at home, under the lead of <persName n="Burke,,Edmund,,," id="n0184.0053.00185.00516" reg="default:Burke,Edmund,,,"><foreName>Edmund</foreName> <surname>Burke</surname></persName>, even against their own country, espoused the cause of our fathers, shared the same illogical impeachment, which was touched to the quick by that orator-statesman, when, after exposing its essential vice, <q direct="unspecified">in attributing the ill-effect of ill-judged conduct to the arguments used to dissuade us from it,</q> he denounced it as <q direct="unspecified">very absurd, but very common in modern practice, and very wicked.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>Ay, sir, it is common in modern practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, it has vainly renewed itself with special frequency against the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> Societies; against the friends of education; against the patrons of vaccination; against the partisans of peace, all of whom have been openly arraigned as provoking and increasing the very evils, whether of infidelity, idleness, disease, or war, which they benignly sought to check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>And to bring an instance which is precisely applicable to our own, <persName n="Wilberforce,,,,," id="n0184.0053.00185.00517" reg="nearbymention:Wilberforce,William,,,"><surname>Wilberforce</surname></persName>, when conducting the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> against the slave-trade and then against Slavery itself, was told that those efforts, by which his name is now consecrated forevermore, tended <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> to increase the hardships of the slave, even to the extent of riveting anew his chains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>Such are the precedents for the imputation to which our Enterprise is exposed; and such, also, are the precedents by which I exhibit the fallacy of the imputation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>Sir, I do not doubt that the <rs>Enterprise</rs> has produced heat and irritation, amounting often to inflammation, among slave-masters, which, to superficial minds, may seem inconsistent with success; but which the careful observer will recognize at once as the natural and not unhealthy effort of a diseased body to purge itself of existing impurities; and just in proportion to the malignity of the concealed poison, will be the extent of inflammation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>A distemper like Slavery cannot be ejected like a splinter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>It is, perhaps, too much to expect that men thus tortured should reason calmly&mdash;that patients thus suffering should comprehend the true nature of their case and kindly acknowledge the beneficent work; but not on this account can it be suspended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>In the face of this complaint, I assert that the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs> has already accomplished incalculable good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>Even now it touches the national heart as it never before was touched, sweeping its strings with a might to draw forth emotions such as no political struggle has ever evoked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>It moves the young, the middle-aged, and the old. It enters the family circle, and mingles with the flame of the household hearth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>It reaches the souls of mothers, wives, sisters and daughters, filling all with a new aspiration for justice on earth, and awakening not merely a sentiment against Slavery, such as prevailed with our fathers, but a deep, undying conviction of its wrong, and a determination to leave no effort unattempted for its removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>With the sympathies of all Christendom as allies, it has already encompassed the slave-masters by a <hi rend="italics">moral blockade</hi>, invisible to the eye, but more potent than navies, from which there can be no escape except in final capitulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>Thus it has created the irresistible influence which itself constitutes the beginning of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>Already there are signs of change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>In common speech, as well as in writing, among slave-masters the bondman is no longer called a <hi rend="italics">slave</hi>, but a <hi rend="italics">servant</hi>,&mdash;thus, by a soft substitution, concealing and condemning the true relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>Even newspapers in the land of bondage blush with indignation at the hunt of men by blood-hounds, thus protesting against an unquestionable incident of Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>Other signs are found in the added comfort of the slave; in the enlarged attention to his wants; in the experiments now beginning, by which the slave is enabled to share in the profits of his labor, and thus finally secure his freedom; and, above all, in the consciousness among slave-masters <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> themselves, that they dwell now as never before under the keen observation of an ever-wakeful Public Opinion, quickened by an ever-wakeful Public Press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>Nor is this all. Only lately propositions have been introduced into the <name>Legislatures</name> of different States, and countenanced by Governors, to mitigate the existing law of Slavery; and, almost while speaking, I have received the drafts of <num value="2">two</num> different memorials,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> addressed to the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName>, and the other to that of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>,&mdash;asking for the slave <num value="3">three</num> things, which it will be monstrous to refuse, but which, if conceded, will take from Slavery its existing character;&mdash;I mean, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the protection of the marriage relation; secondly, the protection of the parental relation; and, thirdly, the privilege of knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>Such men we encounter daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>You all know them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>Among them are men in every department of human activity&mdash;who perpetually buy, build and plan&mdash;who shrink from no labor&mdash;who are daunted by no peril of commercial adventure, by no hardihood of industrial enterprise&mdash;who, reaching in their undertakings across oceans and continents, would undertake <q direct="unspecified">to put a girdle about the earth in <measure n="40seconds" type="date">forty seconds</measure>;</q> and yet, disheartened, they can join in no effort against Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>Others there are, especially among the youthful and enthusiastic, who vainly sigh because they were not born in the age of chivalry, or at least in the days of the revolution, not thinking that in this Enterprise there is an opportunity of lofty endeavor such as no Paladin of chivalry, or chief of the revolution enjoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>Others there are, who freely bestow their means and time upon the distant inaccessible heathen of another hemisphere, in the islands of the sea; and yet they can do nothing to mitigate our grander heathenism here at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>While confessing that it ought to disappear from the earth, they forego, renounce and abandon all exertion <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> against it. Others there are still, (such is human inconsistency!) who plant the tree in whose full-grown shade they can never expect to sit&mdash;who hopefully drop the acorn in the earth, trusting that the oak which it sends upwards to the skies will shelter their children beneath its shade; but they will do nothing to plant or nurture the great tree of Liberty, that it may cover with its arms unborn generations of men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>Others still there are, particularly in the large cities, who content themselves by occasional contributions to the redemption of a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>To this object they give out of ample riches, and thus seek to silence the monitions of conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>Now, I would not discountenance any form of activity by which Human Freedom, even in a single case, may be secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>But I desire to say, that such an act&mdash;too often accompanied by a pharisaical pretension, in strange contrast with the petty performance&mdash;cannot be considered an essential aid to the <rs>Anti-Slavery Enterprise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>Not in this way can any impression be made on an evil so vast as Slavery&mdash;as you will clearly see by an illustration which I shall give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>The failure of even his extraordinary strength was explained, when he learned that the simple cup had communicated, by an invisible connection, with the whole vast ocean behind, out of which it was perpetually supplied, and which remained absolutely unaffected by the effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>And just so will these occasions of charity, though encountered by the largest private means, be constantly renewed, for they communicate with the whole <placeName reg="Black Sea" key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName> of Slavery behind, out of which they are perpetually supplied, and which remains absolutely unaffected by the effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>Sir, private means may cope with individual necessities, but they are powerless to redress the evils of a wicked institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>Charity is limited and local; the evils of Slavery are infinite and everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>Besides, a wrong organized and upheld by law, can be removed only through a change of the law. Not, then, by an occasional contribution to ransom a slave can your duty be done in this great cause; but only by earnest, constant, valiant efforts against the institution&mdash;against the law&mdash;which makes slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>I am not insensible to the difficulties of this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>Full well I know the power of Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>Full well I know all its various intrenchments in the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, the politics and the prejudices of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>But these things can furnish no motive or apology for indifference, or for any folding of the hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>Surely the wrong is not less wrong because it is gigantic; the evil is not less evil because it is immeasurable; nor can the duty of perpetual warfare with wrong or evil be in this instance suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>Nay, because Slavery is powerful&mdash;because the <rs>Enterprise</rs> is difficult&mdash;therefore is the duty of all more exigent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>The well-tempered soul does not yield to difficulties, but presses <hi rend="italics">onward forever</hi> with increased resolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>And here the question occurs, which is so often pressed in argument, or in taunt, <hi rend="italics">What have we at the <rs>North</rs> to do with Slavery</hi>? In answer, I might content myself by saying that as members of the human family, bound together by the cords of a common manhood, there is no human wrong to which we can justly be insensible, nor is there any human sorrow which we should not seek to relieve; but I prefer to say, on this occasion, that, as citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, anxious for the good name, the repose and the prosperity of the <rs>Republic</rs>&mdash;that it may be a blessing and not a curse to mankind&mdash;there is nothing among all its diversified interests, under the <rs>National Constitution</rs>, with which, at this moment, we have so much to do; nor is there anything with regard to which our duties are so irresistibly clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>I do not dwell on the scandal of Slavery in the national capital&ndash;of Slavery in the national territories&mdash;of the coast-wise slave-trade on the high seas beneath the national flag,&mdash;all of which are outside of State limits, and within the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress, where you and I, sir, and every freeman of the <rs>North</rs>, are compelled to share the responsibility and help to bind the chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>To dislodge Slavery from these usurped footholds under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and thus at once to relieve ourselves from a grievous responsibility, and to begin the great work of emancipation, were an object worthy of an exalted ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>But before even this can be commenced, there is a great work, more than any other important and urgent, which must be consummated in the domain of national politics, and also here at home in the <rs>Free States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>The National Government itself must be emancipated, so that it shall no longer wear the yoke of servitude; and Slavery in all its pretensions must be dislodged from its usurped foothold, in the <rs>Free States</rs> themselves, thus relieving ourselves from a grievous responsibility at our own door, and emancipating the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>Emancipation, even within the national jurisdiction, can be achieved only through the emancipation of the <rs>Free States</rs>, accompanied by the complete emancipation of the <rs>National Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>Thus are we prompted to their rescue, not only to save them, but also to save ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>The tyranny which now treads them down, has already trampled on us, and only awaits an opportunity to do it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>In its complete overthrow is the only way of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>Indeed, this must be done before anything else can be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>In vain you seek economy in the <rs>Government</rs>&mdash;improvement of rivers and harbors&mdash;or dignity and peace in our foreign relations, while this power holds the national purse and the national sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>Prostrate the <rs>Slave Oligarchy</rs>, and the door will be wide open for all generous reforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>Oh! the imagination loses itself in the vain endeavor to picture the good that will be then accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>Prostrate the <rs>Slave Oligarchy</rs>, and Liberty will become the universal law of all the national territories; Slavery will cease at once in the national capital; the slave trade will no longer skulk along our coasts beneath the national flag; and the wickedness of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Bill</rs> will be driven from the statute-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>Prostrate the <rs>Slave Oligarchy</rs>, and the national Government will be at length divorced from Slavery, and the national policy will be changed from Slavery to Freedom.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>To this work, fellow-citizens, you are now summoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>By your votes you are to declare, not merely your predilection for men, but your devotion to principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>Men are erring and mortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>Principles are steadfast and immortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>Forgetting all other things&mdash;especially forgetting men&mdash;you are to cast your votes so as best to promote Freedom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>But in the choice of men we are driven to the organization of parties; and here occurs the practical question on which hinges our immediate duty, by what <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> can our desire be accomplished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>There are individuals in all the parties, even the <rs>Democratic</rs>, who hate Slavery, and say so; but a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> cannot be judged by the private opinions of some of its members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>Something else, more solid and tangible, must appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>The party that we select to bear the burden and honor of our great controversy, must be adapted to the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>It must be a perfect machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>Wedded to Freedom, for better or for worse, and cleaving to it with a grasp never to be unloosed, it must be clear, open and unequivocal in its declarations, and must admit no other question to divert its energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>It must be all in Freedom, and, like <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0184.0064.00216.00577" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>'s wife, it must be above suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>But besides this character which it must sustain in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, it must be prepared to take its place in close phalanx with the united masses of the <rs>North</rs>, now organizing through all the <rs>Free States</rs>, <hi rend="italics">junctaeque umbone phalanges</hi>, for the protection of Freedom, and the overthrow of the <rs>Slave Oligarchy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>Bearing these conditions in mind, there are <num value="3">three</num> parties which we may dismiss, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, as they pass in review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>Men do not gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles; nor do they expect patriotism from <persName n="Arnold,,Benedict,,," id="n0184.0064.00216.00578" reg="default:Arnold,Benedict,,,"><foreName>Benedict</foreName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>A party which sustains the tyrannies and perfidies of the <rs>Slave Oligarchy</rs>, and is represented by the <rs>President</rs>, through whom has come so much of all our woe, need not occupy our time; and such is the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>If there be within the sound of my voice a single person, who, professing sympathy with Freedom, still votes with this party, to him I would say: The name of Democrat is a tower of strength; let it not be a bulwark of Slavery; for the sake of a name do not sacrifice a thing; for the sake of party do not surrender Freedom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>According to a familiar rule, handed down from distant antiquity, we <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> are to say nothing but good of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>How, then, shall I speak of the late powerful Whig party&mdash;by whose giant contests the whole country was once upheaved&mdash;but which has now ceased to exist, except as the shadow of a name?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>Here, in <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 191" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName>, a few who do not yet know that it is dead, have met together and proffered their old allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>They are the <rs>Rip Van Winkles</rs> of our politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/>This respectable charter, falling asleep in the mountains, drowsed undisturbed throughout the whole war of the <name>Revolution</name>, and, then returning to his native village, ignorant of all that had passed, proposed to drink the health of <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>But our Whigs are less tolerant and urbane than this awakened Dutchman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>In petulant and irrational assumptions they are like the unfortunate judge, who, being aroused from his slumbers on the bench by a sudden crash of thunder, exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Crier,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0064.00217.00579" reg="mostcommon:Crier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crier</surname></persName>, stop the noise in Court.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>The thunder would not be hushed; nor will the voice of Freedom, now reverberating throughout the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>Some there are among these who openly espouse the part of Slavery, while others, by their indifference, place themselves in the same unhappy company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>If their position at this moment were of sufficient importance to justify grave remark, they should be exhibited as kindred in spirit and isolation to the <name>Tories</name> of our Revolution, or, at least, as the <name>Bourbons</name> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>&mdash;always claiming everything, learning nothing, forgetting nothing, and at last condemned by an aroused people for their disloyalty to Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>Let no person who truly loves Freedom join this company, tempted by its name, its music, and its banners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>There is still another party, which claims your votes, but permit me to say, at this crisis, with small pretence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>I am at a loss to determine the name by which it may be properly called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>It is sometimes known as the <orgName n="Know Nothing party" type="party">Know-Nothing party</orgName>; sometimes as the <rs>American</rs> party; but it cannot be entitled to these designations&mdash;if they be of any value&mdash;for it does not claim to belong to the organization, which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assumed and still retains them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/>It is an isolated combination, peculiar to <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, which, while professing certain political sentiments, is bound together by the support of <num value="1">one</num> of the candidates for Governor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>At this moment this is its controlling idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>It is, therefore, a <hi rend="italics">personal party</hi>, and I trust that I shall not be considered as departing from that courtesy which is with me a law, if I say that, in the absence of any appropriate name, expressive of principles, it may properly take its designation from the candidate it supports.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>Of course, such a party wants the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essential condition of the organization which we seek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>It is a <hi rend="italics">personal party</hi>, whose controlling idea <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> is a predilection for a man and not a principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>Whatever may be the private sentiments of some of its members, clearly it is not a party wedded to Freedom, for better and for worse, and cleaving to it with a grasp never to be unloosed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>While professing opposition to Slavery it also arraigns <persName n="Catholics,,,,," id="n0184.0064.00218.00580" reg="mostcommon:Catholics,nomatch:0"><surname>Catholics</surname></persName> and foreigners, and allows the question of their privileges to disturb its energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>It is not all in Freedom; nor is it, like <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0184.0064.00218.00581" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>'s wife, above suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>Besides, even as a party of Freedom, it is powerless from its isolation; for it stands by itself, and is in no way associated with that great phalanx now rallying throughout the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>In this condition should it continue to exist, it will, in the coning Presidential contest, from natural affinity lapse back into the <rs>American</rs> party of the country which is ranged on the side of Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>Of course, as a separate party, it is necessarily short-lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3041"/>Cut off from the main body, it may still show a brief vitality, as the head of a turtle still bites for some days after it is severed from the neck: but it can have no permanent existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>Surely this is not the party of Freedom which we seek.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>But the incompetency of this party, as the organ of our cause, is enhanced by the uncongenial secrecy in which it had its origin and yet shrouds itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>For myself, let me say that, on the floor of the <name>Senate</name> I have striven, by vote and speech, in conjunction with my distinguished friend <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0064.00218.00582" reg="mostcommon:Chase,Salmon,P.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, for the limitation of the secret sessions of that body, under shelter of which so much of the business of the nation is transacted, and I have there presented the example of that ancient <name>Roman</name>, &mdash;who bade his architect so to construct his house that his guests and all that they did might be seen by the world,&mdash;as a fit model for American institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>What I have urged there I now urge here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>But the special aims which this party proposes, seems to be in harmony with the darkness in which it begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>Even if justifiable, on any grounds of public policy, they should not be associated with our cause; but I am unwilling to allude to them without expressing my frank dissent.</p></quote></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>Let us see if there be any reason in this; and here indulge me with <num value="1">one</num> word on foreigners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>With the ancient <rs>Greeks</rs>, a foreigner was a <hi rend="italics">barbarian</hi>, and with the ancient <rs>Romans</rs>, he was an <hi rend="italics">enemy</hi>. In early modern times, the austerity of this judgment was relaxed; but, under the influence of feudalism, the different sovereignties, whether provinces or nations, were kept in a condition of isolation, from which they have been gradually passing until now, when provinces are merged into nations, and nations are giving signs that they too will yet commingle into <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>In our country another example is already displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/>From all nations people commingle here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>At no time since the discovery of the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> has the army of emigrants pressed so strongly in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>In similar strain, I would say, <q direct="unspecified">Where Liberty is, there is my party.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>Such an organization is now happily constituted here in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and in all the <rs>Free States</rs>, under the name of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>In assuming our place as a distinct party, we simply give form and direction, in harmony with the usage and genius of popular governments, to a movement which stirs the whole country, and does not find an adequate and constant organ in either of the other existing parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>The early opposition to Slavery was simply a sentiment, out-gushing from the hearts of the sensitive and humane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>In the lapse of time it became a determined principle, inspiring larger numbers, and showing itself <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in an organized endeavor to resist the annexation of slaveholding <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>; next, to prohibit Slavery in newly acquired territories: and now, alarmed by the overthrow of all rights in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and the domination of the <rs>Slave Oligarchy</rs> throughout the <rs>Republic</rs>, it breaks forth in a stronger effort, a wider union, and a deeper channel inspiring yet larger numbers and firmer resolves, while opposite quarters contribute to its power&mdash;even as the fountain, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> out-gushing from the weeping sides of its pure mountain home, trickles in the rill, leaps in the <pb id="p.222" n="222"/> torrent, and flows in the river, till at last, swollen with accumulated waters, it presses onward, forever onward, in irresistible beneficent current, fertilizing and uniting the spaces which it traverses, washing the feet of cities, and wooing states to repose upon its banks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>Our party has its origin in the exigencies of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>Vowing ourselves against Slavery wherever it exists, whether enforced by the <rs>Russian</rs> knout, the <name>Turkish</name> bastinado, or the lash of the <rs>Carolina</rs> planter, we do not seek to interfere with it at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002473" n="1.000 10" reg="Istanbul,Istanbul,Marmara,Turkiye,Asia">Constantinople</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>; nor does any such grave duty rest upon us. Our political duties are properly limited by our political responsibilities; and we are in no just sense responsible for the local law or usage by which human bondage in these places is upheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>But wherever we are responsible for the wrong, there our duty begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>The object to which, as a party, we are pledged, is all contained in the acceptance of the issue which the <rs>Slave Oligarchy</rs> tenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>To its repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, and its imperious demand that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> shall be surrendered to Slavery, we reply, that Freedom shall be made the universal law of all the national domain, without compromise, and that hereafter no Slave State shall be admitted into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>To its tyrannical assumption of supremacy in the <rs>National Government</rs>, we reply that the <rs>Slave Oligarchy</rs> shall be overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>Such is the practical purpose of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican Party</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>It is to uphold and advance this cause, that we have come together, leaving the parties to which we have been respectively attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>Now, in the course of human events, it becomes our duty to dissolve the political bands which bound us to the old organizations, and to assume a separate existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>Our <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>Let us, in the spirit of our Fathers, pledge ourselves to sustain it with our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>In thus associating and harmonizing from opposite quarters, in order to promote a common cause, we have learned to forget former differences, and to appreciate the motives of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>We have learned how trivial are the matters on which we may disagree, compared with the <name>Great Issue</name> on which we all agree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>Old prejudices have vanished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>Even the rancors of political antagonism have been changed and dissolved, as in a potent alembic, by the natural irresistible affinities of Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>In our union we have ceased to wear the badges of either of the old organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>We have become a new party, distinct, independent, permanent, under a new name, with Liberty as our watchword, and our flag inscribed, <q direct="unspecified">By this sign conquer.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/></p> 
<p>Again, it is objected that the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is <hi rend="italics">against the <rs>Union</rs></hi>, <pb id="p.223" n="223"/> and we are reminded of the priceless blessings which come from this fountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>Here is another bugbear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>With us the <rs>Union</rs> is not the object of mere lip service, but it is cherished in simple sincerity, as the aged <rs>Lear</rs> was loved by his only faithful daughter, <q direct="unspecified">according to her bond, no more nor less.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>Our party does nothing against the <rs>Union</rs>, but everything for it. It strives to guard those great principles which the <rs>Union</rs> was established to secure, and thus to keep it ever worthy of our love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>It seeks to overthrow that baleful Oligarchy, under which the <rs>Union</rs> has been changed from a vessel of honor to a vessel of dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>In this patriot work it will persevere, regardless of menace from any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>Not that I love the <rs>Union</rs> less but Freedom more, do I now, in pleading this great cause, insist that Freedom, at all hazards, shall be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid, that for the sake of the <rs>Union</rs>, we should sacrifice the very things for which the <rs>Union</rs> was made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>And yet again, it is objected that ours is a party of a <hi rend="italics">single idea</hi>. This is a phrase, and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>The party may not recognize certain measures of public policy, deemed by some of special importance; but it does what is better, and what other parties fail to do. It acknowledges that beneficent principle, which, like the great central light, vivifies all, and without which all is dark and sterile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>The moving cause and the animating soul of our party, is the idea of Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>But this idea is manifold in character and influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>It is the idea of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>It is the great idea of the founders of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3126"/>It is the idea which combined our Fathers on the heights of <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>; which carried <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> through a <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> war; which inspired <persName n="Lafayette,,,,," id="n0184.0066.00223.00596" reg="mostcommon:Lafayette,nomatch:0"><surname>Lafayette</surname></persName>; which touched with coals of fire the lips of <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n0184.0066.00223.00597" reg="nearbymention:Adams,John,,,"><surname>Adams</surname></persName>, <persName n="Otis,,,,," id="n0184.0066.00223.00598" reg="nearbymention:Otis,James,,,"><surname>Otis</surname></persName>, and <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3127"/>Ours is an idea, which is at least noble and elevating; it is an idea which draws in its train virtue, goodness, and all the charities of life, all that makes earth a home of improvement and happiness&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>Not in plundered provinces or in the cruelties of selfish governors will you find its parallel; and yet there is an ancient instance which may show, at least, the path of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>But, amidst charges of robbery and sacrilege, the enormity which most aroused the indignant voice of his accuser, and which still stands forth with strongest distinctness, arousing the sympathetic indignation of all who read the story, was, that away in <placeName key="tgn,7003122" n="1.000 11" reg="sicilia">Sicily</placeName> he had scourged a citizen of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>,&mdash;that the cry, <q direct="unspecified">I am a <orgName n="Roman Citizen" type="newspaper">Roman citizen</orgName>,</q> had been interposed in vain against the lash of the tyrant governor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>Sir, speaking in an age of light, and in a land of constitutional liberty, where the safeguards of elections are justly placed among the highest triumphs of civilization, I fearlessly assert that the wrongs of much-abused <placeName key="tgn,7003122" n="1.000 11" reg="sicilia">Sicily</placeName>, thus memorable in history, were small by the side of the wrongs of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, where the very shrines of popular institutions, more sacred than any heathen altar, are desecrated,&mdash;where the ballot-box, more precious than any work in ivory or marble from the cunning hand of Art, is plundered,&mdash;and where the cry, <q direct="unspecified">I am an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>,</q> is interposed in vain against outrage of every kind, even upon life itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>This enormity, vast beyond comparison, swells to dimensions of crime which the imagination toils in vain to grasp, when it is understood that for this purpose are hazarded the horrors of intestine feud, not only in this distant Territory, but everywhere throughout the country.

<p>Such is the <name>Crime</name> which you are to judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>The criminal also must be dragged into day, that you may see and measure the power by which all this wrong is sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>From no common source could it proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>In its perpetration was needed a spirit of vaulting ambition which would hesitate at nothing; a hardihood of purpose insensible to the judgment of mankind; a madness for Slavery, in spite of Constitution, laws, and all the great examples of our history; also a consciousness of power such as comes from the habit of power; a combination of energies found only in a <num value="100">hundred</num> arms directed by a <num value="100">hundred</num> eyes; a control of Public Opinion through venal pens and a prostituted press; an ability to subsidize crowds in every vocation of life,&mdash;the politician with his local importance, the lawyer with his subtle tongue, and even the authority of the judge on the bench,&mdash;with a familiar use of men in places high and low, so that none, from the <rs>President</rs> to the lowest <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> border postmaster, should decline to be its tool: all these things, and more, were needed, and they were found in the <rs>Slave Power</rs> of our Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>There, Sir, stands the criminal, all unmasked before you, heartless, grasping, and tyrannical, with an audacity beyond that of <persName n="Verres,,,,," id="n0184.0087.00266.00818" reg="mostcommon:Verres,nomatch:0"><surname>Verres</surname></persName>, a subtlety beyond that of Machiavel, a meanness beyond that of <persName n="Bacon,,,,," id="n0184.0087.00266.00819" reg="mostcommon:Bacon,nomatch:0"><surname>Bacon</surname></persName>, and an ability beyond that of <persName n="Hastings,,,,," id="n0184.0087.00266.00820" reg="nearbymention:Hastings,Warren,,,"><surname>Hastings</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>In opening this great matter, I am not insensible to the austere demands of the occasion; but the dependence of the <name>Crime</name> against <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> upon the <rs>Slave Power</rs> is so peculiar and important that I trust to be pardoned while I impress it by an illustration which to some may seem trivial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>It is related in Northern Mythology, that the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Force, visiting an enchanted region, was challenged by his royal entertainer to what seemed a humble feat of strength,&mdash;merely, Sir, to lift a cat from the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>The <name n="God" type="God">god</name> smiled at the challenge, and, calmly placing his hand under the belly of the animal, with superhuman strength strove, while the back of the feline monster arched far upwards, even beyond reach, and <num value="1">one</num> paw actually forsook the earth, when at last the discomfited divinity desisted; but he was little surprised at his defeat, when he learned that this creature, which seemed to be a cat, and nothing more, was not merely a cat, but that it belonged to and was part of the great Terrestrial Serpent which in its innumerable folds encircled the whole globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>Even so the creature whose paws are now fastened upon <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, whatever it may seem to be, constitutes in reality part of the <rs>Slave Power</rs>, which, with loathsome folds, is now coiled about the whole land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>Thus do I exhibit the extent of the present contest, where we encounter not merely local resistance, but also the unconquered sustaining arm behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/>But from the vastness of the <name>Crime</name> attempted, with all its woe and shame, I derive well-founded assurance of commensurate effort by the aroused masses of the country, determined not only to vindicate Right against Wrong, but to redeem the <rs>Republic</rs> from the thraldom of that Oligarchy which prompts, directs, and concentrates the distant wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/><pb id="p.267" n="267"/></p> 
<p>Such is the <name>Crime</name> and such the criminal which it is my duty to expose; and, by the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, this duty shall be done completely to the end. But this will not be enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>The Apologies which, with strange hardihood, are offered for the <name>Crime</name> must be torn away, so that it shall stand forth without a single rag or fig-leaf to cover its vileness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>And, finally, the <rs>True Remedy</rs> must be shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3760"/>The subject is complex in relations, as it is transcendent in importance; and yet, if I am honored by your attention, I hope to present it clearly in all its parts, while I conduct you to the inevitable conclusion that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> must be admitted at once, with her present Constitution, as a State of this Union, and give a new star to the blue field of our National Flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>And here I derive satisfaction from the thought, that the cause is so strong in itself as to bear even the infirmities of its advocates; nor can it require anything beyond that simplicity of treatment and moderation of manner which I desire to cultivate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>Its true character is such, that, like <persName n="Hercules,,,,," id="n0184.0088.00267.00821" reg="mostcommon:Hercules,nomatch:0"><surname>Hercules</surname></persName>, it will conquer just so soon as it is recognized.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3773"/>It is well remarked by a distinguished historian of our country, that, <q direct="unspecified">at the <name>Ithuriel</name> touch of the <rs>Missouri</rs> discussion, the <rs>Slave Interest</rs>, hitherto hardly recognized as a distinct element in our system, started up portentous and dilated,</q> with threats and assumptions which are <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> the origin of our existing national politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3776"/>Here was a solemn act of legislation, called at the time compromise, covenant, compact, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought forward in this body by a slaveholder, vindicated in debate by slaveholders, finally sanctioned by slaveholding votes,&mdash;also upheld at the time by the essential approbation of a slaveholding <rs type="role2">President</rs>, <persName n="Monroe,,James,,," id="n0184.0089.00268.00822" reg="default:Monroe,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, and his Cabinet, of whom a majority were slaveholders, including <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0089.00268.00823" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> himself; and this compromise was made the condition of the admission of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, without which that State could not have been received into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3777"/>The bargain was simple, and was applicable, of course, only to the territory named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3791"/>With some the apology was the alleged rights of slaveholders; with others it was the alleged rights of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3792"/>With some it was openly the extension of Slavery; and with others it was openly the establishment of Freedom, under the guise of Popular Sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3793"/>The measure, thus upheld in defiance of reason, was carried through Congress in defiance of all securities of legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3794"/>These things I mention that you may see in what foulness the present Crime was engendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3803"/>I make no personal imputations, but only with frankness, such as belongs to the occasion and my own character, describe a great historical act, now enrolled in the <rs>Capitol</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>Sir, the <rs>Nebraska Bill</rs> was in every respect a swindle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3805"/>It was a swindle of the <rs>North</rs> by the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/>On the part of those who had already completely enjoyed their share of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, it was a swindle of those whose share was yet absolutely untouched; and the plea of unconstitutionality set up&mdash;like the plea of usury after the borrowed money has been enjoyed&mdash;did not make it less a swindle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>Urged as a bill of peace, it was a swindle of the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/>Urged as opening the doors to slave-masters with their slaves, it was a swindle of Popular Sovereignty in its asserted doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3809"/>Urged as sanctioning Popular Sovereignty, it was a swindle of slave-masters in their asserted rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3810"/>It was a swindle of a broad territory, thus cheated of protection against Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3811"/>It was a swindle of a great cause, early espoused by <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0184.0091.00270.00825" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:3"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0184.0091.00270.00826" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,Benjamin,,,:5"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0184.0091.00270.00827" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, surrounded by the best fathers of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3813"/>Turn it over, look at it on all sides, and it is everywhere a swindle; and if the word I now employ has not the authority of classical usage, it has, on this occasion, the indubitable authority of fitness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3814"/>No other word will adequately express the mingled meanness and wickedness of the cheat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3815"/>Its character is still further apparent in the general structure of the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3816"/>Amidst overflowing professions of regard for the sovereignty of the people in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, they are despoiled of every essential privilege of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3817"/>They are not allowed to choose Governor, <rs type="role" n="Secretary">Secretary</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief-Justice</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Associate-Justice">Associate Justices</rs>, Attorney, or <rs type="role2">Marshal</rs>,&mdash;all of whom are sent from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; nor are they allowed to regulate the salaries of any of these functionaries, or the daily allowance of the legislative body, or even the pay of the clerks and doorkeepers: but they are left free to adopt Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3818"/>And this is nicknamed Popular Sovereignty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3819"/>Time does not allow, nor does the occasion require, that I should stop to dwell on this transparent device to cover a transcendent wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3820"/>Suffice it to say, that Slavery is in itself an arrogant denial of human rights, and by no human reason can the power to establish such a wrong be placed among the attributes of any just sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3821"/>In <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> refusing it such a place, I do not deny popular rights, but uphold them, I do not restrain popular rights, but extend them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3822"/>And, Sir, to this conclusion you must yet come, unless deaf, not only to the admonitions of political justice, but also to the genius of our Constitution, under which, when properly interpreted, no valid claim for Slavery can be set up anywhere in the <rs type="place">National territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3823"/>The <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName> [<persName n="Cass,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0091.00271.00828" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName>] may say, in response to the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> [<persName n="Brown,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0091.00271.00829" reg="mostcommon:Brown,John,,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>], that Slavery cannot go into the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, without legislative introduction; and permit me to add, in response to both, that Slavery cannot go there at all. <hi rend="italics">Nothing can come out of nothing;</hi> and there is absolutely nothing in the <rs>Constitution</rs> out of which Slavery can be derived, while there are provisions, which, when properly interpreted, make its existence anywhere within the exclusive National jurisdiction impossible.</p></quote></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>The offensive provision in the bill is in its form a legislative anomaly, utterly wanting the natural directness and simplicity of an honest transaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>It does not undertake openly to repeal the old Prohibition of Slavery, but seems to mince the matter, as if conscious of the swindle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3826"/>It says that this Prohibition, <q direct="unspecified">being inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention by Congress with Slavery in the <name>States</name> and Territories, as recognized by the legislation of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, commonly called the <rs>Compromise Measures</rs>, is hereby declared inoperative and void.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>Thus, with insidious ostentation, is it pretended that an act violating the greatest compromise of our legislative history, and loosening the foundations of all compromise, is derived out of a compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>Then follows in the bill the further declaration, entirely without precedent, which has been aptly called <q direct="unspecified">a stump speech in its belly,</q> namely, <q direct="unspecified">it being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate Slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>Here are smooth words, such as belong to a cunning tongue enlisted in a bad cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>But whatever may have been their various hidden meanings, this at least is evident, that, by their effect, the <name>Congressional</name> prohibition of Slavery, which had always been regarded as a <num value="7">seven</num>-fold shield, covering the whole <placeName reg="Louisiana, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana Territory</placeName> north of <num value="36">36</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime;, is now removed, while a principle is declared which renders the supplementary <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> prohibition of Slavery in <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName>, <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> <q direct="unspecified">inoperative and void,</q> and thus opens to Slavery all these vast regions, now the rude cradles of mighty States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3831"/>Here you see the magnitude of the mischief contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3832"/>But my purpose is with the <name>Crime</name> against <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and I shall not stop to expose the conspiracy beyond.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3833"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, men are wisely presumed to intend the natural consequences of their conduct, and to seek what their acts seem to promote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3834"/>Now the <rs>Nebraska Bill</rs>, on its very face, openly clears the way for Slavery, and it is not wrong to presume that its originators intended the natural consequences of such an act, and sought in this way to extend Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3835"/>Of course they did. And this is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stage in the <name>Crime</name> against <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.</p></quote></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3836"/>This was speedily followed by other developments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>It was soon whispered that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> must be a Slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>In conformity with this barefaced scheme was the <rs>Government</rs> of this unhappy Territory organized in all its departments; and thus did the <rs>President</rs>, by whose complicity the <name>Prohibition</name> of Slavery was overthrown, lend himself to a new complicity,&mdash;giving to the conspirators a lease of connivance, amounting even to copartnership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>The Governor, <rs type="role" n="Secretary">Secretary</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief-Justice</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Associate-Justice">Associate Justices</rs>, Attorney, and <rs type="role2">Marshal</rs>, with a whole caucus of other stipendiaries, nominated by the <rs>President</rs> and confirmed by the <name>Senate</name>, are all commended as friendly to Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>No man with the sentiments of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> or <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0184.0093.00272.00830" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> or <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName> finds favor; nor is it too much to say, that, had these great patriots once more come among us, not <num value="1">one</num> of them, with his recorded, unretracted opinions on Slavery, could be nominated by the <rs>President</rs> or confirmed by the <name>Senate</name> for any post in that Territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>With such auspices the conspiracy proceeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>Even in advance of the <rs>Nebraska Bill</rs>, secret societies were organized in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, ostensibly to protect her institutions, and afterwards, under the name of <q direct="unspecified">Self-Defensive Associations</q> and <q direct="unspecified">Blue Lodges,</q> these were multiplied throughout the western counties of that State, <hi rend="italics">before any counter movement of the <rs>North</rs></hi>. It was confidently anticipated, that, by the activity of these societies, and the interest of slaveholders everywhere, with the advantage derived from the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and the influence of the <rs>Territorial Government</rs>, Slavery might be introduced into <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, quietly, but surely, without arousing conflict,&mdash; <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> that the crocodile egg might be stealthily dropped in the sunburnt soil, there to be hatched, unobserved until it sent forth its reptile monster.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>But the conspiracy was unexpectedly balked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>The debate, which convulsed Congress, stirred the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>From all sides attention was directed upon <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, which at once became the favorite goal of emigration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>The bill loudly declares that its object is <q direct="unspecified">to leave the people perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way</q>; and its supporters everywhere challenge the determination of the question between Freedom and Slavery by a competition of emigration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>Thus, while opening the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> to Slavery, the bill also opens it to emigrants from every quarter, who may by votes redress the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>The populous <rs>North</rs>, stung by sense of outrage, and inspired by a noble cause, are pouring into the debatable land, and promise soon to establish a supremacy of numbers there, involving, of course, a just supremacy of Freedom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>Then was conceived the consummation of the <name>Crime</name> against <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>What could not be accomplished peaceably was to be accomplished forcibly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>The reptile monster, that could not be quietly and securely hatched there, is to be pushed full-grown into the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>All efforts are now applied to the dismal work of forcing Slavery upon Free Soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>In flagrant derogation of the very Popular Sovereignty whose name helped to impose this bill upon the country, the atrocious object is distinctly avowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/>And the avowal is followed by the act. Slavery is forcibly introduced into <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and placed under formal safeguard of pretended law. How this is done belongs to the argument.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>In depicting this consummation, the simplest outline, without <num value="1">one</num> word of color, will be best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>Whether regarded in mass or detail, in origin or result, it is all blackness, illumined by nothing from itself, but only by the heroism of the undaunted men and women whom it environed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>A plain statement of facts is a picture of direst truth, which faithful History will preserve in its darkest gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/>In the foreground all will recognize a familiar character, in himself connecting link between <rs type="role2">President</rs> and border ruffian,&mdash;less conspicuous for ability than for the exalted place he has occupied,&mdash;who once sat in the seat where you now sit, Sir,&mdash;where once sat <persName n="Adams,,John,,," id="n0184.0093.00273.00831" reg="default:Adams,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n0184.0093.00273.00832" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, &mdash;also, where once sat <persName n="Burr,,Aaron,,," id="n0184.0093.00273.00833" reg="default:Burr,Aaron,,,"><foreName>Aaron</foreName> <surname>Burr</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3859"/>I need not add the name of <persName n="Atchison,,David,R.,," id="n0184.0093.00273.00834" reg="default:Atchison,David,R.,,"><foreName>David</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Atchison</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3860"/>You do not forget, that, at the session of Congress immediately succeeding the <rs>Nebraska Bill</rs>, he came tardily to his duty here, and then, after a short time, disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3861"/>The secret was long since disclosed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3862"/>Like Catiline, he stalked into this Chamber, reeking <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> with conspiracy,&mdash; <hi rend="italics">immo etiam in Senatum venit</hi>,&mdash;and then, like Catiline, he skulked away,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">abiit, excessit, evasit, erupit</hi>,&mdash;to join and provoke the conspirators, who at a distance awaited their congenial chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3863"/>Under the influence of his malign presence the <name>Crime</name> ripened to its fatal fruits, while the similitude with Catiline is again renewed in the sympathy, not even concealed, which he finds in the very Senate itself, where, beyond even the <rs>Roman</rs> example, a Senator has not hesitated to appear as his own compurgator.</p></quote></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3865"/>The evidence is secondary, but it is the best which, in the nature of the case, can be had; and it is not less clear, direct, and peremptory than any by which we are assured of the campaigns in the <name>Crimea</name> or the fall of <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2650582">Sebastopol</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>Before leaving this picture, where the dismal colors all come from official sources, there are <num value="2">two</num> other aspects in which Slavery may be regarded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/><num value="1">1</num>. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is its influence on <hi rend="italics">emigration</hi>. The official compendium of the census (<ref n="page 115">page 115</ref>) tells us that inhabitants of Slave States who are natives of Free States are more numerous than inhabitants <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> of Free States who are natives of Slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>This is an egregious error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>Just the contrary is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>The census of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> found <num value="606139">606,139</num> in the <rs>Free States</rs> who were born in the <rs>Slave States</rs>, while only <num value="206624">206,624</num> born in the <rs>Free States</rs> were in the <rs>Slave States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>And since the white population of the <rs>Free States</rs> is double that of the <rs>Slave States</rs>, it appears that the proportion of whites moving from Slavery is <num value="6">six</num> times greater than that of whites moving into Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>This simple fact discloses something of the aversion to Slavery which is aroused even in the <rs>Slave States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/><num value="2">2</num>. The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is furnished by the character of the region on the border-line between Freedom and Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>In general, the value of land in Slave States adjoining Freedom is advanced, while the value of corresponding lands in Free States is diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>The effects of Freedom and Slavery are reciprocal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>Slavery is a bad neighbor; Freedom is a good neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, lands naturally poor are, by nearness to Freedom, worth <measure n="12.98dollars" type="currency">$12.98</measure> an acre, while richer lands in other parts of the <rs>State</rs> are worth only <measure n="8.42dollars" type="currency">$8.42</measure>. In <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 12" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName>, lands bordering on Slavery are worth only <measure n="4.54dollars" type="currency">$4.54</measure> an acre, while other lands in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> are worth <measure n="8.05dollars" type="currency">$8.05</measure>. As in the value of lands, so in all other influences is Slavery felt for evil, and Freedom felt for good; and thus is it clearly shown to be for the interest of the <rs>Slave States</rs> to be surrounded by a circle of Free States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>At every point is the character of Slavery more and more manifest, rising and dilating into an overshadowing Barbarism, darkening the whole land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>Through its influence, population, values of all kinds, manufactures, commerce, railroads, canals, charities, the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, colleges, professional schools, academies, public schools, newspapers, periodicals, books, authorship, inventions, are all stunted, and, under a Government which professes to be founded on the intelligence of the people, <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="5">five</num> of native white adults in the region of Slavery is officially reported as unable to read and write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>In this each spoke with prophetic voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>Though on different sides of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> and on different continents, our Slave States and the original Barbary States occupy nearly the same parallels of latitude, occupy nearly the same extent of longitude, embrace nearly the same number of square miles, enjoy kindred advantages of climate, being equally removed from the cold of the <rs>North</rs> and the burning heat of the tropics, and also have similar boundaries of land and water, affording kindred advantages of ocean and sea, with this difference, that the boundaries of the <num value="2">two</num> regions are precisely reversed, so that where is land in <num value="1">one</num> is water in the other, while in both there is the same extent of ocean and the same extent of sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>There are no <num value="2">two</num> spaces on the surface of the globe, equal in extent (and careful examination will verify what I am about to state), which present so many distinctive features of resemblance, whether we consider the common regions of latitude in which they lie, the common nature of their boundaries, their common productions, their common climate, or the common Barbarism which sought shelter in both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>The barbarous <rs>Emperor</rs> of Morocco, in the words of a treaty, so long ago as the last century, declared his desire that <q direct="unspecified">the odious name of Slavery might be effaced from the memory of men;</q> while <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7000630" n="1.000 3" reg="tarabulus,tarabulus,libiya,africa">Tripoli</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000205" n="1.000 5" reg="tunisia">Tunis</placeName>, whose tenacity for the <name>Barbarism</name> was equalled only by that of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, have renounced it <num value="1">one</num> after another, and delivered it over to the indignation of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>Following this example, the parallel will be complete, and our <persName n="Barbary,,,,," id="n0184.0146.00340.00990" reg="mostcommon:Barbary,nomatch:0"><surname>Barbary</surname></persName> will become the complement in Freedom to the <rs>African Barbary</rs>, as it has already been its complement in Slavery, and is unquestionably its complement in geographical character.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5685"/>In this course I am sustained by the views of all the more intelligent among them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5686"/>In drafting them I was actuated by several motives,&mdash;the controlling <num value="1">one</num> being that I regarded their service as a military necessity if this war is to be ended in a triumph of the <rs>Union</rs> arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5687"/>Subordinate to this consideration, I regard the strict discipline of military life as the best school in which this people can be gradually lifted toward our higher civilization; and their enrolment in the negro brigade will have the further good effect of rendering mere servile insurrection, unrestrained by the laws and usages of war, less likely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5688"/>If any further argument were needed to justify my course, it would be found in my deep conviction that freedom (like all other blessings) can never be justly appreciated except by men who have been taught the sacrifices which are its price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5690"/>The superiority of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> troops has been completely demonstrated in several important respects.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5693"/><num value="3">3</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5694"/>Finally, they fight not only for freedom and all the blessings it brings, but to escape the ignominious and dreadful death they must endure if they once more fall into the hands of their revengeful task-masters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5695"/>But other considerations of the gravest magnitude, must enter into the general estimate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5696"/>Whenever or however this war may end, nobody supposes it will leave us without a military and naval force strong enough to protect ourselves against insurrection at home, and aggression or insult from abroad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5697"/>Our standing army might ultimately be made up chiefly of emancipated negroes; and so may our navy; and they would in time make such a military and maritime force as never has been seen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5698"/>Since the days of slavery are numbered in the rebel States, where the institution falls with the fall of the rebellion, and in the border States, where the people, under an enlightened policy, are abolishing it themselves, it may require a vast armed force to enable the <rs>Government</rs> to carry out such mighty changes as will necessarily attend the reconstruction of Southern society.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5714"/>The North-west cheerfully pays her proportion for the defence of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, and will pay further large appropriations now required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5715"/>But we ask, in justice, that the <rs>Northern</rs> frontier should be secured.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5844"/></p> 
<p>He went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5845"/>He had followed the standard of the <rs>Republic</rs> into every battle-field where the struggle carried him, till, worn out, but not wounded, he was borne to this hospital in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, a sick boy. He seemed to have a charmed life, for on several occasions his comrades had been shot dead or wounded on either side; and when his last cartridge had done execution, he carried off <num value="2">two</num> of his wounded companions <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> from the field, bearing them and their muskets to the rear,&mdash;if there were a rear in the flight from the <rs type="place">Bull Run</rs> of <dateStruct value="1861-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>,&mdash;and nourished and watched and stood by these comrades till they died, and then got the help of a farmer to carry them with his cart, a whole day afterward, to be buried in a place which he chose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5846"/>This boy's example had inspired that farmer with such benevolence &mdash;if he were not inspired by patriotism already&mdash;that he made honored graves for them; and the writer of this work <hi rend="italics">knows</hi> where their ashes rest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5847"/>When this was all over, the boy came back, as a kind of <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName>, of <num value="1">one</num>, in the flight of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, and, having reached the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and reported himself to his commander, fell senseless on <address><street n="Pennsylvania Avenue">Pennsylvania Avenue</street></address>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5848"/>But this was only his life as a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5849"/>There was another and a deeper life than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5850"/>The great loadstone that led him away was the magnet of his nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5851"/>Another loadstone held his heart at home: it was the magnet of Love.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5852"/>His wild and wayward history&mdash;wild only with adventure and wayward only with romance, he seemed to me, as I looked upon his face, so calm, and chiselled into sculptured beauty, I thought, either he looked like an Apollino with his unstrung bow, or a nautilus, cast on the turbulent ocean, to be wafted to some unknown clime, or sink forever, on the floor of the deep sea, to find a coral sepulchre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5853"/>His dark eyelashes&mdash;bent up in such clear relief against their white ground&mdash;slowly and calmly began to <hi rend="italics">move</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5854"/>I sprang to my feet; for it seemed to me there was a chance yet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5855"/>The surgeon was long in coming; and yet I knew he would come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5856"/>He <hi rend="italics">did</hi>. His sharp and experienced eye, as he approached the cot, opened with surprise.

<p>So, while he went through some other wards, I watched the patient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5865"/>The last glimmer of life, which had given some light as this scene was being enacted, faded into what seemed to me the calmest repose of death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5866"/>But then, I thought, it is a strange sight, a heart filled with the earnest passions of youth, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hopes of life budding into their fruition beneath his own primeval forest-shades, where, if there be an element that ever sanctified an early life, it would have built a sanctuary &mdash;for the love he must have borne to the fair being for whom he had treasured up his boyhood's jewels, for whom he gave up everything of the earth earthy, to rescue a Republic, and then go back after this episode of suffering to inaugurate the life of a citizen farmer on the bleak hills of New York:&mdash;if all this could not sustain him, what could?&mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5867"/>In former visits to him he had made me his confidant in regard to these matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5868"/>He seemed to be <hi rend="italics">haunted</hi> with the idea that he would, after all, return to <placeName reg="Utica, Oneida, New York" key="tgn,7014679">Utica</placeName>, and once more see those he loved; and yet he also seemed to me like <num value="1">one</num> whose days were numbered, and the surgeon had told me, after repeated counsels with his professional brethren, that it was next to impossible to save his life, and that I must not expect it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5869"/>All the while I clung to the belief that some vitality of faith, or love, or hope, or patriotism, or divine aid, would still send that boy back to the banks of the <placeName reg="Mohawk, New York, United States" key="tgn,1127261">Mohawk</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5870"/>I saw another nervous twitch around the temples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5873"/>The surgeon came by again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5874"/><q direct="unspecified">That boy has wonderful vitality,</q> he said, as he looked at his face.

<p>The transition from death to life seemed like enchantment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5880"/>I could scarcely believe my senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5884"/>I was bending over him to see if he would remember me. Looking me steadily in the eyes, his brows knit with perplexity for a few seconds, when with a smile of delight and surprise he said, <q direct="unspecified">Yes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5887"/></p> 
<p>I told him enough to let him understand how ill he had been,&mdash;how long,&mdash;and how weak he still was. He did not realize it. His eyes wandered down to his thin hands, white as alabaster, and through which the pale-blue thread-like veins wandered.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5888"/><q direct="unspecified">Oh! Is it I?&mdash;so lean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5889"/>I was not so when I fell sick.</q>&mdash;And large tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5891"/>But he grew impatient the more I tried to soothe and restrain him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6807"/>Our want in this respect not only extends to general education, and experience such as fit the man to adorn the society of his fellows, but to that special education and experience required to enable us to enter successfully the departments of a diversified industry.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6810"/>In order to secure the promotion of our industrial interests, you can render us assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6811"/>It is true we have no demands to make of the national government in this respect; but it is in the power of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to aid us materially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6823"/>Dear Sir: I am glad that our colored fellow-citizens are to have a convention of their own. So long as they are excluded from rights, or <pb id="p.511" n="511"/> suffer in any way, on account of color, they will naturally meet together in order to find a proper remedy, and, since you kindly invite me to communicate with the convention, I make bold to offer a few brief suggestions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6824"/>In the first place, you must at all times insist upon your rights, and here I mean not only those already accorded, but others still denied, all of which are contained in equality before the law. Wherever the law supplies a rule, there you must insist upon equal rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6825"/>How much remains to be obtained, you know too well in the experience of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6826"/>Can a respectable colored citizen travel on steamboats or railways, or public conveyances generally, without insult on account of color?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6827"/>Let <persName n="Dunn,Lieutenant-Governor,,,," id="n0184.0257.00511.01524" reg="mostcommon:Dunn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Governor">Lieutenant-Governor</roleName> <surname>Dunn</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, describe his journey from New Orleans to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6828"/>Shut out from proper accommodations in the cars, the doors of the <rs type="place">Senate Chamber</rs> opened to him, and there he found the equality which a railroad conductor had denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6829"/>Let our excellent friend, <persName n="Douglass,,Frederick,,," id="n0184.0257.00511.01525" reg="default:Douglass,Frederick,,,"><foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Douglass</surname></persName>, relate his melancholy experience, when, within sight of the <rs>Executive Mansion</rs>, he was thrust back from the dinner-table where his brother commissioners were already seated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6830"/>You know the outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6831"/>I might ask the same question in regard to hotels, or even common schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6832"/>An hotel is a legal institution, and so is a common school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6833"/>As such, each must be for the equal benefit of all. Now, can there be any exclusion from either on account of color?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6834"/>It is not enough to provide separate accommodations for colored citizens, even if in all respects as good as those of other persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6835"/>Equality is not found in an equivalent, but only in equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6836"/>In other words, there must be no discrimination on account of color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6837"/>The discrimination is an insult and a hindrance, and a bar, which not only always destroys comfort and prevents equality, but weakens all other rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6838"/>The right to vote will have new security when your equal right in public conveyances, hotels, and common schools, is at last established; but here you must insist for yourselves, by speech, by petition, and by vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6839"/>Help yourselves, and others will help you also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6840"/>The Civil Rights law needs a supplement to cover such cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6841"/>This defect has been apparent from the beginning, and, for a long time, I have striven to remove it. I have a bill for this purpose now pending in the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6842"/>Will not my colored fellow-citizens see that those in power shall no longer postpone this essential safeguard?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6843"/>Surely, here is an object worthy of effort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6844"/>Nor has the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> done its work until this is established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6845"/><pb id="p.512" n="512"/> Is it not better to establish all our own people in the enjoyment of equal rights before we seek to bring others within the sphere of our institutions, to be treated as <persName n="Douglass,,Frederick,,," id="n0184.0257.00512.01526" reg="default:Douglass,Frederick,,,"><foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Douglass</surname></persName> was on his way to the <rs>President</rs> from <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6846"/>It is easy to see that a small part of the means, the energy and the determined will spent in the expedition to <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>, and in the prolonged war-dance about that island, with menace to the black Republic of Hayti, would have secured all our colored fellow-citizens in the enjoyment of equal rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6847"/>Of this there can be no doubt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6848"/>Among the cardinal objects in education which must be insisted on must be equality, side by side with the alphabet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6849"/>It is vain to teach equality, if you do not practise it. It is vain to recite the great words of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, if you do not make them a living reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6850"/>What is lesson without example?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6851"/>As all are equal at the ballot-box, so must all be equal at the common school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6852"/>Equality in the common school is the preparation for equality at the ballot-box; therefore do I put this among the essentials of education.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6853"/>In asserting your own rights you will not fail to insist upon justice to all, under which is necessarily included purity in the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6854"/>Thieves and money-changers, whether Democrats or Republicans, must be driven out of our temple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6855"/><placeName reg="Tammany Hall">Tammany Hall</placeName> and the <rs>Republican</rs> self-seekers must be overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6858"/>Let them, while uniting against corruption, insist upon equal rights for all, and also the suppression of lawless violence, wherever it shows itself, whether in the Ku-klux Klan outraging the <rs>South</rs>, or illicit undertakings outraging the black Republic of Hayti.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6859"/>To these inestimable objects, add specie payments, and you have a platform which ought to be accepted by the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6860"/>Will not our colored fellow-citizens begin this good work?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6861"/>Let them at the same time save themselves and save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6862"/>These are the only hints which I submit to the convention, hoping that its proceedings will tend especially to the good wishes of the colored race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6871"/>my Dear Sir: In reply to your inquiry, I make haste to say that, in my judgment, the <rs>Colored Convention</rs> should think more of principles than of men, except so far as men may stand for principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6873"/>It is absurd for anybody to say that he <q direct="unspecified">accepts the situation,</q> and then deny the equal rights of the colored man. If the <q direct="unspecified">situation</q> is accepted in good faith, it must be entirely, including not merely the abolition of slavery and the establishment of equal suffrage, but also all those other rights which are still denied and abridged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6874"/>There must be complete equality before the law, so that in all institutions, agencies or conveniences, erected or regulated by law, there can be no discrimination on account of color, but a black man shall be treated as a white man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6875"/>In maintaining their rights, it will be proper for the convention to invoke the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, so that its principles and <pb id="p.514" n="514"/> promises shall become a living reality, never to be questioned in any way, but recognized always as a guide of conduct, and a governing rule in the interpretation of the national Constitution, being in the nature of a <rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">bill of rights</rs>, preceding the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6876"/>It is not enough to proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6877"/>Equality must be proclaimed also, and as, since both are promised by the great declaration, which is a national act, and as from their nature they should be uniform throughout the country, both must be placed under the safeguard of national law. There can be but <num value="1">one</num> liberty and <num value="1">one</num> equality, the same in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and New Orleans, the same everywhere throughout the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6878"/>The colored people are not ungenerous, and therefore will incline to any measures of good &mdash; will and reconciliation; but I trust no excess of benevolence will make them consent to any postponement of those equal rights which are now denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7493"/>He was a tall, handsome, strongly built man; but the injuries he then received laid him on a bed of sickness for years, causing him intense suffering, ultimately sending him to his grave at an age when a period of usefulness might still be looked for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7495"/>It is because we now more fully comprehend the magnitude of the contest and the difficulties of the position in the struggle of the statesman against the <q direct="unspecified">politicians,</q> that we are able to appreciate the force of what the <rs>Senator</rs> then said; and we may add, that we deplore the loss of the great leader in the cause of reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7496"/>The <rs>Senator</rs> has passed away at the climax, leaving the conduct of the war to other, though, we fear, less efficient hands, but not till the great utility of his life had been impaired through his failing health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7497"/>He leaves, however, a record, not only as an example to the young, but to inspire those bent on carrying on the war against the political system which has bred such corruption, to a successful issue; a reputation unblemished in an atmosphere of intrigue; pure, where political purity is rare; ever surrounded by strong temptations, wielding, as he did, a power greater than has perhaps yet been wielded on the continent of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7503"/>The time has not come for doing full justice to the great career and the great character so faintly outlined in the preceding sketch.

He was primarily a scholar, constrained by prophetic moral impulses into the field of politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7505"/>In encyclopediac knowledge none of our statesmen are to be compared with him, unless it may have been <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n0184.0275.00557.01875" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7506"/>In philosophical tendencies he somewhat resembled <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0184.0275.00557.01876" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, while he revealed an earnestness, breadth and fervor in his humane sympathies which were as much superior to <placeName reg="Jefferson City, Cole, Missouri" key="tgn,7013811">Jefferson</placeName>'s as his eloquence was greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7507"/>He was not a great debater, on account, partly, of the scholastic character of his mind, and because he had a peculiar conception of the sphere of a Senator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7508"/>He once said: <q direct="unspecified">A seat here in the <name>Senate</name> is a lofty pulpit with a mighty sounding-board, and the whole wide-spread people is the congregation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7509"/>Whenever he arose, therefore, to speak, it was not merely to discuss the legislative question in hand and to address the little circle of <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> around him; he was to expound in their fullness the large relations and suggestions of the topic for the benefit of the press and the whole American nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7510"/>His speeches were treatises winged with oratory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7511"/>There is nothing like them in the records of our national eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7512"/>They are wanting in the massive simplicity, the conciseness and severe taste of <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0184.0275.00557.01877" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s speeches; their profusion of historic allusions and quotations would seem artificial, but for its being the natural expression of the author's mind, and it is doubtful if the peculiarity will give pleasure to another generation of readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7513"/>But the force of reasoning, the broad energy of purpose, sweeping along like the <rs>Mississippi</rs>&mdash;like that, too, showing its power in its crevasses as well as in its legitimate channel&mdash;and the soul of moral heroism which illumines every sentence, will never want for admirers; what is better, will never cease to disseminate good influences and to bear good fruit among mankind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7514"/>This moral heroism, indeed, constitutes the crowning distinction of <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0184.0275.00557.01878" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, and gives him his title to immortal fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7515"/>It shone about his whole working life as a public servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7516"/>Throughout his checkered career no enemy&mdash;and none had bitterer than he&mdash;was ever found bold enough to connect his name with any jobbery or interested scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7517"/>His integrity was more than <persName n="Roman,,,,," id="n0184.0275.00557.01879" reg="mostcommon:Roman,nomatch:0"><surname>Roman</surname></persName>, it was <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0184.0275.00557.01880" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7518"/>So, too, this heroism was seen in its triumphing over the adverse influences of his training and in its transformation of his own character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7519"/>He was not democratic in his personal sympathies, while the associations of his early life were limiting if not aristocratic in their tendencies; and no <num value="1">one</num> from thence could have predicted that here was to be the <pb id="p.558" n="558"/> champion of equality, the apostle of deliverance to the poor and despised of another race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7520"/>But the principle that was in him took him up with the devotion of a Luther and the zeal of a Loyola.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7521"/>All men became alike in his eyes&mdash;alike entitled to justice, to the protection and the immunities of the law. In pursuit of this object he feared nothing on earth and he spared nothing that stood in his way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7557"/>As to the inferences to be drawn from them, there are many who will disagree with <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0278.00562.01897" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> as to the share of responsibility which should rest upon the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> for the course pursued by the <name>Administration</name> towards <persName n="Motley,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0278.00562.01898" reg="nearbymention:Motley,John,Lothrop,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Motley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7558"/>It is probable that the <rs>Senator</rs> may have revised his own judgment at a later day, as it is certain that he gave his hearty support and approval to the course of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> in reference to the seizure of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Virginius,,,,," id="n0184.0278.00562.01899" reg="mostcommon:Virginius,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginius</surname></persName></hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7559"/>The chief discredit, however, as we have said before, falls upon the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7560"/>Their most valuable and distinguished member opposed, in a frank and open manner, with his usual energy, but with his usual courtesy also, a plan of the <rs>President</rs> to acquire, by unconstitutional means, a neighboring island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7578"/>In overcoming this reluctance I am aided by <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> who are determined to make me speak.

On still another occasion, appearing still as prosecuting officer, the same <rs>Senator</rs> volunteered out of his own invention to denounce me as leaving the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>; and this he did, with infinite personality of language and manner, in the very face of my speech&mdash;to which he was replying&mdash;where, in positive words, I declare that I speak <q direct="unspecified">for the sake of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>,</q> which I hope to save from responsibility for wrongful acts, and then, in other words, making the whole assumption of the <rs>Senator</rs> an impossibility, I announce, that in speaking for the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> it is <q direct="unspecified">because from the beginning I have been the faithful servant of that party, and aspire to see it strong and triumphant.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7587"/>It is alleged that I have no personal relations with the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7588"/>Here the answer is easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7589"/>I have precisely the relations which he has chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7591"/>What he meant I never understood, nor would I attribute to him more than he meant; but that he used the language reported I have no doubt, from information independent of the newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7592"/>I repeat that on this point I have no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7593"/>The same newspapers reported also, that a member of the <rs>President</rs>'s household, enjoying his peculiar confidence, taking great part in the <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">Santo Domingo</placeName> scheme, had menaced me with personal violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7594"/>I could not believe the story except on positive, unequivocal testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7595"/>That the menace was made on the condition of his not being an army officer, I do not doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7596"/>The member of the household when interrogated by my excellent colleague (<persName n="Wilson,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00565.01914" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>) positively denied the menace, but I am assured, on authority above question, that he has since acknowledged it, while the <rs>President</rs> still retains him in service, and sends him to this Chamber.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7597"/>During this last session, I have opposed the <name>Presidential</name> policy on an important question; but always without <num value="1">one</num> word touching motives, or <num value="1">one</num> suggestion of corruption on his part, although I never doubted that there were actors in the business who could claim no such immunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7599"/>I always insisted that the <rs>President</rs> was no party to any such transaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7600"/>I should do injustice to my own feelings if I did not here declare my regret that I could not agree with the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7601"/>I tried to think as he did, but I could not. I listened to the arguments on his side; but in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7602"/>The adverse considerations multiplied with time and reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7603"/>To those who know the motives of my life, it is superfluous for me to add that I sought simply the good of my country <pb id="p.566" n="566"/> and Humanity, including especially the good of the <name>African</name> race, to which our country owes so much.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7604"/>Already there was anger at the <placeName key="tgn,7014664;tgn,2115169;tgn,2115031;tgn,2113715;tgn,2110221" n="0.065 000000.3273	placename;tgn,7014664;Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia,New Kent,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.065 000000.3273	placename;tgn,2115169;Yorktown, York, Virginia,York,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.065 000000.3273	placename;tgn,2115031;White House, Mecklenburg, Virginia,Mecklenburg,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.065 000000.3273	placename;tgn,2113715;Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia,Rockingham,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.065 000000.3273	placename;tgn,2110221;Aarons Creek, Halifax, Virginia,Halifax,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia,New Kent,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Yorktown, York, Virginia,York,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;White House, Mecklenburg, Virginia,Mecklenburg,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia,Rockingham,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Aarons Creek, Halifax, Virginia,Halifax,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">White House</placeName> when the scheme to buy and annex half an island in the <placeName reg="Caribbean Sea" key="tgn,7004569">Caribbean Sea</placeName> was pressed upon the <name>Senate</name> in legislative session, under the guise of appointing a Commission, and it became my duty to expose it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7605"/>What I said was in open debate, where the record will speak for me. I hand it over to the most careful scrutiny, knowing that the <rs>President</rs> can take no just exception to it, unless he insists upon limiting proper debate, and boldly denies the right of a Senator to express himself freely on great acts of wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7606"/>Nor will any Republican <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> admit that the <rs>President</rs> can impose his own sole will upon the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7607"/>Our party is in itself a Republic with universal suffrage, and until a measure is adopted by the party, no Republican <rs type="role2">President</rs> can make it a party test.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7617"/>For some time he showed a sympathy with the scheme almost as little as my own. But as the <rs>President</rs> grew in earnestness the <rs>Secretary</rs> yielded, until tardily he became its attorney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7707"/>Of the influence I know nothing; but I deny positively any <q direct="unspecified">urgency.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7708"/>I spoke with the <rs>President</rs> on this subject once casually, on the stairs of the <rs>Executive</rs> mansion, and then again in a formal interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7709"/>And here, since the effort of the <rs>Secretary</rs>, I shall frankly state what I said and how it was introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7710"/>I began by remarking that, with the permission of the <rs>President</rs>, I should venture to suggest the expediency of continuing <persName n="Marsh,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01953" reg="mostcommon:Marsh,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Marsh</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, <persName n="Morris,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01954" reg="mostcommon:Morris,Gouverneur,,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Morris</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7002473" n="1.000 10" reg="Istanbul,Istanbul,Marmara,Turkiye,Asia">Constantinople</placeName>, and <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01955" reg="mostcommon:Bancroft,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, as all these exerted a peculiar influence and did honor to our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7711"/>To this list I proposed to add <persName n="Howe,Doctor,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01956" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Samuel,G.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, believing that he, too, would do honor to our country, and also <persName n="Motley,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01957" reg="nearbymention:Motley,John,Lothrop,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Motley</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, who, I suggested, would have an influence there beyond his official position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7712"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> said that nobody should be sent to <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> who was not <q direct="unspecified">right</q> on the claims question, and he kindly explained to me what he meant by <q direct="unspecified">right.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7714"/>Such was the extent of my <q direct="unspecified">urgency;</q> nor was I much in advance of the <rs>Secretary</rs> at that time, for he showed me what was called the <q direct="unspecified">brief</q> at the <orgName n="State Department" type="department">State Department</orgName> for the <rs>English</rs> mission, with <persName n="Motley,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01959" reg="nearbymention:Motley,John,Lothrop,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Motley</surname></persName>'s name at the head of the list.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7715"/>Other allusions to myself would be cheerfully forgotten if they were not made the pretext to assail <persName n="Motley,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01960" reg="nearbymention:Motley,John,Lothrop,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Motley</surname></persName>, who is held to severe account for supposed dependence on me. If this were crime, not the <rs>Minister</rs> but the <rs>Secretary</rs> should suffer, for it is the <rs>Secretary</rs> and not the <rs>Minister</rs> who appealed to me constantly for help, often desiring me to think for him, and more than once to hold the pen for him. But forgetting his own relations with me, the <rs>Secretary</rs> turns upon <persName n="Motley,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01961" reg="nearbymention:Motley,John,Lothrop,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Motley</surname></persName>, who never asked me to think for him or to hold the pen for him. Other things the <rs>Secretary</rs> also forgot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7716"/>He forgot that the blow he dealt, whether at <persName n="Motley,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00574.01962" reg="nearbymention:Motley,John,Lothrop,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Motley</surname></persName> or myself, rudely tore the veil from the past, so far as its testimony might be needed in elucidation of the truth; <pb id="p.575" n="575"/> that the document he signed was a challenge and provocation to meet him on the facts, without reserve or concealment; that the wantonness of assault on <persName n="Motley,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00575.01963" reg="nearbymention:Motley,John,Lothrop,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Motley</surname></persName> was so closely associated with that on me, that any explanation that I might make must be a defence of him; that even if duty to the <name>Senate</name> and myself did not require this explanation, there are other duties not to be disregarded, among which is duty to the absent, who cannot be permitted to suffer unjustly&mdash;duty to a much-injured citizen of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, who may properly look to a Senator of his State for protection against official wrong&mdash;duty also to a public servant insulted beyond precedent, who besides writing and speaking most effectively for the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> and for this Administration, has added to the renown of our country by unsurpassed success in literature, commending him to the gratitude and good will of all. These things the <rs>Secretary</rs> strangely forgot when he dealt a blow which tore the vail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7717"/>The crime of the <rs>Minister</rs> was dependence on me. So says the <rs>State</rs> paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7718"/>A simple narrative will show who is the criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7719"/>My early relations with the <rs>Secretary</rs> have already appeared, and how he began by asking me for help, practising constantly on this appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7720"/>A few details will be enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7721"/>At once on his arrival to assume his new duties he asked my counsel about appointing <persName n="Davis,Mister,Bancroft,,," id="n0184.0279.00575.01964" reg="default:Davis,Bancroft,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Bancroft</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of State">Assistant Secretary of State</rs>, and I advised the appointment, without sufficient knowledge I am inclined to believe now. Then followed the questions with <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 5" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> growing out of <placeName key="tgn,7005380;tgn,2068750;tgn,2058490" n="0.012 000000.7688	placename;tgn,7005380;cuba,Cuba,North and Central America;0.006 000000.4092	placename;tgn,2068750;cuba, allegany, new york,Allegany,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.002 000000.1364	placename;tgn,2058490;Cuba, Crawford, Missouri,Crawford,Missouri,United States,North and Central America" reg="cuba,Cuba,North and Central America;cuba, allegany, new york,Allegany,New York,United States,North and Central America;Cuba, Crawford, Missouri,Crawford,Missouri,United States,North and Central America">Cuba</placeName>, which were the subject of constant conference, where he sought me repeatedly and kindly listened to my opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7722"/>Then came the instructions for the <rs>English</rs> mission known as the dispatch of <dateStruct value="1869-05-16"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="16">16</day>, <year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7723"/>At each stage of these instructions I was in the counsels of the <rs>Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7724"/>Following my suggestion he authorized me to invite <persName n="Motley,Mister,,,," id="n0184.0279.00575.01965" reg="nearbymention:Motley,John,Lothrop,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Motley</surname></persName> in his name to prepare the <q direct="unspecified">memoir</q> or essay on our claims, which, notwithstanding its entirely confidential character, he drags before the world, for the purpose of assault, in a manner clearly unjustifiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7725"/>Then, as the dispatch was preparing, he asked my help especially in that part relating to the concession of belligerent rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7726"/>I have here the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> draft of this important passage in pencil and in my own handwriting, varying in no essential respect from that adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7727"/>Here will be found the distinction on which I have always insisted, that while other Powers conceded belligerent rights to our rebels, it was in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> only that the concession was supplemented by acts causing direct damage to the <rs>United</rs> <pb id="p.576" n="576"/> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7728"/>Not long afterward, in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>. <dateStruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct>, when the <rs>British</rs> storm had subsided, I advised that the discussion should be renewed by an elaborate communication, setting forth our case in length and breadth, but without any estimate of damages, throwing upon <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the opportunity, if not the duty, of making some practical proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7729"/>Adopting this recommendation, the <rs>Secretary</rs> invited me to write the dispatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7730"/>I thought it better that it should be done by another, and I named for this purpose an accomplished gentleman, whom I knew to be familiar with the question, and he wrote the dispatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7736"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> was right in his description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7850"/>The amount of work, of all kinds, I have done during the last few months, is amazing, as I review it.
