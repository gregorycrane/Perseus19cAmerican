<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>General: While we were hurriedly assembling by fragments, an army, weak in numbers, wanting the cohesive force of previous organization and association, the enemy, operating from his fortified base at <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110639">Bermuda Hundred</placeName>'s Neck, had destroyed much of the <orgName n="Richmond and Petersburg Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Petersburg railroad</orgName>, and occupied the main line of communication southward, and menaced its river gate (<placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>) and south-side land defences, with a formidable army and fleet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>To effect this I resumed my original formation, and directed <persName n="Hoke,General,,,," id="n0268.0002.00009.00122" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName> to send <num value="2">two</num> brigades forward along the <placeName reg="Courthouse">Courthouse</placeName> road to take the enemy in flank and establish enfilading batteries in front of the heights west of the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The formation of our line was checked by a heavy and prolonged storm of rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Meanwhile the enemy opened a severe fire, which was soon silenced by our artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Before we were ready to advance darkness approached, and upon consultation with several of my subordinate commanders, it was deemed imprudent to attack, considering the probability of serious obstacles and the proximity of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0268.0002.00009.00123" reg="mostcommon:Butler,Ben,,,:1"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s entrenched camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>I, therefore, put the army in position for the night, and sent instructions to <persName n="Whiting,,,,," id="n0268.0002.00009.00124" reg="mostcommon:Whiting,nomatch:0"><surname>Whiting</surname></persName> to join our right, at the railroad, in the morning.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>He now rests there, hemmed by our lines, which have since, from time to time, been advanced after every skirmish, and now completely cover the southern communications of the capital, thus securing <num value="1">one</num> of the principal objects of the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The more glorious results anticipated were lost by the hesitation of the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, and the premature halt of the <rs>Petersburg</rs> <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> column, before obstacles in neither case sufficient to have deterred from the execution of the movements prescribed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Too much praise cannot be bestowed on the officers and men who fought the battle of <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>, for the order and intrepidity displayed by them whenever called upon to meet the foe, regardless of his advantage in number and position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Late in the evening the column halted near <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, a little village nestling at the bottom of the hills, a simple country hamlet, that none outside, save perhaps a postmaster, ever heard of before, and yet which in <num value="1">one</num> day awoke to find itself famous, and the hills around it historic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>This tiny town was a quiet, cool, still place&mdash;like the locality where <persName n="Winkle,,Rip,,,Van" id="n0268.0003.00010.00127" reg="expanded:Winkle,Rip,,,"><foreName>Rip</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Winkle</surname></persName> lived his days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/><num value="1">One</num> could almost imagine he saw the shambling figure, followed by his dog, disappear up the far street, and from just such a casement <persName n="Gretchen,,Dame,,," id="n0268.0003.00010.00128" reg="default:Gretchen,Dame,,,"><foreName>Dame</foreName> <surname>Gretchen</surname></persName> must have fired her farewell shot at her lazy, good-for-nothing spouse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The hamlet was deserted now&mdash;more so probably than our Sweet <placeName reg="Auburn, Cayuga, New York" key="tgn,7013343">Auburn</placeName>, the loveliest village of the plain, ever was&mdash;not a soul was to be seen, the setting sun tinged the windows with its glowing rays, and made more vivid the dark background of the high hills beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The setting sun, ah, many eyes, all unconscious, looked their last <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> upon the glowing incandescence as they stood on the crest watching the bright luminary going down.</p> <lg type="pentameter"> <l>O, setting sun awhile delay,</l> <l>Linger on sea and shore,</l> <l>For <num value="1000">thousand</num> eyes now gaze on thee,</l> <l>That shall not see thee more;</l> <l>A <num value="1000">thousand</num> hearts beat proudly now,</l> <l>Whose race like thine is o'er.</l></lg> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The <dateStruct value="-09-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> found our command in a line in the rear of <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>; we are very tired with marching, exhausted with excitement, and savagely hungry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Had we been well fed, and with nothing to do, there were none who could not have lain at ease, and enjoyed the fine view&mdash;so rich and gaudy in the autumn coloring&mdash;with the fair garden country spreading out all around, looking its best in the sweet morning air. But sentiment could find no place in a man who had nothing but the memory of what he had eaten to fill his stomach, and as we felt our limp haversacks, the sole absorbing thought crossed each man's mind&mdash;where is our breakfast, or our dinner, or our supper coming from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The men began to grumble at being forced to fight on an empty stomach, and a long line of famine-drawn faces and gaunt figures sat there in the ranks, chewing straws merely to keep their jaws from rusting and stiffening entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Just at this time a cow&mdash;a foolish, innocent, confiding animal&mdash;not knowing soldiers' ways, came grazing up to our lines; a dozen bullets crashed through her skull, and a score of knives were soon at work, in an incredibly short space of time, quicker indeed than you could skin a rabbit, the hide of the female bovine was pared and cut off, and a ravenous pack of wolves could not sooner have laid bare her bones than did these hungry soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Everything was eaten, even her tail, that was but an hour ago calmly and easily switching the flies from her back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Some soldier skinned it, burnt it over the fire, and picked it clean in a few minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>There were no cooking utensils in the whole regiment, not a single skillet or frying-pan, indeed our rations of green corn and apples left us but little need for those articles, but something must be done to cook the beef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The soldier is an inventive genius, he can prepare and dress anything, even to making <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">stone soup</hi>,</q> which by the way happened thus:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>A hungry looking, lank, angular specimen of the genus <rs>Reb</rs>, appeared at the farm house of a widow lady&mdash;not far from <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, who was noted for her niggardliness and parsimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>So close indeed, <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> and mean was she, that a placard was nailed on her gate with the inscription: <q direct="unspecified">No soldiers fed or housed here.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/></p> 
<p>The best foragers and pirooters of the brigade met their match in this old woman, and returned defeated from the field, and at last she was left in undisturbed possession of her place and no hungry soldiers ever were fed at her table.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>When this animated picture and figure of famine stalked in her yard, the old lady was prepared for hostilities immediately.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The sad faced defender of the soil, asked in a humble way:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/><q direct="unspecified">Please marm, lend me your iron pot?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Man, I haven't no iron pot for you!</q>

<p><q direct="unspecified">Please marm, I wont hurt it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">You don't s'pose I am agwine to lend you my pot to carry it to camp, do you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>I would never see it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Go over there where <persName n="Hanger,Mrs.,,,," id="n0268.0003.00012.00129" reg="mostcommon:Hanger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hanger</surname></persName> lives, she will lend hers to you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Marm I will bring your pot back, hope I may die if I don't. I wont take it out of the yard and will kindle the fire here.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">What do you want with it?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>said the old lady.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/><q direct="unspecified">I want to bile some stone soup,</q> answered the soldier, looking plaintively at the questioner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/><q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Stone,,,,," id="n0268.0003.00012.00130" reg="mostcommon:Stone,Henry,L.,,:1"><surname>Stone</surname></persName> soup!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>What's stone soup?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>and the old lady's curiosity began to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/><q direct="unspecified">How do you make it, and what for?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Marm,</q> replied the sad faced infantryman, <q direct="unspecified">ever since the war began, the rations have become scarcer and scarcer, until they have stopped entirely, and we uns have to live on stone soup to keep from starving.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Stone,,,,," id="n0268.0003.00012.00131" reg="mostcommon:Stone,Henry,L.,,:1"><surname>Stone</surname></persName> soup, how do you make it?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Please marm you get a pot with some water, and I will show you. We biles the stone.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/></p> 
<p>The ancient dame trotted off, full of wonder and inquisitiveness to get the article, and by the time she returned the soldier had kindled a fire, and settling the kettle on the pile, waited for the water to boil, taking a rock about the size of his head, he washed it clean and put it in the pot, and then he said to the old woman who was peering in the pot:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/><q direct="unspecified">Marm, please get me a small piece of bacon, about the size of your hand, to gin the soup a relish.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/></p> 
<p>The old lady again toddled off and got it for him. Another <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> passed by.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/><q direct="unspecified">Is it done?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>inquired the woman.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/><q direct="unspecified">It's most done; but please marm give me <num value="0.5">a half</num> a head of cabbage <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> just to make it taste right.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The cabbage was brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/><measure n="10minutes" type="date">Ten minutes</measure> came and went.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/><q direct="unspecified">Is it done, now?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>asked the wondering daughter of Eve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/><q direct="unspecified">Mos' done; but please marm give me <num value="0.5">a half</num> a dozen potatoes, just to gin it a final flavor.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/><q direct="unspecified">All right,</q> answered the widow, who by this time had become deeply absorbed in the operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The potatoes followed the cabbage and meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Another <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> was numbered in the cycle of eternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/><q direct="unspecified">Isn't it done yet, &apos;pears to me that it's a long time a cooking,</q> remarked the antique mother, who was getting impatient.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/><q direct="unspecified">Mos' done; jest get me a handful of flour, some pepper and salt, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> termartusses, and it will be all right.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/></p> 
<p>These things were brought, and after bubbling in the pot awhile, the utensil was lifted off the fire, the soldier pulled his knife, with spoon attachment, and commenced to eat. The economical widow went in, got a plate, came out, and filled it, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> spoonful she tasted she exclaimed,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/><q direct="unspecified">Why, man, this is nothing but common vegetable soup.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">So it is, marm,</q> responded the soldier, who was making the best time he could; <q direct="unspecified">but we uns calls it stone soup.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/></p> 
<p>The old lady carried her pot in the house, learning that the ingenuity of a soldier can compass anything.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>But I will return to my mutton&mdash;or, rather, my beef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The men were not to be balked of their meal because there wasn't a cooking range or <name>French</name> cooks to prepare their dinner; they hunted about and found flat stones, that were lying around in the greatest profusion, and broiled their beef on them, and then went at it tooth and nail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>It would be an interesting study to know how much meat some of those men ate&mdash;enough, indeed, to hold his own in that line against a Pawnee or Piute Indian.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>After this <hi rend="italics">dejeuner</hi>, a squad of us went into <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The enemy's artillery had begun to play upon the village, and the many hills echoed and re-echoed the thunder, the war music so common to our ears the last <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>We stayed a short time, and on our return came down the road towards the <num value="17" type="ordinal">Seventeenth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>We were passing a group of soldiers lying behind a fence watching the flash of the enemy's artillery, which was on a high hill about a mile off. All at once a large <num value="12">twelve</num>-pounder shell from <num value="1">one</num> of these very guns struck the ground in the front, and then, as if cast by a child's hands, rolled gently around the group, and there it rested, with the fuse spluttering and blazing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>The <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> effect was ludicrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>We did not stop on the order of going, but went at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Every man jumped, hopped, ran, or rolled from that harmless-looking little black ball, and did not stop until they were at a respectable distance, when, lying flat down, they awaited the explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>It soon came, and shattered a whole panel of fence by the force of its discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>How thankful we were that the fuse was so long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Going back, we picked as best we could the fallen fruit which we forgot to carry when that shell came along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>We lost our grapes, though.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> were preparing for their battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>On the heights, some <measure n="2000yards" type="distance">two thousand yards</measure> away, fresh batteries would take their position and open; ours would reply, and so, as the hours of the forenoon wore on, the war clamor grew greater, and soon on our left the splashes of musketry, and then the steady, rattling discharges showed the battle was fairly joined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The old cry soon came to us, <q direct="unspecified">Fall in!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>and, soon in line, we advanced and took our place and waited with clenched teeth and fearless front for the attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Our position was directly in front of the village of <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, on a high hill, behind a new post and rail fence; the topography of the country and the configuration of the ground was peculiar, consisting of a succession of undulating hills and corresponding valleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The elevation that we were on sunk rather abruptly to a deep bottom, and then rose suddenly, forming another hill, the crest of which was about <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure> from the top of the eminence where we rested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Any attacking force would be invisible until they arrived on the top of the crest opposite, and in pistol-shot distance, or what we call point blank musketry range.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>On our front about a mile away was <placeName reg="Antietam Creek, United States" key="tgn,2135228">Antietam creek</placeName>, spanned by a bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>This was guarded by <orgName n="GA brigade"><persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0268.0003.00014.00132" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>'s Georgia brigade</orgName>, which was only a skeleton command, being about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of its full ranks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Our army surrounded <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName> in a semi-circle, and we could lie there and hear and see the raging frenzied battle on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The reports of the cannon were incessant and deafening: at times it seemed as if a <num value="100">hundred</num> guns would explode simultaneously, and then run off at intervals into splendid file firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>No language can describe its awful grandeur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The <num value="1000">thousand</num> continuous volleys of musketry mingle in a grand roar of a great cataract, and together merging, seemed as if the earth was being destroyed by violence, the canopy of the battle's fume, from this vast burning of gunpowder, rising above the battle-field in such thick clouds, that the <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> sun looked down gloomy red in the sky, while the dust raised by the mass of men floated to the clouds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Listen! the fight has commenced down at <placeName reg="Antietam bridge">Antietam bridge</placeName>, where <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0268.0003.00015.00133" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName> lies with his Georgians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> have commenced to shell their front, which, we all know, is but a prelude to the deadlier charge of infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The shells begin to sail over us as we lay close behind the fence, shrieking its wild song, a canzonet of carnage and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>These missiles howled like demons, and made us cower in the smallest possible space, and wish we had each a little red cap in the fairy tale, which, by putting on our heads, would make us invisible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>But what is that infernal noise that makes the bravest duck their heads?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>That is a <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Hotchkiss,,,,," id="n0268.0003.00015.00134" reg="mostcommon:Hotchkiss,Jedediah,,,:1"><surname>Hotchkiss</surname></persName></q> shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Thank goodness, it bursted far in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It is no more destructive than some other projectile, but there is a great deal in mere sound to work on men's fears, and the moral effect of the <name>Hotchkiss</name> is powerful.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The tremendous scream of this shell is caused by a ragged edge of lead which is left on the missile as it leaves the gun. In favorable positions of light the phenomenon can sometimes be seen as you stand directly behind the gun of the clinging of the air to the ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The missile seems to gather up the atmosphere and carry it along, as our globe carries its air through space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Men are frequently killed by the wind of a cannon ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>There is a law of Nature which causes the atmosphere to cling to the earth, or which presses upon it with a force on the surface of <measure n="15l." type="pounds"><num value="15">fifteen</num> pounds</measure> to the square inch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Does the same law pertain to cannon balls in their flight?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The enemy are silent, but it is the calm that is but a prefix to a hurricane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It comes suddenly and the musketry at the bridge breaks out fiercely; it rises and swells into a full compass: there is sharp work going on. In about an hour <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0268.0003.00015.00135" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> came rushing back, its lines broken, but its spirit and <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It retreated to the village and was reformed and held in reserve to us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>We made ready and expected to see the victorious <rs>Yankees</rs> following hard upon the heels of the retreating Rebels, but to our astonishment an hour or <num value="2">two</num> of absolute inaction followed; no advance nor demonstrations were made in our front, but on the left the battle was raging as fiercely as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>What could it mean, we asked each other, but none could solve the question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>At last towards evening their shelling was renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>A battery supporting the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">first brigade</orgName> replied to it. Soon came the singing of the minnies overhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>There is a peculiar tuneful pitch in the flight <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> of these little leaden balls; a musical ear can study the different tones as they skim through the space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>A comrade lying next to me, an ameteur musician of no mean merit, spoke of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Said he, <q direct="unspecified">I caught the pitch of that minnie that just passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It was a swell from E flat to F, and as it retrograded in the distance receded to D&mdash;a very pretty change.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/></p> 
<p>It was now getting late in the afternoon, and the men were becoming cramped from lying in their constrained position; some were moving up and down, some stretching themselves, for there was a cessation of firing in our front&mdash;an interval of quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It was but a short time, for the guarded, stern, nervous voice of our officer, calling, <q direct="unspecified">Quick, men, back to your posts!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>sent every soldier into line.

<p>Yes, that thin string of tattered men, lying there with their bright rifles clasped tight in their hands, had marched onward, and onward, though their gaunt frames seemed as if they would sink at every step, they had followed their colors on the hot, dusty march, with fatigue relaxing their muscles, closing their eyes and deadening their wills, they had dragged themselves along to the battle-field with stone-bruised feet; they had fought and won battles on empty stomachs; they had kept steadily on making their allotted march, famishing and nearly naked, covered with dust, half devoured by vermin; they marched onward, still onward, through all the smoke of battle, through the torrid heat of a summer's sun; they had followed their flags through all of this with cheers like the songs of gods.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>When a farewell glance of the ground was taken there was a sad sight; there rested the line of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">Seventeenth</num> just as they had fallen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The <measure n="3" type="prisoners">three prisoners</measure> were hurried to the rear, and on reaching the opposite crest found that our fire had been very destructive; each man had probably killed or wounded his man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>A frightful struggle was now going on in the woods half a mile or so to our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It appeared to us as if all the demons of hell had been unloosed&mdash;all the dogs of war unleashed to prey upon and rend each other; long volleys of musketry vomited their furious discharges of pestilential lead; the atmosphere was crowded by the exploding shells; baleful fires gleamed through the foliage, as if myriads of fireflies were flitting through the boughs, and there was a fringe of vivid, sparkling flame spurting out along the skirt of the forest, while the concussion of the cannon seemed to make the hills tremble and totter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>But a change takes place in this panorama; a marvellous change, before our very eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>What was the import of this?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>None could tell, but still the reflux tide bore us back with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Still forward came the wave of gray, still backward receeded the billows of blue, heralded by warning hiss of the bullets, the sparkling of the rifle flashes, the purplish vapor settling like a veil over the lines, the mingled hurrahs and wild yells, and the bass accompaniment over on our left of the hoarse cannonading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Back we went, stopping on top of every rise of the ground to watch the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It was nearly night, the last gleam of the sun's rays struck upon the glass windows of the houses of the little village of <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, and made them shine like fire, brighter, more vivid, than even the flames bursting from <num value="1">one</num> house that had been set on fire by an exploding shell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>At last the bridge is reached&mdash;the stone bridge that crosses <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName> creek&mdash;the key point of the <rs>Federal</rs> position, the weak point in their line, the spot so anxiously watched by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0268.0003.00020.00144" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,H.,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, for he sent repeated dispatches to <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0268.0003.00020.00145" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> late that evening, as <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n0268.0003.00020.00146" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> bore back the advancing tide&mdash;his order was: <q direct="unspecified">Hold on to the bridge at all hazards; if the bridge is lost all is lost.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>But the battle in our front ceased suddenly, though on other parts of the field it still kept up.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The ground all about the bridge was covered with the dead and wounded, for the <rs>Yankees</rs> had established a sort of field hospital here, and the desperately hurt in the immediate front were left at this <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> point.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>It is however, Sir, the duty, as it is the pleasure, of man, to look both backward and forward; and therefore, while memory plays her part to-night in recalling the past, you have directed that we should project our thoughts into the future to inquire how that Cause, which still remains dear to your hearts, shall fare at the hands of the historian.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>And there is, I will venture to say, scarcely a soldier of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who does not share this apprehension that posterity may not do justice to the cause in which he fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>And if you thought, to-night, that the muse of history would turn traitor to your cause, misrepresent the principles for which you fought, and deny to you those attributes of valour, fortitude and heroic devotion you have grandly won, your souls would rise up within you in immediate and bitter and protesting indignation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>This apprehension is thought by some to be not altogether groundless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The <rs>North</rs>, it is said, is making the literature of these times, has secured the ear of the age and will not fail to make an impression, unfavorable to you, which time will deepen rather than obliterate.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>On the <dateStruct value="-08-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, it was ascertained certainly that the <rs>Federal</rs> army from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, under <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00049.00406" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, had crossed the mountains to <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n0268.0011.00049.00407" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,Carter,L.,,:1"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Fairfield, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013453">Bridgeport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>His force of effective <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> infantry and artillery amounted to fully <num value="70000">70,000</num>, divided into <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 4">four corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>About the same time, <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00050.00408" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> advanced from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> towards <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, with a force estimated by the <rs>General</rs> commanding that department at over <num value="25000">25,000</num>.

The enemy having already obtained a lodgment in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> by another route, the continued occupation of <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName> became very hazardous to the garrison and comparitively unimportant to us. Its evacuation was accordingly ordered, but on the appeal of its commander, stating his resources and ability for defence, favorably endorsed by <persName n="Buckner,Major-General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00050.00411" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,S.,B.,,:4"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, the orders were suspended on the <dateStruct value="-08-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The main body of our army was encamped near <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, whilst the cavalry force, much reduced and enfeebled by long service on short rations, was recruiting in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome, Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Immediately after crossing the mountains to the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, the enemy threw a corps by way of <placeName reg="Sequatchie Valley, Tennessee, Tennessee" key="tgn,2652659">Sequatchie Valley</placeName> to strike the rear of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00050.00412" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,S.,B.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, whilst <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0268.0011.00050.00413" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> occupied him in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>As soon as this change was made, the corps threatening his rear was withdrawn, and the enemy commenced a movement in force against our left and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>On the last of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, it became known that he had crossed his main force over the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>, at and near <persName n="Carpenter,,,,," id="n0268.0011.00050.00415" reg="mostcommon:Carpenter,nomatch:0"><surname>Carpenter</surname></persName>'s ferry, the most accessible point from <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n0268.0011.00050.00416" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,Carter,L.,,:1"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>By a direct route he was now as near our main depot of supplies as we were, and our whole line of communication was exposed, whilst his was partially secured by mountains and the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>By the timely arrival of <num value="2">two</num> small divisions from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, our effective force, exclusive of cavalry, was now a little over <num value="35000">35,000</num>, with which it was determined to strike on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> favorable opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>Closely watched by our cavalry, which had been brought forward, it was soon ascertained that the enemy's general movement was towards our left and rear, in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2022620" n="1.000 4" reg="dalton, whitfield, georgia">Dalton</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, keeping <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout mountain</placeName> between us. The nature of the country, and the want of supplies in it, with the presence of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0268.0011.00050.00417" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s force <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> on our right, rendered a movement on the enemy's rear with our inferior force extremely hazardous, if not impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>It was, therefore, determined to meet him in front, whenever he should emerge from the mountain gorges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>To do this, and hold <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> was impossible, without such a division of our small force a to endanger both parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>The forces on the <rs>Hiawassee</rs> and at <placeName reg="Chickamauga Station, Chattanooga, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098422">Chickamauga Station</placeName>, took the route by <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>A small cavalry force was left in observation at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and a brigade of infantry, strongly supported by cavalry, was left at <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName> to hold the railroad and protect it from raids.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>As soon as our movement was known to the enemy, his corps nearest <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and which had been threatening <persName n="Buckner,,,,," id="n0268.0011.00051.00419" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,S.,B.,,:4"><surname>Buckner</surname></persName>'s rear, was thrown into that place, and shortly thereafter commenced to move on our rear by the <num value="2">two</num> roads to <placeName key="tgn,2444045" n="1.000 5" reg="lafayette, walker, georgia">Lafayette</placeName> and <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>Thrown off his guard by our rapid movement, apparently in retreat, when, in reality we had concentrated opposite his center, and deceived by the information from deserters and others sent into his lines, the enemy pressed on his columns to intercept us, and thus exposed himself in detail.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>The <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> was to await the attack by the right; take it up promptly when made, and the whole line was then to be pushed vigorously and persistently against the enemy throughout its extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Before the dawn of day, myself and staff were ready <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> for the saddle, occupying a position immediately in rear of, and accessible to all parts of the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>A reconnoissance made in the front of our extreme right, during this delay, crossed the main road to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and proved the important fact that this greatly desired position was open to our possession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>The reasons assigned for this unfortunate delay by the wing commander, appear in part in the reports of his subordinates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>It is sufficient to say they are entirely unsatisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>It also appears from these reports that when the action was opened on the right, about <time value="10am">10 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Our troops were led with the greatest gallantry, and exhibited great coolness, bravery and heroic devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>In no instance did they fail, when called on, to rally and return to the charge; but though invariably driving the enemy with great slaughter, at the points assailed, they were compelled in turn to yield to the greatly superior numbers constantly brought against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The attack on the left, promptly made as ordered, met with less resistance, much of the enemy's strength having been transferred to our right, and was successfully and vigorously followed up. About <time value="2pm">2 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Unable to afford assistance from any other part of the field, written orders were immediately dispatched to <persName n="Polk,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00060.00591" reg="mostcommon:Polk,Leonidas,,,:2"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>, to again assault the enemy in his front with his whole force, and to persist until he should dislodge him from his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>Directing the operations on our left to be continued, I <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> moved again to the right and soon dispatched a staff officer to <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00061.00592" reg="mostcommon:Polk,Leonidas,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>, urging a prompt and vigorous execution of my written orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>About <time value="4pm">4 P. M.</time>, this <orgName n="General Assault" type="misc">general assault</orgName> was made and the attack was continued from right to left, until the enemy gave way at different points and, finally, about dark, yielded us his line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>The contest was severe, but the impetuous charge of our troops could not be resisted when they were brought to bear in full force, even where the enemy possessed all the advantage of position and breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>The troops were halted, by their respective commanders, when the darkness of the night, and the density of the forest rendered further movements uncertain and dangerous, and the army bivouaced on the ground it had so gallantly won. Both flanks having advanced more rapidly than the centre, they were found confronting each other in lines nearly parallel, and within artillery range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>Any advance by them, especially at night, over ground so thickly wooded, might have resulted in the most serious consequences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>The enemy, though driven from his lines, still confronted us, and desultory firing was heard until <time value="8pm">eight P. M.</time> Other noises, indicating movements and dispositions for the morrow, continued until a late hour at night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>During the operations by the main forces, on the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> and <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num>, the cavalry, on the flanks, was actively and usefully employed, holding the enemy in observation and threatening or assailing him as occasion offered.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>Exhausted by <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> battle, with very limited supply of provisions, and almost destitute of water, some time in daylight was absolutely essential for our troops to supply these necessaries and replenish their ammunition before renewing the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Availing myself of this necessary delay to inspect and readjust my lines, I moved, as soon as daylight served, on the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="2">21st</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>On my arrival, about sunrise, near <persName n="Polk,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00061.00595" reg="mostcommon:Polk,Leonidas,,,:2"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>'s bivouac, I met the ever vigilant <persName n="Liddell,General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00061.00596" reg="mostcommon:Liddell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Liddell</surname></persName>, commanding a division in our front line, who was awaiting the <rs>General</rs> to report that his pickets this morning discovered the enemy had retreated during the night from his immediate front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>Instructions were promptly given to push forward our whole line of skirmishers to the front, and I moved to the <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> left and extended these orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>All the cavalry at hand, including my personal guard, were ordered to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>Members of my staff, in passing through the lines of our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> with their escort, were warned of danger, and told that they were entering on the neutral ground between us and the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>But this proved to be an error, and our cavalry soon came upon the enemy's <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, where the main road passes through <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary ridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>He had availed himself of the night to withdraw from our front, and his main body was already in position within his lines at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>Any immediate pursuit by our infantry and artillery would have been fruitless, as it was not deemed practicable, with our weak and exhausted forces, to assail the enemy, now more than double our numbers, behind his entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Though we had defeated him and driven him from the field with heavy loss in men, arms and artillery, it had only been done by heavy sacrifices, in repeated, persistent and most gallant assaults upon superior numbers strongly posted and protected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>The conduct of our troops was excellent throughout the prolonged contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Often repulsed where success seemed impossible, they never failed to rally and return to the charge, until the last combined and determined effort, in which the spirit of every man seemed to conspire for success, was crowned with the reward due to such gallantry in a just cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Our loss was in proportion to the prolonged and obstinate struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/><num value="2">Two</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of our gallant troops had fallen, and the number of general and staff officers stricken down will best show how these troops were led. <persName n="Hood,Major-General,,,," id="n0268.0011.00062.00597" reg="mostcommon:Hood,J.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, the model soldier and inspiring leader, fell after contributing largely to our success, and has suffered the irreparable loss of a leg.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>The <rs type="role" reg="medical-Officer">medical officers</rs>, both in the field and in the hospitals, earned the lasting gratitude of the soldier and deserve the highest commendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>The great number of wounded thrown suddenly upon their hands taxed every energy and every faculty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>With means greatly inadequate, especially in transportation, they soon reduced confusion into order, and by assiduity and skill, afforded to the gallant sufferers that temporal relief for which they might look in vain to any other source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>In this connection, it is a pleasing duty to acknowledge in grateful terms the deep indebtness of the army to the <rs type="place">Hospital</rs> Relief Associations, which so promptly and so generously pressed forward their much needed assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Under the admirable management of their officers in <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, we were soon furnished with every necessary and comfort, and stores continued to arrive until notice was given that our wants were all supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>The officers of my staff, personal and general, served me on this field and on the arduous marches preceding, with their usual zeal, intelligence and gallantry.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>The whole cavalry force having been dispatched to press the enemy and cut off detachments, orders were given for the army to move to a point near the railroad and convenient to water, still interposing between the enemy and our large number of wounded, our trophies, <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> and our wounded prisoners, whose removal from the field occupied many days.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Our supplies of all kinds were greatly reduced, the railroad having been constantly occupied in transporting troops, prisoners, and our wounded, and the bridges having been destroyed to a point <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> <offset>south</offset> of  <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>These supplies were ordered to be replenished, and as soon as it was seen that we could be subsisted, the army was moved forward to seize and hold the only communication the enemy had with his supplies in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>At the same time, our cavalry, in large force, was thrown across the river to operate on this long and difficult route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>These dispositions, faithfully sustained, ensured the enemy's speedy evacuation of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> for want of food and forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>Possessed of the shortest road to his depot, and the <num value="1">one</num> by which reinforcements must reach him, we held him at our mercy, and his destruction was only a question of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>We stood towards the <rs>Minnesota</rs> and opened fire on her. The pilots were to have placed us half-a-mile from her, but we were not at any time nearer than a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>The Monitor<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>We soon approached, and were often within a ship's length; once while passing we fired a broadside at her only a few yards distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>She and her turret appeared to be under perfect control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>Her light draft enabled her to move about us at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>She once took position for a short time where we could not bring a gun to bear on her. Another of her movements caused us great anxiety; she made for our rudder and propeller, both of which could have been easily disabled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>We could only see her guns when they were discharged; immediately afterward the turret revolved rapidly, and the guns were not again seen until they were again fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>We wondered how proper aim could be taken in the very short time the guns were in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>The Virginia, however, was a large target, and generally so near that the <rs>Monitor</rs>'s shot did not often miss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>It did not appear to us that our shell had any effect upon the <rs>Monitor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>We had no solid shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>Musketry was fired at the look-out holes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>In spite of all the care of our pilots we ran ashore, where we remained over <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>. The <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> and <rs>Jamestown</rs>, with great risk to themselves, started to our assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>The Monitor and <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName> were in full play on us. A small rifle-gun on board the <rs type="ship">Minnesota</rs>, or on the steamer alongside of her, was fired with remarkable precision.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>When we saw that our fire made no impression on the <rs>Monitor</rs>, we determined to run into her if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>We found it a very difficult feat to do. Our great length and draft, in a comparatively narrow channel, with but little water to spare, made us sluggish in our movements, and hard to steer and turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>When the opportunity presented all steam was put on; there was not, however, sufficient time to gather full headway before striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>The blow was given with the broad <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> wooden stem, the iron prow having been lost the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>The Monitor received the blow in such a manner as to weaken its effect, and the damage was to her trifling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>Shortly after an alarming leak in the bows was reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>It, however, did not long continue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>Whilst contending with the <rs>Monitor</rs>, we received the fire of the <rs>Minnesota</rs>,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/> 
<p>She was a screw steam frigate of <num value="3200">3,200</num> tons, mounting <num value="43">forty-three</num> guns of <num value="8">eight</num>, <num value="9">nine</num> and <measure n="10inch" type="distance">ten-inch</measure> calbre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>Her draft was about the same as the <rs>Virginia</rs>.</p></note> which we never failed to return whenever our guns could be brought to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>We set her on fire and did her serious injury, though much less than we then supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Generally the distance was too great for effective firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>We blew up a steamer alongside of her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>The fight had continued over <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>. To us the <rs>Monitor</rs> appeared unharmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>We were therefore surprised to see her run off into shoal water where our great draft would not permit us to follow, and where our shell could not reach her. The loss of our prow and anchor, and consumption of coal, water, &amp;c., had lightened us so that the lower part of the forward end of the shield was awash.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>We for some time awaited the return of the <rs>Monitor</rs> to the <rs type="place">Roads</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>After consultation it was decided that we should proceed to the navyyard, in order that the vessel should be brought down in the water and completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>The pilots said if we did not then leave that we could not pass the bar until <time value="12pm">noon</time> of the next day. We therefore at <time value="12mid">12 M.</time> quit the <rs type="place">Roads</rs> and stood for <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>Had there been any sign of the <rs>Monitor</rs>'s willingness to renew the contest we would have remained to fight her. We left her in the shoal water to which she had withdrawn, and which she did not leave until after we had crossed the bar on our way to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>The official report says: <q direct="unspecified">Our loss is <measure n="2" type="killed">two killed</measure> and <measure n="19" type="wounded">nineteen wounded</measure>. The stem is twisted and the ship leaks; we have lost the prow, starboard anchor, and all the boats; the armor is somewhat damaged, the steam-pipe and smoke-stack both riddled, the muzzles of <num value="2">two</num> of the guns shot away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>It was not easy to keep a flag flying; the flag-staffs were repeatedly shot away; the colors were hoisted to the smoke-stack, and several times cut down from it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>None were killed or wounded in the fight with the <rs>Monitor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>The only damage she did was to the armor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>She fired <num value="41">forty-one</num> shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>We were enabled to receive most of them obliquely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>The effect of a shot striking obliquely on the shield was to break all the iron, and sometimes <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> to displace several feet of the outside course; the wooden backing would not be broken through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>When a shot struck directly at right angles, the wood would also be broken through, but not displaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>Generally the shot were much scattered; in <num value="3">three</num> instances <num value="2">two</num> or more struck near the same place, in each case causing more of the iron to be displaced, and the wood to bulge inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>A few struck near the water-line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>The shield was never pierced; though it was evident that <num value="2">two</num> shots striking in the same place would have made a large hole through everything.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>The ship was docked; a prow of steel and wrought iron put on, and a course of <measure n="2inch" type="distance">two-inch</measure> iron on the hull below the roof extending in length <measure n="180feet" type="distance">180 feet</measure>. Want of time and material prevented its completion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>The damage to the armor was repaired; wrought-iron port-shutters were fitted, &amp;c. The rifle guns were supplied with bolts of wrought and chilled iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>The ship was brought a foot deeper in the water, making her draft <measure n="23feet" type="distance">23 feet</measure>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>The <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs> was a large brick tobacco factory, <num value="3">three</num> stories high, owned and used by the manufacturer whose name it bears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>It was opened by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities as a hotel for the reception of Federal troops, who persisted in marching <q direct="unspecified">on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,</q> after the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs>, and who, instead of being required wearily to tramp into the capital of the <q direct="unspecified">Old Dominion,</q> were generously allowed to make the journey in railway cars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> installment of Federal troops, gathered from the panicstricken field of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> (or <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>), about <num value="1000">1,000</num> in number, rather reluctantly filed into its chambers within a week after the <dateStruct value="1861-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>Some <num value="400">four hundred</num> others, wounded, were elsewhere provided for in extemporized hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>The accommodations furnished these gentlemen were not equal to those ordinarily found in a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class hotel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>They had not been expected in such numbers, and due preparation had not been made for their reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>There was not a Confederate official in the land who had any experience in taking care of prisoners of war. They were therefore necessarily subjected to many inconveniences and privations, which a suddenly improvised commissariat and superintending staff could not at once remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/><pb id="p.84" n="84"/> They slept upon the floor on their blankets, if they had been thoughtful enough to bring any, and ate their rations from their fingers, or spread them out on boxes or barrel-heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>Knives, forks and spoons were not abundantly supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>But all this was better than sleeping on the bare ground without blankets and masticating scant and course rations while on the march, as multitudes of soldiers in both armies were often compelled to do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>Something like order, however, was soon arranged, and the prisoners, by orders of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, were as well fed and better sheltered than the soldiers of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>Prisons are always uncomfortable places for subjective, if not for objective, reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>I never have happened to meet <num value="1">one</num> from either side who, while prisoner of war, was satisfied with his accommodations or victuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>It is not in human nature to be contented under physical restraints, and it is among the privileges and luxuries of prisoners to grumble; and he is a hard-hearted jailer who will attempt to deprive them of these alleviations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/><rs n="feather beds" type="product">Feather-beds</rs> are hard and tenderloin steaks are tough behind iron gratings, and the kindest and most liberal commissary never satisfied prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>No external conditions can soothe the spirit's chafings; and as these men did not have soft couches, nor juicy roasts, they had a right to croak, and they exercised it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>Among those earliest introduced into <placeName reg="Libby prison">Libby prison</placeName> was <persName n="Ely,Congressman,,,," id="n0268.0014.00084.00832" reg="mostcommon:Ely,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Congressman">Congressman</roleName> <surname>Ely</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Rochester, Monroe, New York" key="tgn,7014348">Rochester, N. Y.</placeName>, who, with other civilians, had taken a holiday excursion in carriages to witness a battle and congratulate the <rs>Federal</rs> victors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>He amused himself by writing a diary of his observations and experiences, which he afterwards published in a volume ill-natured enough to be amusing, and in which so humble a personage as myself was singled out for special censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>All that I am conscious of having done to deserve this honorable mention, was, in a good-humored way, to reply to arguments urged to convince me that the <rs>Southern States</rs> had no right to secede, and that the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> was justifiable in sending armies to suppress the insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>Of course the prisoners having little else to do, were fond of talking, and so I imagined that I was gratifying them by responding and improvising a cheerful debate to help them while away the time which hung so heavily on their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>I sometimes ventured to keep the ball rolling in a spirit of pure benevolence, perhaps just tinctured with a grain or <num value="2">two</num> of impure reconciliation with their lot. If I ever uttered an ill-natured or abusive or churlish word to a prisoner <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> I would sorrowfully repent of it if I could only remember it. It may be that occasionally I did not sufficiently allow for the irritable sensitiveness of men whose anticipations had been so suddenly and disastrously checked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>The sensitiveness put its own somber interpretation upon words which were never meant to offend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>For example, <num value="1">one</num> of the chaplains, a clergyman of my own faith, asked me if I could lend him a volume of <placeName reg="Hamilton, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112085">Hamilton</placeName>'s Logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>The next day I carried it to him, and presented it to him with the remark that it required brains to <persName><roleName n="Master">master</roleName> <foreName>Hamilton</foreName></persName>'s Philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>He published afterward in a northern paper that <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> B. had insulted him by intimating that he (the chaplain) had not brains enough to comprehend <placeName reg="Hamilton, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112085">Hamilton</placeName>'s Philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>He did not tell his readers, however, that he had accepted the volume, though tendered with so rude an insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>It was simply an irrascible interpretation of what, in another mood, he would have accepted as a compliment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>Among the <rs>Manassas</rs> prisoners were <num value="10">ten</num> field officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/><num value="1">One</num> of these was the notorious <rs>Michael Corcoran</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Colonel">Colonel</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="69NYRegiment">Sixty-ninth New York regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>He had been, as far as his known biography reports, proprietor of a drinking saloon in the <name>Bowery</name> of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, and was quite prominent among the political manipulators of the <rs type="place">Tweed school</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>He aided in enlisting a regiment of New York roughs, of which he was elected <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>He led his regiment to the field of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and thence led or followed many of his boys in a forced march <q direct="unspecified">on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>Walking through the prison <num value="1">one</num> day, in company with a gentlemanly Federal officer, he asked me if I would be introduced to <persName n="Corcoran,Colonel,,,," id="n0268.0014.00085.00833" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,W.,W.,,:4"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>. <q direct="unspecified">Where is he?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>I asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>He pointed out a rough, coarse-looking man in his shirt sleeves, sitting in a corner, with a crowd of cronies around him playing cards on the head of a barrel, accompanying the shuffle of the cards with boisterous oaths and coarse jests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/><q direct="unspecified">Excuse me,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">I will not interrupt the gentlemen in their sports.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>I never was introduced to him, and never, that I can call to memory, interchanged a word with him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>Soon after the war I visited some of my kinfolks in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany, New York</placeName>, and from some of my old friends met a rather cool reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>I soon found out that the reason for the cold shoulder was a communication to an interviewer, made by the redoubtable <rs>Colonel</rs>, and published in <num value="1">one</num> of the daily papers, setting forth, among other instances of his sagacity and valor, that an impertinent minister, named <persName n="Burrows,,,,," id="n0268.0014.00085.00834" reg="nearbymention:Burrows,J.,L.,,"><surname>Burrows</surname></persName>, had preached a discourse in <placeName reg="Libby prison">Libby prison</placeName>, in which he fiercely abused the prisoners for invading the sacred soil of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 29" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and intimating <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> that they all ought to have been shot on the field instead of being allowed to occupy such luxurious quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>This assault, according to his own showing, so aroused the ire of the doughty <rs>Colonel</rs>, that, regardless of consequences, he sprang to his feet, leaped to the pulpit, shook his fist in the preacher's face, and declared his instant determination, if such insult were repeated, to kick the parson down stairs at the risk of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>Of course he thus announced himself as a slashing fire-eater, to be admired and worshipped as an intrepid hero by the credulous interviewer and some of his readers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>It seemed a pity to spoil a fiction so sensational and narrated <q direct="unspecified">with circumstance,</q> but a card published in the papers, over my own signature, set the matter right with the good people of <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, by assuring them that I had never preached in <placeName reg="Libby prison">Libby prison</placeName> on any subject while <persName n="Corcoran,Colonel,,,," id="n0268.0014.00086.00835" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,W.,W.,,:4"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Corcoran</surname></persName> was there; that I had never spoken to him nor he to me on any subject, and that the whole statement was a vaporing canard woven out of the spider-web stuff of a braggart's flimsy brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>The close of <persName n="Corcoran,Colonel,,,," id="n0268.0014.00086.00836" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,W.,W.,,:4"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>'s life, as I have learned, was characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>In <dateStruct value="1863-12-"><month reg="12">December</month> <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, having meanwhile been exchanged and having joined his regiment, while drunk he mounted a spirited horse near <placeName reg="Fairfax Courthouse">Fairfax Courthouse</placeName>, and spurring and curbing the steed into madness, he was violently thrown from his back and had his neck broken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>The prisoners very naturally, like <persName n="Sterne,,,,," id="n0268.0014.00086.00837" reg="mostcommon:Sterne,nomatch:0"><surname>Sterne</surname></persName>'s starling, wanted to get out, and occasionally some would escape by digging tunnels, evading guards, bribing sentinels, scaling the roof and other ingenious devices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>They were very anxious to fix up a schedule for exchanges, and wrote piteous appeals to officials at <placeName key="tgn,7013962;tgn,2558074;tgn,2102017" n="0.164 000000.8181	placename;tgn,7013962;washington, district of columbia,District of Columbia,United States,North and Central America;0.055 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2558074;washington, mason, kentucky,Mason,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America;0.055 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2102017;washington college, washington, tennessee,Washington,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America" reg="washington, district of columbia,District of Columbia,United States,North and Central America;washington, mason, kentucky,Mason,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America;washington college, washington, tennessee,Washington,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America">Washington</placeName> and to friends everywhere to induce the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to consent to a system of exchanges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>But to exchange prisoners would be to recognize belligerent rights to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and that the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> seemed very unwilling at that time to do. I need not enter into the particulars of that controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>It has been proven with the clearness of demonstration, that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities were willing and anxious to exchange man for man, officer for officer, at every period during the whole war, and sometimes when a large balance of prisoners was upon their side, to let all go, upon the usual parole not to serve until regularly exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>The obstacles to exchanges were uniformly created by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>The prisoners of <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n0268.0014.00086.00838" reg="mostcommon:Libby,Hotel,,,:1"><surname>Libby</surname></persName> soon came to understand this, and while some dolefully declared themselves willing to suffer if their Government thought best, the multitude muttered curses both loud and deep against the <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> officials who prevented their liberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>They claimed that they were kept prisoners by their own Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>The controversy was forced to a crisis by the action of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities in relation to captured privateersmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>During the summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the privateers fitted out by authority of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> became quite troublesome by interfering with the commerce of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>A number of merchantmen were taken and sent into confederate or neutral ports or destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>In anticipation of such a mode of carrying on the war, <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0268.0014.00087.00839" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> on <dateStruct value="1861-04-18"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="18">18</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, had issued a proclamation declaring that all persons taken on privateers that had molested a vessel of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should <q direct="unspecified">be held amenable to the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the prevention and punishment of piracy.</q>

He was as brave a man as I ever met, and with perfect self-possession mounted the scaffold, and, glancing at the rope and the distance to the ground, quietly said to the marshal, who was fastening the cord to the cross-beam: <q direct="unspecified">Please make the fall longer!</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>As my company had never had the privilege of participating in battle, they were enthusiastic and very eager for the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>Upon forming <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n0268.0015.00093.00894" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,J.,B.,,"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, our battery was at once placed in position, and temporary breastworks erected, which occupied a prominent place, commanding an open field for about a mile direct, and half mile probably in width, with woods on both our right and left flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>To make an attack upon us, the enemy had to come directly through this open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>In a day or <num value="2">two</num>, however, <dateStruct value="-09-10"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="10">10th</day></dateStruct>, about <time value="2pm">2 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>My company had now prepared for action in reality, ready to give the enemy a warm reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>It is proper to state just here, that <orgName n="command"><persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n0268.0015.00093.00895" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,J.,B.,,"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> did not exceed <num value="1900">nineteen hundred</num> available men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>The enemy came bravely forward, and the battle raged furiously from <time value="2:30pm">2 1/2 o'clock, P. M.</time>, until darkness caused a cessation of hostilities, which was, doubtless, agreeable and acceptable to both parties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>The enemy fought with undaunted courage and bravery, making successive charges on our works.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>The enemy's loss in this engagement was considered heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>In the charges on our battery their loss must necessarily have been great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>Double the quantity of grape and canister were thrown into their ranks with fearful results&mdash;avenues were made through their ranks at times, yet they for awhile continued to close ranks, and forward, to meet shell and shot, until, doubtless, they were convinced that it was a useless sacrifice of life to persist in the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/><pb id="p.94" n="94"/></p> 
<p>In this battle our loss was comparatively small, which was due, in a great measure, to our respective positions on the field, our position being the most advantageous <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>While we had the advantage in position, yet we labored under the disadvantage in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>It was estimated that the enemy had upwards of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men on the field under <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0268.0015.00094.00899" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, while our command did not exceed <num value="1900">nineteen hundred</num> men, as above stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>That night, after the battle was over, about <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, owing to our small force, and the reported reinforcements of the enemy, <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n0268.0015.00094.00900" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> very wisely ordered a retreat as quietly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>Many of us were asleep behind our breastworks when the evacuation was ordered, broken down from fatigue and excitement, and nothing disturbed our slumber save the groans of the wounded, not far from our fortifications, until an officer of the guard awoke us, saying that we had orders to evacuate our position as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>Orders were obeyed accordingly as with as little difficulty as could be expected under the circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>Fortunately for us a bridge had just been completed across <placeName reg="Mount Nebo, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119310">Gauley river</placeName> that evening, upon which we passed over successfully to the opposite side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/><placeName reg="Carnifax Ferry">Carnifax Ferry</placeName> is about <measure n="1.5miles" type="distance">one and a half miles</measure> from the battle ground, and to reach that point a very rugged and rough road has to be traveled (and especially in the dark as we did), winding as it does on the mountain, and should you go too far to the right or left as it might be, you would in all probability be precipitated hundreds of feet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>The retreat was considered <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable of the war; in coming down this dangerous road to the ferry that dark night, we only lost <num value="1">one</num> caison, besides a good deal of baggage, which went over a precipice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>It was conceded by the command that had it not been for <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Guy,,,,," id="n0268.0015.00094.00901" reg="nearbymention:Guy,John,H.,,"><surname>Guy</surname></persName>'s</q> battery, <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n0268.0015.00094.00902" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,J.,B.,,"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> would have been captured at the battle of <placeName reg="Carnifax Ferry">Carnifax Ferry</placeName>; and <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n0268.0015.00094.00903" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> recognized this fact, and expressed himself as grateful to us for his brigade's successful escape on that memorable occasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>On the next morning just about sunrise the enemy commenced shelling our breastworks actively&mdash;not knowing we had abandoned our position about <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> that night, and that we were several miles on the other side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>After cannonading for several hours, and receiving no response, the works were at once taken possession of, although they did not pursue us further than the river.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>As the <orgName n="Confederate Artillery" type="artillery">Confederate artillery</orgName> labored throughout the war under disadvantages which have scarcely been known outside of its own ranks, and which can hardly be fully appreciated except by those who have served with that arm, I have thought it better to give in this form a connected account of the difficulties encountered, and the gradual improvements made in this branch of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/><pb id="p.99" n="99"/></p> 
<p>The drawbacks upon its efficiency at the beginning of the war were very serious, and came both from its organization and from its equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>The faults of its organization were recognized, and gradually overcome, within <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure>. The deficiencies of equipment, the result of causes many of which were beyond control, continued with but partial mitigation to the end of the war. The batteries were generally composed of but <num value="4">four</num> guns, which is not an economical arrangement; but as no objection was made to it, either at army headquarters or at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and as the scarcity both of horses and ordnance equipment made it difficult to get, and more so to maintain a <num value="6">six</num>-gun battery, it resulted in that few <num value="6">six</num>-gun batteries were put in the field, and nearly every <num value="1">one</num> of these was eventually reduced to <num value="4">four</num> guns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war each brigade of infantry had a battery attached, which was under the orders of the brigadecom-mander; while the remaining batteries with the army were organized into <num value="1">one</num> or more regiments, or battalions, under the command of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">Chief of Artillery</rs> on the staff of the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>The infantry at this period was organized in divisions, the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of which each had, or was supposed to have, on his staff a <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">Chief of Artillery</rs>, who was to exercise a general supervision over the brigade-batteries of the division.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>This organization was very inefficient, for the following reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>The brigade-batteries depended for their rations, forage, and all supplies, upon the brigade-staff, and received from brigadehead-quarters all orders, and thus acquired an independence of the division <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">Chief of Artillery</rs>, which was often fostered by the <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-Generals</rs> resenting any interference with parts of their commands by junior officers, and took from the <name>Chiefs</name> of Artillery the feeling of entire responsibility which every officer should feel for the condition and action of his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>In action the <rs>Brigadier</rs> could not give proper supervision both to his infantry and artillery; and the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">Chief of Artillery</rs> with the best intentions could himself manage the batteries but inefficiently, as they were so scattered in position along the line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>Now it is well known that, for artillery to produce its legitimate effects, its fire should be concentrated; and it is plain that under the above organization there could be but little concentration of batteries, except by bringing in the general reserve, which was commanded by the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">Chief of Artillery</rs> of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>This body, however, not being in intimate relations with the infantry, who always develop the situation, and being invariably put on the march <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> either behind the infantry commands or on some road to itself, was never promptly available on an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>Indeed, if the history of the <orgName n="General Reserve Artillery" type="artillery">general reserve artillery</orgName> during its entire existence be investigated, it will be found that although excellent in material, and comparatively so in equipment, the service that it rendered was greatly disproportionate to its strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>It resulted, therefore, that although the numerical strength of the <orgName n="Confederate Artillery" type="artillery">Confederate artillery</orgName> was as great in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war as ever afterwards, its weight in the scale of actual conflict is never seen to affect the result, until the <rs n="Second Battle of Manassas" type="battle">second battle of Manassas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>For instance, during the <measure n="7Days" type="date">Seven Days</measure> battles around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <orgName n="artillery"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0268.0016.00100.00943" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s artillery</orgName> numbered about <num value="300">three hundred</num> guns (nearly <num value="4">four</num> guns to every <num value="1000">thousand</num> men), <num value="98">ninety-eight</num> of these being in the general reserve; but in the history of the fighting this powerful organization has only left the faintest traces of its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>Now the wretched character of the ammunition which filled its chests may well be charged with many of its shortcomings; but an examination of the official reports of the battles will show, that scattered, and either uncommanded or too much commanded, as it was, there was an entire absence of that <hi rend="italics">ensemble</hi> of action necessary to the efficiency of all arms, but peculiarly so to the artillery; and that when fought at all, it was put in only in inefficient driblets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>The original orders directing the organization were not explicit upon this point, but common-sense and circumstances soon gave the proper turn to the matter, and not the slightest discord ever occurred.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>When <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organized, the battalion suffered for lack of field and staff-officers, owing to the fact that they were not organizations authorized by law, and consequently no appointments could be made for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>The promotions, however, were either never made in full, or else the officers appointed were sent to other duties, for during the whole of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> the majority of the battalions had but <num value="1">one</num> field-officer, which was often insufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>The staff-officers for the battalions, and for the <name>Chiefs</name> of Artillery, were provided generally by details from the batteries, which, though somewhat detrimental to the latter, operated well enough, except for quarter-master and commissary duties, for which bonded officers of these departments are absolutely required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/><pb id="p.104" n="104"/> Supernumerary officers of these and the medical departments were, however, gradually collected, and the battalions being then organized and supplied exactly as regiments, everything worked smoothly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>Each battalion organized from the united resources of its batteries a <q direct="unspecified">forge train,</q> under control of the ordnance officer, which was ample for all blacksmithing and harness repairs, and more economical and efficient than when each battery had to depend only on itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>These trains never exceeded <num value="1">one</num> wagon to <num value="3">three</num> guns, which was sufficient when within a day's march of a depot of supplies, but compelled the greatest saving in the use of ammunition when on active campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>Indeed, the limited resources of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the scarcity of skilled workmen and workshops, and the enormous consumption, kept the supply of ammunition always low.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>The great majority of the batteries took the field without having ever fired a round in practice, and passed through the war without aiming a gun at any target but the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>The order <q direct="unspecified">save your ammunition</q> was reiterated on every battle-field, and many an awful pounding had to be borne in silence from the <rs>Yankee</rs> guns, while every shot was reserved for their infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>The scarcity of ammunition was, however, the least difficulty connected with it, for its quality was the greatest incubus under which the artillery labored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>When the war commenced a small amount of smooth-bore ammunition was on hand in the <rs>Southern</rs> arsenals, which was of good quality, and was used in the early affairs and issued to the batteries <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> put in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>This ammunition was all put up with the <name>Bormann</name> fuse, and this fuse being adopted by the <rs>Confederate</rs> <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName>, a factory was established for its manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>Large quantities of ammunition fitted with these fuses were sent to the field in the summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and complaints of its bad <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> quality were immediately made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>Careful test being made of it, it was found that fully <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the shell exploded prematurely, and very many of them in the gun. The machinery for their manufacture was overhauled, and a fresh supply made and sent to the field, where the old ones were removed and the new were substituted, but no improvements was discernable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>The trouble was found to be in the hermetical sealing of the under-side of the <placeName reg="horse-shoe channel">horse-shoe channel</placeName> containing the fuse composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>Although this was seemingly accomplished at the factory, the shock of the discharge would unseat the <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse-shoe</rs>-shaped plug which closed this channel, and allow the flame from the composition to reach the charge of the shell without burning around to the magazine of the fuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>Attempts were made to correct the evil by the use of <rs n="white lead" type="product">white-lead</rs>, putty and leather under the fuse, and in the winter of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> these correctives were applied to every shell in the army with partial but not universal success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>Repeated attempts were made to improve the manufacture, but they accomplished nothing, and until after the <rs n="Battle of Chancellorsville" type="battle">battle of Chancellorsville</rs> the <name>Bormann</name> fuse continued in use, and premature explosions of shell were so frequent that the artillery could only be used over the heads of the infantry with such danger and demoralization to the latter that it was seldom attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>Earnest requests were made of the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> to substitute for the <name>Bormann</name> fuse, the common paper-fuses, to be cut to the required length and fixed on the field, as being not only more economical and more certain, but. as allowing, what is often very desirable, a greater range than <measure n="5seconds" type="date">five seconds</measure>, which is the limit of the <name>Bormann</name> fuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>These requests, repeated and urged in <dateStruct value="1863-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, on the strength of casualties occurring from our own guns among the infantry in front during the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs>, were at length successful in accomplishing the substitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>The ammunition already on hand, however, had to be used up, and its imperfections affected the fire even as late as <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>The paper-fuse was found to answer much better, and no further complaints of ammunition came from the smooth-bores.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>The difficulties which beset the rifled guns and their ammunition were, however, even greater than those under which the smooth-bores suffered so long, and they were never so nearly solved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>They were all adapted to the same ammunition, but were not of uniform length or shape, and varied in weight from a <num value="1000">thousand</num> to <measure n="1200l." type="pounds"><num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> pounds</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>The projectiles furnished for them at that time were of <num value="2">two</num> kinds, known as the <rs>Burton</rs> and the <rs>Archer</rs>, both of which were expected to receive the rotary motion from a leaden ring or sabot which the discharge forced into the grooves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>They differed about <measure n="2l." type="pounds"><num value="2">two</num> pounds</measure> in weight, and the charges for them differed <num value="3">three</num> ounces; but as the latter could not be easily distinguished from each other, they were used indiscriminately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>In the excitement of the battle these projectiles were supposed to possess superior accuracy and effect to the <name>Parrott</name> projectiles used by the enemy, and very favorable reports were made of them, and their manufacture was increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>Against an enemy in the field it was of little <pb id="p.107" n="107"/> real value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>Attempts were made to insure the ignition of the fuse by filing notches in the copper sabot to allow the flame of the discharge to pass, but they did not succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>The <q direct="unspecified">tumbling</q> was due to imperfect connection between the copper ring and the shell, which in its turn was due to the inferior quality of iron necessarily used (the best iron was saved for gun metal), to unskilled workmen, and to the fact that the demand greatly exceeded the supply, and even those which a careful inspection would have condemned were better than none.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>The causes of the premature explosions were never fully understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>Their heavy <name>English</name> carriages were more unwieldy than those of the <rs>American</rs> rifles, but taking all things into consideration, the guns are probably the most effective field-rifles yet made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>Besides these <name>English</name> rifles, a few captured <persName><foreName>James</foreName></persName> rifles (brass sixpounder smooth-bores, grooved to fire the <rs>James</rs> projectile), and some old iron <num value="4">four</num>-pounders grooved, were tried in the field for a short while, but were found to be very poor, and as a multiplicity of calibres rendered the supplying of ammunition very difficult, they were soon turned in. In fact, the variety of calibres comprised in the artillery was throughout the war a very great inconvenience, and materially affected the efficiency of the ordnance-service both in the quantity of ammunition carried and the facility with which it was supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>At the commencement of the war this variety was often almost ludicrously illustrated by single batteries of <num value="4">four</num> guns, of <num value="4">four</num> different calibres, and it was only after the battalions were well organized in the winter of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> that anything was done to simplify this matter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>The heavy guns which defended the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> against the enemy's fleet were principally the ordinary <measure n="8inch" type="distance">eight-inch</measure> and <measure n="10inch" type="distance">ten-inch</measure> columbiads, <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> and <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="rifles"><persName n="Brooke,,,,," id="n0268.0016.00110.00983" reg="mostcommon:Brooke,John,M.,,:1"><surname>Brooke</surname></persName>'s rifles</orgName></q> of <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> and <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure> calibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>These rifles only needed telescopic sights (which could not be made in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>) to be perfect arms of their class, their trajectories being more uniform than the sighting of the guns could be made by the eye.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>The skids would not be necessary where the desired range is not great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>During the siege of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> a number of iron <num value="12">twelve</num> and <num value="24">twenty-four</num> pounder <persName n="Coehorn,,,,," id="n0268.0016.00110.00985" reg="mostcommon:Coehorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Coehorn</surname></persName> mortars were made and rendered excellent service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>Wooden mortars were also made and tried for short ranges, but even when they did not split, the ranges were so irregular that they could not be made useful.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>In the location of batteries to defend lines of intrenchment, the campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> gave the <rs>Confederate</rs> artillerists and engineers much experience, and a few of the deductions therefrom may not be out of place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>Embrasures for the protection of the guns and men became unpopular, and were considered very objectionable, except for the rare cases where guns are to be reserved entirely for a flank defence of important points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>The objections to them are that they restrict the field of fire, and thus render it difficult to conform the defence to unforeseen attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>They are liable to be choked by the enemy's shot, and can only be repaired with much exposure of the men, and they do not accomplish their intended object, the protection of the men and guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>Sharpshooters' balls coming obliquely through the embrasures, or glancing off the gun or carriage, and artillery projectiles piercing the angles of the cheeks, make the limits of the dangerous space in rear of the embrasures very vague, and men are often unnecessarily exposed and hit without being aware of their danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>The barbette-gun not only has a greater field of view, but is more rapidly made ready, can be concealed from view until wanted, can only be silenced by being hit, offers a less conspicuous mark than an embrasure, and can be worked with less exposure of the artillerists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/><pb id="p.111" n="111"/> To accomplish this, trenches were dug in front of the gun and on each side about a yard from the wheels, in which the artillerists stood while loading and manoeuvring the gun, their heads being below the parapet, and only the hands of those ramming being exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>The dangerous space was well defined and easy to be avoided, and only the head of the gunner while in the act of aiming was at all endangered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>Mantlets for the gunners' protection while aiming were proposed, and some were constructed of thick oak-plank to rest upon the axles and trunnions, and they were used to some extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>The material of which they were composed, however, prevented their general adoption; for wooden mantlets would cause the explosion of a percussion-shell if struck by <num value="1">one</num>, and would themselves make dangerous splinters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>Barbette-guns are easily withdrawn from the enemy's view and fire, and yet kept ready for instant use.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>Magazines were seldom built except where the guns were exposed to a mortar-fire; dismounted limber-chests covered with tarpaulins being used instead without disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>A very important adjunct to each battery was found to be a <q direct="unspecified">look out</q> upon each flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>The <q direct="unspecified">looking out</q> is the most important part of the battery service, not only that no time may be lost on any appearance of the enemy, but that the aiming of the gunners may be superintended and corrected; and to insure its being well done it should be made as safe as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>Except in the siege of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> seldom built <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> lines of intrenchments in rear of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; not from any doubt of their value, but because they rarely had the force to spare from the front line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>Even when the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> was built it was principally intended as a means of covered communication which could not be otherwise obtained, and in was only occupied by a few guns in rear of the most exposed points of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, which were designed to check the enemy should he penetrate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>Where the ammunition is safe to be fired over the heads of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, it would doubtless be an excellent plan to put all of the rifled guns in detached batteries in rear of exposed points, where they would have an excellent effect in checking an enemy who should penetrate and either seek to advance or sweep down the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>An instance of the effect of such batteries may be found in the <rs n="Battle of the Crater" type="battle">battle of the Crater</rs>, at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1864-07-30"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="30">30th</day> <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, which is indeed about the only case where the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines ever had even detached batteries in rear of a point gotten possession of by the enemy.

Each battery took in flank any advance upon the other, and the enemy was kept under shelter of the earth thrown up by the explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>A somewhat similar position of batteries <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> checked the <rs>Yankee</rs> advance after the capture of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1864-09-29"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg="29">29th</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, and the <rs>Confederate</rs> assault on <placeName reg="Fort Steadman">Fort Steadman</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="1865-03-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> was discomfitted in the same way. Indeed the <rs>Federal</rs> intrenchments very frequently comprised a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of redoubts, if not of infantry parapet, in rear of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and its very moral effect often prevented attempts upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> which promised well.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>With scarcely a single assistant instructed in the peculiar and technical details which are the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> elements of an ordnance officer's attainments, and without even an office organization for the transaction of business, the whole machinery of a department was to be organized, which, to illustrate with the history of a single article, should induce the formation of saltpetre from the atmosphere by slow chemical affinities; separate and refine it from impurities by most delicate processes; provide for it, and combine with it sulphur and charcoal in the dangerous operations of the powder manufactory; transport it safely to the arsenal and put it up in safe and convenient cartridges; transport it to the field of battle, and have it at hand where the particular gun to which it is adapted shall receive it ready for use at the moment it is required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>And in addition to these operations, the same department, to prevent waste and loss, and to know and anticipate the wants of the army, must institute a system of reports and accounts, which shall not only keep its chief <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> informed of the supplies in the magazine of every gun, and in the cartridge-box of every soldier in the whole Confederacy, but which shall trace every ounce of saltpetre in all of its various shapes, and hold to a rigid accountability every man who handles it from the moment that it is washed from the nitre-bed until its use upon the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>A private note at the same time brought the intelligence that that city, so long threatened, and indeed, once already assailed by sea, was now to undergo a vigorous and combined attack from both land and naval forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>The day was an eventful <num value="1">one</num> to us without this additional stimulant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>We had just learned, too, of the check received by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0268.0018.00119.01066" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,Edward,,:62"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> at the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs>, and now came the summons to tell that our turn had come for a little squeeze in the folds of the traditional <q direct="unspecified">Anaconda,</q> that the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> had so graphically depicted as encircling the <rs>South</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>The men received the orders with enthusiasm&mdash;indeed, when was it otherwise with the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>Thoroughly conversant, as they all were, with the details of the war, they could not but be depressed by the news of such grave reverses to our arms as the morning's mail had brought them, and they gladly welcomed the relief that active service promised from the tedium of camp life, and the necessity of thinking upon melancholy subjects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>Our march began in the midst of a terrific thunder-storm, that had the effect, not only of cooling down any overplus of excitement, but also of rendering the road to the city almost a quagmire throughout its entire length.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>There are pleasanter ways of spending a summer's evening than in trudging for <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure>, through mud and rain, in heavy marching order; but upon this, as on similar occasions during the war, I was deeply impressed by the uncomplaining patience and cheerfulness with which the men endured hardships that few would care to face now, but which, then, were regarded as mere matters of course&mdash; distasteful, certainly&mdash;but not worth talking about.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>The storm delayed our march considerably, and upon reaching the depot we found that the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 32">Thirty-second regiment</orgName>, which had been stationed at a point nearer the city, had already taken train for <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>We, too, were soon <hi rend="italics">en route</hi>, and early in the forenoon of the following <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> day&mdash;<dateStruct value="1863-07-10"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="10">10</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>&mdash;the <num value="3">three</num> battalions were safely in bivouac at the terminus of the <orgName n="Savannah and Charleston Railroad" type="railroad">Savannah and Charleston railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>Here we were met by a staff-officer, who informed us that we were to reinforce the garrison of <orgName n="Battery Wagner" type="battery">Battery Wagner</orgName>, on <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>, and that at dusk the necessary transportation would be furnished to take us down to the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>He also told us that the enemy, under cover of a tremendous fire of artillery, from batteries on <placeName reg="Folly Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2333489">Folly Island</placeName>, which had been unmasked during the night, had effected a lodgment on the south end of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>, and had driven our forces back upon <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Wagner</placeName>,</q> which fortification would, doubtless, be attacked on the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>Events proved that this last was a feint, to distract attention from the main attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>All day we remained quietly at this place, endeavoring to make out the various points of interest in the beautiful harbor spread before us, and watching the little clouds of smoke that ascended from the parapets of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, as its guns were slowly fired at the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>It was a lovely day, clear and bright, without a cloud in the sky. The vegetation about us, freshened by the rain of the previous evening, added sweet odors to the soft sea-breeze that came up the bay. Upon our left the city of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> <q direct="unspecified">sat like a queen,</q> her roof tops and spires glittering in the sunlight, while afar down, over an expanse of shining water, could be seen the ships of the fleet swinging lazily at their anchors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>The picture was beautiful, and for <num value="1">one</num>, I would have found it difficult to realize that beneath it all were the grim front and iron hand of war, but for the dull rumble of the constantly recurring shot from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>That was <q direct="unspecified">the fly in the ointment of the apothecary,</q> that <q direct="unspecified">the spectre at the feast,</q> that the refrain ever ringing in our ears and suggesting the unwelcome thought&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">it looks peaceful enough now, but just wait until to-morrow.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/></p> 
<p>About nightfall we embarked in a steamer that had been sent for us and, after many delays, were safely landed at <placeName key="tgn,2271638" n="1.000 4" reg="cummings point, charleston, south carolina">Cumming's Point</placeName>, on the northern end of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>The line was formed at once, and we set out for <orgName n="Battery Wagner" type="battery">Battery Wagner</orgName>, reporting to its commander, <persName n="Graham,Colonel,,,," id="n0268.0018.00120.01067" reg="mostcommon:Graham,William,,,:3"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Graham</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="21SCRegiment">Twenty-First South Carolina regiment</orgName>, at about <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> at night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>At the risk of being somewhat tedious, I must here devote a few lines to the topography of this famous Island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>It is a long, narrow strip of sand, running almost due <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> for about <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> miles, varying in breadth from, say <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> at the narrowest point to half a mile at the broadest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>Upon the west side the <rs type="place">Island</rs> is separated from <placeName reg="James Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2418933">James Island</placeName> by <placeName reg="Vincent's Creek">Vincent's Creek</placeName> and by broad marshes intersected by numerous salt water creeks, while its eastern shore is washed throughout its entire length by the waters of the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic Ocean</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>At the south end were the batteries from which our troops had been driven in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/><placeName reg="Light House Inlet">Light House Inlet</placeName> separated this point from <placeName reg="Folly Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2333489">Folly Island</placeName>, and across this Inlet the enemy had suddenly thrown their forces, under cover of a furious fire of artillery, as has already been stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>At the northern extremity of the island, known as <placeName key="tgn,2271638" n="1.000 4" reg="cummings point, charleston, south carolina">Cumming's Point</placeName>, was located <orgName n="Battery Gregg" type="battery">Battery Gregg</orgName>, and about <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile to the south of this, <orgName n="Battery Wagner" type="battery">Battery Wagner</orgName> stretched entirely across the island from the sea on the left, to <placeName reg="Vincent's Creek">Vincent's Creek</placeName> on the right, the battery facing due south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>It was an irregular work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>On the extreme left, a heavy traverse and curtain protected the sally port and gave a flanking fire down the beach, to any force that might assail the main work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>Then came a salient, <num value="1">one</num> face of which commanded the ship channel, then a broken line, arranged for flanking fires, extending to the marsh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>The parapets were solid, and a broad, deep, dry moat added boldness to their profile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>Within the parade were bomb-proofs and lightly constructed barracks for the small garrison that had heretofore occupied the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>The armament consisted of <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10-inch</measure> Columbiad and some <num value="32">32</num>-pounders in the sea face, and <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> lighter guns, chiefly howitzers on the land-side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>A short distance in front of the right of the line an inward bend of <persName n="Vincent,,,,," id="n0268.0018.00121.01068" reg="mostcommon:Vincent,Thomas,M.,,:1"><surname>Vincent</surname></persName>'s creek narrowed the island in such manner as to render it obligatory upon an attacking force to deliver its assault only against the left half of the fort, and also affording scant opportunity for the deployment of such a column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>In point of fact this peculiar feature in the topography proved of great service to us, and correspondingly troublesome to the enemy in the operations that followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>The surface of the island is but little raised above the level of the sea and presents a glaring stretch of white sandy hillocks, which were sparsely dotted with the coarse grasses of the coast, and which changed their contour in every high wind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>There is but to add that the main channel by which ships enter <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> runs within easy gunshot of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName> from <num value="1">one</num> end of it to the other, then crosses to the northward and passes between <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> on <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, built upon a shoal about midway between the <num value="2">two</num> islands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>From this rapid sketch, reference being had to the map, it will be <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> readily appreciated that from the base held by the enemy, a <hi rend="italics">front</hi> attack upon <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> could begin here and nowhere else; and that, as the defences of the inner harbor were at that time imperfect, the immediate fall of <persName n="Wagner,,,,," id="n0268.0018.00122.01069" reg="mostcommon:Wagner,nomatch:0"><surname>Wagner</surname></persName> would gravely impair the safety of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>But that little mound of sand had its history to make, a story that will ever bring a flush of honest pride to the face of every man who participated in the long defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>As soon as we had reported to <persName n="Graham,Colonel,,,," id="n0268.0018.00122.01070" reg="mostcommon:Graham,William,,,:3"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Graham</surname></persName>, the troops were put into position, the <orgName type="regiment" key="18Battalion">Eighteenth battalion</orgName> in the salient, the <num value="12" type="ordinal">Twelfth</num> upon its right, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA1">First Georgia</orgName> on the left, occupying the flanking curtain and the sea face, to which allusion has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>The guns were all manned by <orgName type="mil" key="SCArtillery">South Carolina artillery</orgName> and the right and centre of the fort were held by infantry from the same State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>The men were cautioned that an attack was expected at daylight, and then, tired out, they slept on their arms upon the ramp, ready at a moment's call for action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/><persName n="Werner,Captain,C.,,," id="n0268.0018.00122.01071" reg="expanded:Werner,Claus,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Werner</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="German volunteers" type="volunteers">German Volunteers</orgName>, was appointed officer of the night, and in a few minutes every sound was hushed save the swash of the waves upon the beach, and the occasional challege of a sentinel from his post.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>My own resting place was upon the parapet, and looking up to the cloudless heavens above, the solemn glory of the night impressed itself upon my last waking thoughts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> peep of dawn, on the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="2">11th</day></dateStruct>, we were wakened by a few straggling shots in our front, followed by a ringing cheer and <num value="3">three</num> distinct volleys of musketry from our picket line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>The anticipated assault was upon us. In an instant, the garrison was aroused, and as the men had slept in position they had only to spring to their feet, and we were ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>Now we could see our pickets, their duty having been faithfully performed, retiring rapidly towards our right, in accordance with the instructions they had received, so as to uncover the advancing columns of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>And, then, through the dim, gray light of the morning we could distinguish a dark, blue mass of men moving up the beach towards us, at the double quick, cheering as they came.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>Then came the thunder of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun (what old soldier is there who does not recall <hi rend="italics">its</hi> startling effect), then another and another, then the deafening rattle of small arms, mingled with yells and cheers, and we were fairly in the midst of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>The issue was never doubtful for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>The attacking column attempted to deploy after passing the narrow neck in front, but entirely failed to do so; while the dense formation rendered it an easy mark for both infantry and <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>Now, is not the fashion of these words a very revelation to him who will consider of the fashion of the man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>He has time to tell that which is essential, but no word more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>He makes it known, that his war <hi rend="italics">means work</hi>, and is no dilettantism, or amateur soldiering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>Nor is it the warfare of gallant barbarians, wherein much castramental laziness or even license can redeem itself by some burst of daring and animal phrensy; but <q direct="unspecified">early rising and industry.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>And, if yes, then let thy act follow thy assent without dallying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>I found him at a place, gateway of the mountains that befriended him, named of the vicinage <placeName reg="Conrad's Store">Conrad's Store</placeName>; the <rs>Shenandoah</rs> flood before him, and beyond, multitudinous enemies thronging&mdash;held at bay, checkmated, gnashing vainly upon him; while he, in the midst of din and marching battalions, going to the watch-post, and splashing squadrons, splashing through mire most villainous, and of snow-wracks and sleet of the ungenial spring, <q direct="unspecified">Winter lingering in the lap of spring,</q>&mdash;stood calm, patient, modest, yet serious, as though abashed at the meanest man's reverence for him; but at sternest peril unabashed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>After most thoughtful, yea, feminine care of food and fire for me, he took me apart saying, <q direct="unspecified">I am glad that you have come.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>But I told him that I was come, I feared, uselessly, only to reveal my unfitness, and retire; already half-broken by camp-disease, and enervated by student's toil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/><q direct="unspecified">But I have a graver disqualification, which candor requires me to disclose to you, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of mortals: I am not sanguine of success; our leaders and legislators do not seem to me to comprehend the crisis, nor our people to respond to it; and, in truth, the impulse which I feel to fly out of my sacred calling, to my country's succour, is chiefly the conviction that her need is so desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>The effect on me is the reverse of that which the old saw ascribes to the rats when they believe the ship is sinking.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/><q direct="unspecified">But,</q> saith he, laughing; <q direct="unspecified">If the rats will only run this way, the ship will not sink.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>Thus was I overruled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>You will remember that theory of his character, which most men were pleased to adopt, when he was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entrusted with command: <q direct="unspecified">This man,</q> said they, <q direct="unspecified">is true, and brave, and religious; but narrow and mechanical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>He is the man to lead a fighting battalion, under the direction of a head that can think; but strategy, prudence, science, are not in him. His very reserve and reluctance to confer result from his own consciousness, that he has no faculty of speech nor power of thought, to debate with other men.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>Had I been capable of so misjudging his silence and modesty, as to adopt this theory, his career must ere this have blown it all into thin air; the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first Manassas</rs> and <placeName key="tgn,7017708" n="1.000 36" reg="winchester, winchester, virginia">Kernstown</placeName>, and the retreat before <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0268.0019.00129.01107" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> had already done <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> <hi rend="italics">that</hi>, for all save fools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>All who served under him had already learned that there was in him abundant thought and counsel, deep and sagacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>He asked questions of all; sought counsel of none; gave no account to any man of his matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>Once only, did <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> ever sit for him, to help him to <q direct="unspecified">make up his mind.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>And it was then, by their inferior sagacity, made up so little to his liking, that he asked such aid no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>Power of speech there was in him also, as I witnessed; such truly eloquent speech, as uttered quickly the very heart of his thought, and could fire the heart of the listener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>But he deemed that the controversy he waged was no longer parliamentary; that the only logic seemly for us at that stage, was the <hi rend="italics">ultima ratio Regum</hi>. To such respondent as the times then appointed unto him, the cannon peal, and the charging yell of the <q direct="unspecified">men in grey,</q> were the reply, which to him seemed eloquent: all else was emptier than silence</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>But instead of leading you to a brief review of his whole career, which would perforce be trite, because hurried, I would describe to you some <num value="1">one</num> of the exploits of his genius, which best illustrates it. <num value="1">One</num> of these I suppose to be <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>Such was the outlook of affairs upon the <dateStruct value="-06-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>Such was the achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>Let us see how his genius wrought it out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>The skill of the strategist is in availing himself of the natural features of the country, which may be helpful to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>From a point east of <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName> to another point east of <placeName reg="Harrisonburg, Harrisonburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2112170">Harrisonburg</placeName> extends the <rs type="place">Masanuttin mountain</rs>, a ridge of <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> length, parallel to the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, and dividing the <rs type="place">Great Valley</rs> into <num value="2">two</num> valleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>Down the eastern of these, usually called the <placeName reg="Page, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002178">Page county</placeName> valley, the main river passes, down the other passes the great road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>Up this road, west of the <rs type="place">Masanuttin mountain</rs> was <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0268.0019.00131.01118" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> now retreating, in his deliberate, stubborn fashion, while <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0268.0019.00131.01119" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>'s <num value="18000">18,000</num> pursued him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>But their teacher would show them again, that they were not yet instructed enough to descend from that <q direct="unspecified">bad eminence.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>Let me explain this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>The Blue-Ridge, parallel to the great <address><street n="Valley road">Valley road</street></address>, is penetrated only at certain <q direct="unspecified">gaps,</q> by roads practicable for armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>When <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0268.0019.00131.01127" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pursued him up the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, he had turned aside at <placeName reg="Harrisonburg, Harrisonburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2112170">Harrisonburg</placeName> to the eastward, and seated himself behind the river at <placeName reg="Conrad's Store">Conrad's Store</placeName> in the mouth of <placeName reg="Swift Run Gap">Swift Run Gap</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Now, as we marched, with indomitable pluck he was at the head of the regiment though his trowsers were worn to a fringe from the knees down, and his bare feet cracked and bleeding left their marks upon the frozen road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>At this moment a private of cavalry came riding by&mdash;he turned and looked at the poor lad&mdash; then reining in his horse he threw his leg over the pommell of the saddle and took off <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> shoe and then the other, and throwing the pair of them down at the poor fellow's feet with these words: <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Friend, you need them more than I do</hi>,</q> he galloped away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>The answer was in <num value="2">two</num> little circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>And here let me remark upon a mischievous specimen of red-tapeism, which I saw often practiced to our detriment, even sometimes by <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0268.0024.00151.01372" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who was least bound by professional trammels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>It was the employing of engineer officers, with their pocket compasses and pretty, <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> crayon, hypothetical maps, as country guides; instead of the men of the vicinage with focal knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>Far better would it have been for <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0268.0024.00151.01373" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had he now inquired among <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0268.0024.00151.01374" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,nomatch:0"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>'s troopers for the boy who had hunted foxes and rabbits through the coppices around <placeName reg="Lewiston, Androscoggin, Maine" key="tgn,7013885">Lewiston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>The other blunder was, in appearance, even more trivial: The footbridge, constructed by moonlight, and designed to pass <num value="4">four</num> men abreast, proved at <num value="1">one</num> point so unsteady that only a single plank of it could be safely used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>Thus, what was designed to be a massive column was reduced from that point onward to a straggling <q direct="unspecified"><name>Indian</name> file.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>Instead of passing over the infantry in the early morning, we were still urging them forward when the appointed <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> had come and gone, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack on <persName n="Shields,,,,," id="n0268.0024.00151.01376" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><surname>Shields</surname></persName>, made with forces wholly inadequate, had met with a bloody repulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2171"/>That it was at least questionable whether such men were not predestined slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2172"/>That the government was manifestly unequal to the arduous enterprise and entangled in the plodding precedents of dull mediocrity, instead of rising to the exertion of lofty genius and heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2173"/>Witness, for instance, the deplorable military policy which left our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> critical victory without fruits; a blunder which no government would be allowed by a righteous <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> to repeat often, with impunity; because it is as truly a law of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> administration, as of His grace, which is expressed in the fearful question: <q direct="unspecified">How can ye escape who neglect so great salvation?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2174"/>That neither government nor people seemed awake to the absolute necessity of striking quickly in a revolutionary war like ours; but they were settling down to a regular protracted contest, in which the machinery of professional warfare would gradually, but surely, abolish that superiority of the <rs>Southern</rs> citizen-soldier over the <rs>Yankee</rs> mercenary, which the honor and courage of the former gave him while both were undrilled; a routine-war in which we should measure our limited resources against their unlimited ones, instead of measuring patriotic gallantry against sluggishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2175"/>That the final issue of such a struggle must be the exhaustion of our means of resistance by gradual attrition, which would render all our victories unavailing.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>Our experience for the next week was a trying <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>Failing in the direct attack, the enemy's endeavor seemed to be to make our berth uncomfortably warm, and here the success was undoubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>Day after day the monitors&mdash;some <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> in number&mdash;and that tremendous war vessel, the <q direct="unspecified">New Ironsides,</q> would take their positions directly opposite the fort, at a distance of <num value="6">six</num> to <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure>, the wooden ships being at much longer range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>Then would be poured in upon us a steady stream of shot and shell, much more pleasant to dwell upon as a memory than it was to endure, while upon the land side new batteries were built by the enemy, and each day the weight of metal thrown against us would seem to be heavier than the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>I well remember the approach of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> monitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>How deliberate its movements; how insignificant its appearance; the deck almost level with the water, and the little black turret giving small promise of its hidden power for attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>My curiosity about the vessel was great, but was soon to be satisfied without stint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>There was a slow revolving motion of the turret, a cloud of smoke, a deafening roar, and then, with the rush and noise of an express train, the huge <measure n="15inch" type="distance">fifteen inch</measure> shell, visible at every point of its trajectory, passed over head and burst far in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>The next shell exploded in the parapet, covering several of us with dirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>The introduction was complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/><pb id="p.159" n="159"/> Thenceforward we held these singular looking craft in wholesome respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>The <q direct="unspecified">Ironsides,</q> however, was probably the most formidable ship of the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>She is said to have carried at bow and stern <measure n="200l." type="pounds"><num value="200">two hundred</num> pound</measure> <persName n="Parrott,,,,," id="n0268.0025.00159.01414" reg="mostcommon:Parrott,nomatch:0"><surname>Parrott</surname></persName> guns, and <num value="9">nine</num> <measure n="11inch" type="distance">eleven-inch</measure> Dahlgrens on a side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>Her broadsides were not fired in volley, but gun after gun, in rapid succession, the effect upon those who were at the wrong end of the guns being exceedingly demoralizing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>Whenever she commenced there was a painful uncertainty as to what might happen before she got through.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>We had but <num value="1">one</num> gun with which to fight the monitors&mdash;the <measure n="10inch" type="distance">ten-inch</measure> Columbiad located just over the sally-port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>True, the <num value="30">thirty</num>-twos were tried for a while, but they were so impotent to harm the heavy mail of the ships that their use was soon discontinued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>This Columbiad was manned, I think, by the <rs>Matthew</rs>'s Artillery, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and the gunner, <persName n="Matthews,,Frazer,,," id="n0268.0025.00159.01415" reg="default:Matthews,Frazer,,,"><foreName>Frazer</foreName> <surname>Matthews</surname></persName>, was as noble a soldier as the siege produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>In the midst of the hottest fire he would stand quietly on the chassis directing the aiming of the gun with all the coolness and precision of target practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>Never flurried, always intent upon the work before him, and never giving the signal to fire until the aim was taken to his entire satisfaction, the accuracy of his marksmanship was great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>Again and again I saw the solid <measure n="10inch" type="distance">ten-inch</measure> shot strike upon the sides of the monitors, only to break into a <num value="1000">thousand</num> fragments, that would splash into the sea like so much grapeshot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we thought that no harm was done by our fire, but we learned afterwards that the concussion within the turret was tremendous, and that, among others, <num value="1">one</num> very prominent officer had been killed by it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>Unfortunately, our Columbiad was soon dismounted, and although a new carriage was supplied, that too, was knocked to pieces in short order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>Indeed, this experience was repeated half a dozen times.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>Such continuous cannonading of course seriously impaired the integrity of our parapets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>But as at that stage of the siege the firing ceased at nightfall, opportunity was given to repair damages, and all night long the garrison would work, filling sand bags and painfully endeavoring to make good the yawning chasms and ragged craters left by the terrible missiles that had been hurled into the fort during the day. There was a constant strain upon all the faculties, that gave little time for anything save the stern duties of the hour, and yet there were humorous incidents ever occurring that even now will bring smiles to the lips of all who remember them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/><pb id="p.160" n="160"/></p> 
<p>Who can forget <q direct="unspecified">Aquarius,</q> the water bearer, as he was dubbed&mdash; a simple-hearted fellow, from the backwoods of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, who devoted his time to bringing water to the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>Both heels of his shoes were carried away by a shell, and from that time he went barefooted&mdash;there was <q direct="unspecified">danger in shoes,</q> he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>And, then, the simple manner in which, on returning from <num value="1">one</num> of his trips to the well, he held up <num value="1">one</num> full jug and only the handle of another, saying, apologetically, <q direct="unspecified">Oh, a shell took hit.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/></p> 
<p>I can see in my mind's eye, too, the brilliant engineering feat of a member of the <rs>Oglethorpe</rs> <orgName type="mil" key="Light">Light Infantry</orgName>, who while cooking a little dinner in the open parade, provided protection for himself by placing an empty flour barrel alongside of the fire, and gravely sticking his head into it whenever the scream of a shell warned him of approaching trouble.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>During the week <persName n="Taliaferro,General,,,," id="n0268.0025.00160.01416" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, assumed command, and on the night of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> fresh troops were sent to relieve us&mdash;and it may be mentioned here, that this plan of changing commanders, and the garrison (or at least a part of it), every few days, was continued throughout the siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>In fact, the strain upon body and mind was so unremitting, that a week's tour of duty was about as much as any men could undergo at a time, as there was no rest day nor night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>We were landed at <placeName reg="Three Trees, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096824">Fort Johnson</placeName>, on <placeName reg="James Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2418933">James Island</placeName>, a little before dawn on the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> and were just getting comfortably settled in the village then existing at that point, when a tremendous cannonading began against the fort we had just left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>All day long it continued, exceeding in fierceness and rapidity anything we had yet witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>The noise was terrific, great clouds of smoke hung over the devoted battery, and huge columns of sands rose high in the air, as shell after shell rent the parapets, while only an occasional shot in return gave any sign that there was life left in the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>With mingled feelings we watched the bombardment, full of anxiety for the ultimate result, and for the safety of our comrades in the fort, there was, also, it must be confessed, a profound complacency at the thought that we were well out of it ourselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>A little before dusk the firing suddenly ceased on the part of the enemy, and almost instantaneously a rapid succession of guns from <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, trained for the beach of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>, gave notice that another attempt was to be made to throw a column into <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Wagner</placeName> by escalade.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>To this end he had organized a strong column of <num value="2">two</num> brigades (<num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> brigade being held in reserve), under command of <persName n="Seymour,General,,,," id="n0268.0025.00161.01418" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName>, the formation being made behind the sand-hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>From these <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> there were constant additions to the list of our losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>The wounded (and the wounds were mostly of a terrible character), were all brought in among the men, and the surgical operations were performed in the midst of the crowd, by the light of candles, that dimly burned in the heavy air from which all vitality had been drawn.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> early, they threw over the river a heavy force opposite the north end of the ridge and just below the mouth of <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, at the same time displaying a heavy force in our immediate front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>After visiting the right, and making dispositions there for the new development in that direction, I returned towards the left, to find a heavy cannonading going on from the enemy's batteries on our forces occupying the slope of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>, between the crest and the river.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>Upon his urgent appeal, another brigade was dispatched in the afternoon to his support&mdash;though it appeared his own forces had not been brought into action, and I proceeded to the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>Arriving just before sunset, I found that we had lost all the advantages of the position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>Orders were immediately given for the ground to be disputed <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> until we could withdraw our forces across <placeName reg="Chattanooga Creek, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2233900">Chattanooga Creek</placeName> and the movement was commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>This having been successfully accomplished our whole forces were concentrated on the ridge, and extended to the right to meet the movement in that direction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>On <date>Wednesday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="25">25th</day></dateStruct>, I again visited the extreme right, now under <persName n="Hardee,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0268.0033.00207.01805" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,W.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName>, and threatened by a heavy force, while strong columns could be seen marching in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>A very heavy force in line of battle confronted our left and centre.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>On my return to this point, about <time value="11am">11 A. M.</time>, the enemy's forces were being moved in heavy massses from Lookout and beyond, to our front, while those in front extended to our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>They formed their lines with great deliberation, just beyond the range of our guns, and in plain view of our position.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>Though greatly outnumbered, such was the strength of our position that no doubt was entertained of our ability to hold it, and every disposition was made for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>Our batteries opened with fine effect, and much confusion was produced before they reached musket range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>In a short time the roar of musketry became very heavy, and it was soon apparent that the enemy had been repulsed in my immediate front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>While riding along the crest congratulating the troops, intelligence reached me that our line was broken on my right, and the enemy had crowned the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>Assistance was promptly dispatched under <persName n="Bate,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0268.0033.00207.01809" reg="mostcommon:Bate,W.,B.,,:2"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Bate</surname></persName>, who had so successfully maintained the ground in my front, and I proceeded to the rear of the broken line to rally our retiring troops and return them to the crest to drive the enemy back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>By a decided stand here, the enemy was entirely checked, and that portion of our force to the right remained intact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>All to the left, however, except a portion of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Bate,,,,," id="n0268.0033.00208.01816" reg="mostcommon:Bate,W.,B.,,:2"><surname>Bate</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, was entirely routed, and in rapid flight, nearly all the artillery haying been shamefully abandoned by its infantry support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>Every effort which could be made by myself and staff, and by many other mounted officers, availed but little.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>A panic, which I never before witnessed, seemed to have seized upon officers and men, and each seemed to be struggling for his personal safety, regardless of his duty or his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>Fortunately it was now near nightfall, and the country and roads in our rear were fully known to us, but equally unknown to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>As soon as all the troops had crossed, the bridges over the <rs>Chickamauga</rs> were destroyed, to impede the enemy, though the stream was fordable in several places.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>No satisfactory excuse can possibly be given for the shameful conduct of our troops, on the left, in allowing their line to be penetrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>The position was <num value="1">one</num> which ought to have been held by a line of skirmishers against any assaulting column; and, wherever resistance was made, the enemy fled in disorder, after suffering heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>Those who reached the ridge did so in a condition of exhaustion, <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> from the great physical exertion in climbing, which rendered them powerless, and the slightest effort would have destroyed them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>Having secured much of our artillery they availed themselves of our panic, and turning our guns upon us enfiladed our lines both right and left, rendering them entirely untenable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>Had all parts of the line been maintained by equal gallantry and persistance, no enemy could ever have dislodged us; and but <num value="1">one</num> possible reason presents itself to my mind in explanation of this bad conduct in veteran troops, who had never before failed in any duty assigned them, however difficult and hazardous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>They had for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> confronted the enemy marshalling his immense forces in plain view, and exhibiting to their sight such a superiority in numbers as may have intimidated weak minds and untried soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>The enemy made pursuit as far as <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName>, but was so handsomely checked by <persName n="Cleburne,Major-General,,,," id="n0268.0033.00209.01824" reg="mostcommon:Cleburne,Pat,,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Cleburne</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gist,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0268.0033.00209.01825" reg="mostcommon:Gist,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Gist</surname></persName>, in command of their respective divisions, that he gave us but little annoyance.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3465"/>It is not too late to say over the bier of a friend or patriot or chieftain what might have seemed indelicate and immoderate flattery if spoken in his living presence; for, while their are some men whom it is our duty to forget, burying their memories with their bones; yet, there are others whom it becomes our duty to study; men whose lives are revelations, and whose histories are the unfolding of a manhood that reveals the purpose of their Creator.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/>And such men merit our study, not only because their experiences may assist us in solving the problems of life (for such an aim might be marked with an intensity of selfishness), but also because we should carry in our hearts the memories of those who, in unselfish and noble lives, sought the glory of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the good of men. <pb id="p.242" n="242"/></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3471"/>As if conscious that his end was near, and weary of the struggles of life that were relentless even amidst the infirmities of age, he wrapped his mantle about him, ready to be gathered unto his fathers, and his spirit passed calmly and peacefully into the audience chamber of the blest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3472"/>He was born in <placeName reg="Claiborne, Mississippi, United States" key="tgn,2001096">Claiborne county, Mississippi</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>, of a house and lineage, to the honor of which no word need be spoken before this assembly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3473"/>As a youth he evidently manifested a precocity that encouraged his father to give him special educational advantages, which at that early day were purchased at great expense and inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3474"/>He passed through a preparatory course in a <orgName n="Classical School" type="school">classical school</orgName> at <placeName reg="Morristown, Morris, New Jersey" key="tgn,7014108">Morristown, New Jersey</placeName>, a State long ago famous for its educational facilities, and afterwards received an appointment of cadetship in the national school at <placeName reg="West Point, Clay, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057765">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3475"/>And while there he was associated as classmate and confederate with such men as <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0268.0039.00242.02226" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnston,,Joseph,E.,," id="n0268.0039.00242.02227" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnston,,Albert,Sidney,," id="n0268.0039.00242.02228" reg="default:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><foreName>Albert</foreName> <foreName>Sidney</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n0268.0039.00242.02229" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, men of whom Southern history and Southern chivalry shall ever be justly proud.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3476"/>It might have been expected that by such associations and influences he would have been tempted at once into public life; but public life as a matter of profession seemed to have no attractions for <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> him, and returning to his native home he devoted himself to the unostentatious calling of a planter's life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3477"/>And in this pursuit, which engaged but a small share of his diversified gifts, he found happiness and success, and won such confidence among the business men of the day, that, in the language of <num value="1">one</num> of his old friends&mdash;his name was good for any amount he saw fit to write it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3478"/>But while yet a young man, in <dateStruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></dateStruct>, he was called by his fellowcitizens to represent them in the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName>, and upon his return, as an evidence of his fidelity and worth, he was returned to the <rs>State Capitol</rs> as a member of the <name>Senate</name>, and again later in life he was honored with the highest gift in the keeping of his fellow-citizens and became their Governor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>Considering his modest and retiring disposition, some distinguishing excellence of character, some uncommon and acknowledged gifts must have lifted this man above his fellows, and commended him to their confidence and affection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3480"/>And as we pause a few moments to-day on our way to the final resting place of our honored dead, let us calculate some of those virtues that made him what he was. Some men are the creatures of circumstance, but this is the exception and not the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3481"/>Men of sterling worth, are men of sterling principle, and we may expect to find in the character of our lamented chieftain, that which signalized him as <num value="1">one</num> worthy of pre-eminence among his countrymen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3482"/>Without being dogmatic, he was a man of <hi rend="italics">deep and sincere conviction</hi>. He thought for himself, and by sober reflection he matured these convictions upon which he was willing to construct his history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3483"/>When the idea of secession began to develop into a fact, he took his stand in opposition to it. Having canvassed the whole subject he pronounced it impractical if not unwarrantable, and to the end of his life this conviction was unchanged, but he saw no remedy but to fight, and his brilliant career as a soldier bears witness of his fidelity to an adopted duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3484"/>When led on by a sense of duty he feared no enemy, spared no friendship, realized no difficulties, and dreaded no consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3485"/>He was no disciple of utilitarianism, and scorned with an unutterable contempt every form of subterfuge and chicanery by which the mere interests of partisanship are secured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3486"/>Not only was he a man who acted upon honest and well-matured conviction, but there was born in his heart the truth that <q direct="unspecified">no man liveth unto himself.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3487"/>He acknowledged that mutual dependence that <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> exists among men, out of which grow the laws of a common brotherhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3488"/>This made him benevolent, this made him conservative, and this made him public-spirited.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3489"/>There was a time when his purse was full, and it was always at the command of a heart that was likewise full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3490"/>No man was ever turned from his door hungry, and his ear was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to catch the cry of distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3491"/>His was a benevolence that thought of no display&mdash;a concealed liberality, which, while it aided the unfortunate, kept the misfortune a secret.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3492"/>And I reveal only another phase of his benevolent spirit when I say he was <q direct="unspecified">conservative.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3493"/>Fanaticism was not born in him, and he fixed himself upon that form of justice, which, while it injured none, blessed all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>He was a man fitted to stand between opposing parties, and check the rage of party spirit set on fire by the excitement of doubtful contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>In the most heated political canvass ever prosecuted in his county, and in which he was elected by a majority of only <num value="2">two</num> votes, he exacted an agreement from his opponent to credit no slanderous or discreditable report until testified to in his own presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/>Perhaps there was no other virtue that so distinguished him as a leader, or to which he was more indebted for his well merited success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>It is remembered by some of you, how, that in your own streets he stood between the mob and its victim, until he concilitated the passions of men, and secured the triumph of law and order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>While he was unrelenting in his consciousness, and invincible in the discharge of his duty, yet he was as forgiving as a mother, and pursued the path of conciliation down to that point at which it became a wrong to go further.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>But, in order to complete an estimate of him as a citizen, I must not fail to mention his public-spiritedness&mdash;not a spirit, indeed, that was the new-born offspring of sudden occasion, but that grew out of the fact that he considered himself a member in the body politic, a joint of the great machinery that grinds out the people's progress and happiness; a spirit pure in its exercise, and <num value="1">one</num> that sprang from a combination of disinterestedness, integrity and true benevolence, and is the product of the formative influence of many domestic charities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>Some of you can recollect how promptly he came to the rescue, along with <persName n="Stamps,Judge,,,," id="n0268.0039.00244.02230" reg="mostcommon:Stamps,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Stamps</surname></persName>, <persName n="Maury,the Honorable,J.,H.,," id="n0268.0039.00244.02231" reg="default:Maury,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName> and others, when the great fire had destroyed almost the entire business part of your town, <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> and provided the means necessary to bridge over that almost fatal calamity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>And before I pass from this line of remark, I would not fail to pay a tribute to that innate modesty that so adorned his character, and I had almost said achieved his greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/>He shrank from the gaze of men. He invariably took the lowest seat until invited to go up higher; and his whole life has been a beautiful commentary on that word of holy Scripture which says: <q direct="unspecified">He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3503"/>His worth more appreciated by his fellow-citizens than by himself, he is by them brought forward and honored with the highest positions of confidence and trust that they could confer upon him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>During a transfer of a portion of the army with which he was connected in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 29" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, they came to a stream greatly swollen by continued rains, and upon his arrival he was invited to join in council with his superior officers, concerning the situation, as there was no time for delay and no means of bridging the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>Declining to counsel his superiors he simply requested that he be allowed to act at his discretion with his immediate command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>The permission was granted, he plunged into the threatening stream with orders for his men to follow, and in a few moments his brigade was safely over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>And immediately there went up a shout from the troops on the other side, applauding the daring but successful deed, and as soon as <persName n="Humphreys,General,,,," id="n0268.0039.00245.02232" reg="nearbymention:Humphreys,Benjamin,G.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Humphreys</surname></persName> discovered that he was the subject of such applause, he put spurs to his horse and was soon out of sight in the woodland, his modest spirit carrying him away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>And likewise when he united with the church he sought an occasion that would be free from all notoriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>It seemed that he had heard his Master say to him, as He so often said to those who sought His grace when on earth, <q direct="unspecified">See that thou tell it no man.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>Abundant in good deeds&mdash;the very synonym of charity, kindness and brotherly love&mdash;yet he would have scorned as unworthy and distasteful the publication of such acts, or the assumption of any merit on account of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>But nowhere, perhaps, did he manifest so clearly his power and wisdom as when called to the <name>Governorship</name> of his State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>It was a perilous time; the sound of arms had scarcely ceased its echo; all the disorganizing and demoralizing influences of war had to be met; a revolution had been affected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>Pre-existing institutions having been swept away, every fortune gone, and every home in mourning, a new beginning must be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>From every quarter there came the inquiry, <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> Who shall assume the leadership as we attempt to gather together the shattered pieces and rebuild?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>Where is there a man who can awaken hopefulness in the heart of the despairing, and at the same time check the heedless impetuosity of those maddened by defeat and restore their wrecked government to active and efficient service?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>The problem was solved by <num value="1">one</num> of your own boys when he suggested the name of <persName n="Humphreys,General,Benjamin,G.,," id="n0268.0039.00246.02233" reg="default:Humphreys,Benjamin,G.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName n="Benjamin">Benj.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Humphreys</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>At once all parties acknowleged his peculiar fitness, and as by acclamation he was made the custodian of the highest interests of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>And the success of his administration attests the wisdom of their choice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>His wise counsels, and his conservative measures, had brought again the reign of peace and prosperity&mdash;until he was called to meet a form of reconstruction, superinduced by the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>This he refused to do, regarding as sacred the trusts confided to his care, until at length, at the point of the bayonet, he was compelled to relinquish those trusts into the hands of strangers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>Leaving now civil life, in so many phases of which we find him conspicuous, I must speak of him as a <hi rend="italics">soldier</hi>. So varied was the form of his genius that he was at home in any field that demanded his service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>It cannot be expected that I should now give a detailed account of his military career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>This part of his life I must leave chiefly to the pen of the historian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>When he saw there was no alternative but to fight, he gave himself, with all the energy and sincerity of his nature, to the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>He raised a company, and became its <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>; he joined a regiment, and became its <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>; was assigned to a brigade, and became its commander.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>By nature he was singularly fitted as an official soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>He had courage without impetuosity, fidelity without ambition, and firmness without oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>Each soldier was his brother, and not <num value="1">one</num> should suffer when it was in his power to furnish relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>He participated in nearly all the hard-fought battles of his command, coming out of <num value="1">one</num> after having had <num value="2">two</num> horses shot from under him, and with <num value="9">nine</num> bullet holes through his cloak within a radius of <measure n="11inches" type="distance">eleven inches</measure> from his collar-button, and finally returned from the conflict bearing in his body <num value="4">four</num> severe wounds, that undermined his health and doubtless hastened his death.

<p>Other swords may be sheathed in scabbards of greater renown, but none in higher forms of valor and patriotism than his.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>But I must speak of him yet again as a man of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>He felt that his duty was but half done when he had served his fellowmen; he must serve his <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and Master too, and he responded to the claims of religion as he responded to all other duties, in no half-hearted service, but in a sincere and manly way.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>He loved the house of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; he loved the fellowship of good people; he loved his Saviour; and he loved to think and talk about that glory which through faith he was allowed to inherit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>As a citizen, he lives in the hearts of his friends-honored in life, and lamented in death.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>As a legislator and ruler, his people's praise is his monument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/><hi rend="italics">Comrades and Friends</hi>,&mdash;<measure n="21years" type="date">Twenty-one years</measure> ago, the body of men which has now dwindled down to what you now know as the <q direct="unspecified">Veteran Association,</q> left this city to gather dear experience in the tented field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>We had admired ourselves and each other in our gay uniforms, had felt our jackets swell with military ardor, had played at mimic war&mdash;delightful sensations, the heritage of all soldiers in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>What a pity they do not wear better when the mimicry stops and the reality begins!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>They did not go far with us. Take it altogether, we did not find war nearly as interesting as parades before our sweethearts and wives, or even as such occasions as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>I cannot attempt to tell you what we did find, but I hope we may be permitted to spend the balance of our time on the peace establishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>We thought we were doing our duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>It may have been an illusion, but nothing could have carried us through the work, which it is generally conceded we did grandly, if our hearts and <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> consciences had not been where we at least thought they ought to be. Some of us have never been able to get them in any other place to this day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>Now we are a very different body of men than we were <measure n="21years" type="date">twenty-one years</measure> ago. We are different&mdash;oh, how different&mdash;numerically!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>But we must draw a curtain over all that.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>After the war was over, the greater part of those who survived drifted back to New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>It was not long before we found that many of our poor fellows, either for themselves or for their families left in destitution, needed help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>In order to meet this want, which touched our hearts, we formed ourselves into the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName> Association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>We did not intend to recommence the war, or to hurt anybody, but the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> here at the time&mdash;I need not mention his name&mdash;must have been <q direct="unspecified">afraid,</q> for he ordered us to disband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>We obeyed as loyal citizens, but reorganized, leaving out the belligerent element in our name, and became the lamb-like Washington Benevolent Association, under which peaceful designation we did our work quite as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>We not only did a good deal for the living, but went on to erect some memorial of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>The monument which you all know so well is not what the gallant fellows deserve, but it is the best we could do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>Time has now closed up most of the sad gaps made by the war, and our work as a benevolent association is pretty near at an end, and so we have dropped that name and settled down into the military, but not dangerous title of <q direct="unspecified">Veteran Association.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/>Only a portion of the command was in this part of the engagement, and the enemy outnumbered us <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4730"/>Of this we were ignorant as they were on a hill, and hid by woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4731"/><num value="1">One</num> man in <num value="3">three</num>, of that band was either killed or wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4732"/>The writer advanced with the front rank until it was broken into a skirmish line, when each man sought what shelter he could, yet going forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4733"/>The idea that we should not drive the enemy was not entertained by the writer, hence, in his ardor, he did not hear the bugle-call retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4734"/>He was lying down with his head to the enemy, and some bushes between them loading his gun, when a ball passed under his shoulder and lodged at his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4735"/><q direct="unspecified">They are getting the range of you,</q> said a comrade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4736"/><q direct="unspecified">Yes, and I will leave here,</q> and that was the last he saw of his own men. Crossing a depression he lay down behind a log, replenished his cartridges, fired at the enemy <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> away, and then ran with an empty gun for some bushes a dozen yards distant to his right and forward, where he supposed his men were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4737"/><rs type="role" reg="Judge">Judge</rs> of his surprise to find, as he dropped down exhausted, men in butternut uniform.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4738"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression was that they were Union men driven in by the enemy; they had not seen him until he was near, and supposed that he was deserting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4739"/><num value="1">One</num> said to him, <q direct="unspecified">You are all right,</q> but he responded, <q direct="unspecified">I don't know about that.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4740"/>Another having hold of the muzzle of the prisoner's gun, said, <q direct="unspecified">Give me this gun.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4741"/><q direct="unspecified">I will,</q> was the reply, <q direct="unspecified">if you will take good care of it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4742"/>Another requested him to pass over his cartridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4743"/><q direct="unspecified">I have given you half <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> of them through the muzzle of my gun,</q> was the response as the prisoner unbuckled the strap, <q direct="unspecified">and if you had waited awhile longer I would have given you the rest.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4744"/>By this time the <rs>Confederates</rs> saw that the prisoner was not a deserter, and <num value="1">one</num> raised his gun as if to shoot, <q direct="unspecified">Hold on,</q> said the <rs>Lieutenant</rs>, the only officer there, <q direct="unspecified">He is my meat.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4745"/>To his intervention the writer considers his life due; his name was, if memory is correct, <persName n="McIlvain,,,,," id="n0268.0058.00332.03210" reg="mostcommon:McIlvain,nomatch:0"><surname>McIlvain</surname></persName>, of Liberty <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Va.</placeName>, <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> in the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA61">Sixty-First Virginia</orgName>. <q direct="unspecified">What do you want me for?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4747"/><q direct="unspecified">Oh, my sister wants a Yankee for a plaything.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4748"/><q direct="unspecified">What will she do with me.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4749"/><q direct="unspecified">She will put you up in a corner and spit tobacco juice in your eyes.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4750"/><q direct="unspecified">All right, I will stay there till the war is over.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4751"/>So jesting, they went back to the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs> in command of the regiment, who interrogated the prisoner as to the number of Union troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4752"/>The prisoner mentally multiplied them by as large a multiple as he thought they could stand, and answered accordingly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4753"/>The officer seemed satisfied, and led the prisoner to the <rs>Colonel</rs> in command of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4754"/>He was a perfect gentleman, and generously said to the prisoner, <q direct="unspecified">If you feel that in honor you ought not to tell me the truth, do not say anything.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4755"/></p> 
<p>The prisoner never blinked, and assented to the righteousness of that course and then lied to him outrageously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4756"/>Lied! What is called a mistake in a lady, a falsehood among the educated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4757"/>A lie by plain men is merely diplomacy in statesmanship and strategy in war. The prisoner strategized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4758"/>If he had told them the weakness of the <num value="2">two</num> regiments, with no <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, they could have thrown a line across the only road out of the village and captured the entire number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4759"/>Hence he said there were <num value="4000">4,000</num> in the village and <num value="10000">10,000</num> more below, about <num value="10000">10,000</num> too strong.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4760"/>That night the <rs>Union</rs> forces burned their commissary stores, and marched unmolested to the nearest reinforcements&mdash;<measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4761"/>The afternoon was spent by the prisoner in talking with officers about the war. They treated him well and endured some things which politeness should have kept him from saying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4762"/>A man was led past the group of officers with a look of intense pain on his features, and a bullet hole precisely in the middle of his forehead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4763"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> expressed his sympathy, and calling him by name, said, <q direct="unspecified">It will be an honorable wound if you get over it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4764"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">It would be if gained in an honorable cause,</q> said the prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4765"/><q direct="unspecified">It is an honorable cause,</q> said the officer emphatically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4766"/><q direct="unspecified">There's where we differ,</q> was the reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4767"/><pb id="p.333" n="333"/></p> 
<p>The next morning other prisoners were brought to face the writer with the question, <q direct="unspecified">How is it that your accounts differ so much; <num value="1">one</num> says <num value="4000">4,000</num>, the others <num value="1200">1,200</num> to <num value="1500">1,500</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4768"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prisoner, learning that the <rs>Union</rs> troops were gone, acknowledged the deception and told the reason of it. Some among the <rs>Confederates</rs> were for shooting him, some called him hard names, the only time he was insulted by soldiers, but others said he did right, and his life was in no danger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4769"/>The prisoners requested the privilege and were allowed to bury their dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/>They were then placed under guard in the jail, a stone building, where they remained for <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, during which time others were added to their number until there were about <measure n="100" type="prisoners">one hundred prisoners</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4771"/>This was but a meagre return for <num value="10000">10,000</num> men, and subsequently the writer saw in a Richmond paper that the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> had passed a vote of censure on the conduct of the campaign in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/>To that vote the writer may have contributed by his parsimonious use of the truth on the day of his capture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4773"/>The journey from <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Dublin Station">Dublin Station</placeName>, on the <orgName n="Tennessee and Virginia Railroad" type="railroad">Tennessee and Virginia railroad</orgName>, about <measure n="100miles" type="distance">100 miles</measure>, was made on foot, the guards riding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4774"/>At <placeName reg="Dublin Station">Dublin Station</placeName> we camped in a woody pasture, and <num value="2">two</num> wagons were driven up with provisions in the way of meal and pork, for the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4775"/>The writer had a companion with whom he messed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4776"/>This companion went to a wagon, about dusk, and drew rations for himself and his partner, he then went to the other wagon and repeated the heroic action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4777"/>The writer then went up and drew for <num value="2">two</num> also, and they spent the larger portion of the night in rustic cookery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4778"/>They had heard of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Libby,,Hotel,,,de" id="n0268.0058.00333.03211" reg="expanded:Libby,Hotel,,,"><foreName>Hotel</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Libby</surname></persName></hi>. The next day the journey was made on the cars to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4779"/>A number of Southern officers were on the train, who conversed with the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4780"/><num value="1">One</num>, a Major in the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA29">Twenty-Ninth Virginia</orgName>, sat down with the writer and they debated the question of the war keenly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4781"/>The possibility of being overcome by the <rs>North</rs> (this was in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>) he would not admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4782"/><q direct="unspecified">Then,</q> said the writer, <q direct="unspecified">will you, when you have gained your independence, allow the <rs>West</rs> to join your Confederacy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4783"/>Our interests are bound up with yours more than with <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4784"/><q direct="unspecified">No,</q> was the indignant answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4785"/><q direct="unspecified">You have tried to subjugate us, and we will have nothing to do with you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4786"/></p> 
<p>We concluded that the <rs>South</rs> would be harder to conquer than the <rs>North</rs> thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4787"/>He also told the writer that some ham, wine and other delicacies which had been sent from <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, directed <pb id="p.334" n="334"/> to <persName n="Moore,Colonel,A.,,," id="n0268.0058.00334.03212" reg="default:Moore,A.,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="OH28">Twenty-Eighth Ohio</orgName>, had, at the <rs n="Battle of Princeton" type="battle">battle of Princeton</rs>, fallen, unopened, into the hands of <persName n="Moore,Colonel,A.,,," id="n0268.0058.00334.03213" reg="default:Moore,A.,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA28">Twenty-Eighth Virginia</orgName>, and the latter <persName n="Moore,Colonel,,,," id="n0268.0058.00334.03214" reg="nearbymention:Moore,A.,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName> presuming that they were intended for him, had appropriated them with thanks to his unknown <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/>The next day the ride was in freight cars fitted up with seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4789"/>A number of canteens belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Army were promptly appropriated by the prisoners as relics of the invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4790"/>Alas! they never left Dixie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>When the train reached <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, by some misunderstanding, we were marched up past the <rs>Capitol</rs> and around to our destination, marching into <placeName reg="Libby, Cleburne, Arkansas" key="tgn,2446819">Libby</placeName> after dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4792"/><q direct="unspecified">Pass up your canteens,</q> was the order, and the thirsty souls passed up every canteen, not knowing that water ran from a hydrant, and that was to be our last sight of the canteens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4793"/>In <placeName reg="Libby, Cleburne, Arkansas" key="tgn,2446819">Libby</placeName> we sang and enjoyed ourselves as best we could.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4794"/>Every day we fell into ranks and were counted before rations were given out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4795"/>As to food, it was too delicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4796"/>To tell the square truth, we were not satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4797"/>The complaint was not that it was not good, it was only of its scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/><num value="2">Two</num> meals a day were fashionable when we went there, and we readily fell in with the fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4799"/>Not to eat till <time value="11am">11 A. M.</time> was the custom of the majority, and we were suddenly convinced that it was the best plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4800"/>Another slight repast at <num value="5">five</num> completed our attention to the gross act of eating, and we were ready for whatever else could take up our time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4801"/>The regiment to which the writer belonged wore the <rs>Zouave</rs> uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4802"/>In passing through a little town on our march to the railroad, a generous citizen had given <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">twenty-five dollars</measure> for our little party, this we were now allowed to spend for food, though it could not purchase much.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4803"/>For a week every day had new reports of what was to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>Unlike the statesmen of the hostile sections, who were constantly thrown into the provoking conflicts of political debate, he had been withdrawn by his military occupations from scenes calculated to irritate or chill his kindly feelings toward the people of the <rs>North</rs>; and on the contrary&mdash;in camp, and field, and social circle&mdash;he had formed many ties of friendship with its most esteemed soldiers and citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5640"/>Regarding the figure as a sculptural achievement, when it was exhibited in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> we wrote, after careful study of it, the following criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5641"/>These impressions are now, to our mind, more than confirmed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5642"/>The figure is over life-size, and rests upon a heavily-draped couch in an attitude of easy repose, the head being elevated to a natural position, with the face turned slightly to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5643"/>The feet are lightly crossed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5644"/>The right forearm lies across the breast&mdash;the hand holding by simple weight the blanket which covers the lower part of the body&mdash;while the left arm is fully extended along the couch; this hand touches the hilt of a sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5645"/>In its minutest details the work exhibits the closest artistic study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5646"/>In the drapery of the couch, every fold of which is rich, heavy and graceful, the swelling contour of the limbs beneath the blanket, the naturalness of the position, the chaste elaboration of the sword hilt, we have a musical scale of harmony and the legend of a poetic mind, looking perhaps to the austere and philosophic for the beautiful, but developing it so as to impress the most casual, nevertheless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5647"/>Of the faithfulness of the portraiture it is not necessary to speak&mdash;that is conceded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5648"/>It is with the idealization as embodied in the expression we have to deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5649"/>It is not death&mdash;it can hardly be termed sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5650"/>Though the eyes are closed there is the light of a noble soul existence visible, irreconcilable with either life or death, but not inconsistent with the art principle that reverences the genius of grandeur, no matter what its form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5651"/>The artist has aimed at grandeur, true and pure, and has reflected the rays of the <name>German</name> <pb id="p.401" n="401"/> school in which his education in plastic art was obtained&mdash;the school to which <persName n="Rauch,,,,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03720" reg="mostcommon:Rauch,nomatch:0"><surname>Rauch</surname></persName> is indebted for his style, and which was kept alive by Rietschel at <placeName reg="Dresden, Weakley, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098870">Dresden</placeName>, <persName n="Drake,,,,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03721" reg="mostcommon:Drake,James,H.,,:1"><surname>Drake</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wolff,,Albert,,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03722" reg="default:Wolff,Albert,,,"><foreName>Albert</foreName> <surname>Wolff</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, and Blaeser at <placeName key="tgn,7004446" n="1.000 3" reg="koln,koln,nordrhein-westfalen,deutschland,europe">Cologne</placeName>&mdash;whose influence was felt by <persName n="Schadow,,,,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03723" reg="mostcommon:Schadow,nomatch:0"><surname>Schadow</surname></persName> and Schwanthaler, and whose disciple at <placeName key="tgn,7003474" n="1.000 2" reg="kobenhavn,kobenhavn,danmark,europe">Copenhagen</placeName> was Bessen, and at <persName n="Galli,,Rome,Pierre,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03724" reg="default:Galli,Rome,Pierre,,"><foreName>Rome</foreName> <foreName>Pierre</foreName> <surname>Galli</surname></persName> and others&mdash;the school that really drew its inspiration from the genius of Thorvaldsen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5652"/>Taking the figure in its whole proportions, <persName n="Valentine,Mister,,,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03725" reg="nearbymention:Valentine,Edward,Virginius,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Valentine</surname></persName> has resorted to none of the artifices of art; and while <num value="1">one</num> may not feel so quickly touched by it-speaking in the accepted aesthetical sense as opposed to the idea of being impressed&mdash;its eminent beauties constantly reveal themselves by study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5653"/>A celebrated sculptor, in comparing <persName n="Canova,,,,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03726" reg="mostcommon:Canova,nomatch:0"><surname>Canova</surname></persName> and Thorvaldsen, once said that before <persName n="Canova,,,,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03727" reg="mostcommon:Canova,nomatch:0"><surname>Canova</surname></persName>'s work he was always on the defensive, fearing that his judgment might be taken captive by the excessive airs and grace of the figures and by the extreme skilfulness of the execution, which often conceal faults, and which were neither natural nor antique.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5654"/>With Thorvaldsen, on the contrary, he continues: <q direct="unspecified">I do not fear any such artifices; my mind is tranquil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5655"/>I prefer him for his greater breadth of style and because his work is truer and more correct.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5656"/>To the artistic judgment in the abstract tranquility of mind is expressive of the feeling in gazing upon <persName n="Valentine,Mister,,,," id="n0268.0062.00401.03728" reg="nearbymention:Valentine,Edward,Virginius,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Valentine</surname></persName>'s creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5657"/>The breadth, purity, and truth of modelling is that of an artist who does not fear his own conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5658"/>His ambition was of the most exalted character, and he searched for his ideal in a field of art where the dividing line between success and failure is so exact as to render the ground treacherous and the undertaking dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5659"/>Between the extremes of the mediaeval and the modern sarcophaghi, it is true, there is a wide difference, but the art movement involved in the present undertaking was not strictly to be found in the intermediate ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5660"/>The contact was between an antique principle reflected through the solid grandeur of the <name>German</name> intellectualism in sculpture and an immense deal of originality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5661"/>Had he failed to find it his failure would have been complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5662"/>That he has not failed, but has achieved a most wonderful triumph, we believe will be the best art judgment in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5663"/>Leaving the abstract artistic question of the merits of the figure, we can say little more of it without repeating ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5664"/>The most casual observer must, upon viewing it, be filled with a solemnity touched with awe; must feel that it is the creation of a great genius; that it is a noble effort in art. It appeals to the strongest sense of reverence, and has made the reputation of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 29" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s sculptor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5665"/><pb id="p.402" n="402"/></p> 
<p>The position of the work in the mausoleum throws the head to the north, with the face turned slightly toward the chapel, thus affording a view of it from a number of different points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5666"/>It is impossible to imagine greater architectural and sculptural harmony.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5667"/>We add the conclusion of a long and very appreciative article written by the <name>Art</name> critic of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Boston Post" type="newspaper">Boston Post</orgName></hi>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5668"/></p> 
<p>The writer was favored with a sight of it [the plaster cast] in <persName n="Valentine,Mister,,,," id="n0268.0062.00402.03729" reg="nearbymention:Valentine,Edward,Virginius,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Valentine</surname></persName>'s studio at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName>, several months ago, and the impression then gained was very favorable to its excellent qualities as a work of art. The figure is full length, reclining upon the back on a couch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5669"/>The likeness is said by those who knew <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0268.0062.00402.03730" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> intimately to be exceptionably good, and it certainly is faithful to the best portraits of him now extant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5670"/>The pose of the figure is firm, and yet is so happily devoid of hardness that it is quite easy and natural, and suggests the idea of calm slumber more clearly than such work is wont to do. The drapery thrown over the figure and across the couch is admirably handled with the utmost grace and simplicity in its folds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5671"/>This quality of simplicity and directness is the strong feature in the work as a whole.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5672"/>There is a great deal of the pure <rs>Greek</rs> in <persName n="Valentine,Mister,,,," id="n0268.0062.00402.03731" reg="nearbymention:Valentine,Edward,Virginius,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Valentine</surname></persName>'s art sense, and we find it strongly manifested in this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5673"/>There are no meretricious ornaments in the way of decorations, nothing of the <quote>catchy</quote> character, but plain, simple, straightforward and intelligent methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5674"/>This work is thoroughly simple and severe, and quite classic in character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5675"/>In the hands of an artist of lesser power these qualities so pronounced might easily have degenerated into hardness and coldness, but it is not so here, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5676"/>They add a dignity and an impressiveness to the subject that eminently befit and elevate it to a higher position among the best of our native works of sculpture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5677"/>It is a triumph in art that the sculptor may well be proud of, and which must be thoroughly satisfactory to every admirer of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0268.0062.00402.03732" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5849"/>This friendship begun in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, was cemented up to the time that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0268.0063.00417.04005" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> resigned his commission and accepted the command of the <rs>Virginia</rs> forces, and remained unbroken until the death of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0268.0063.00417.04006" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Winfield,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5852"/>It was not only written without any expectation of its ever being published, but the writer even took the precaution to say to the loved brother, whom he playfully addressed as <q direct="unspecified">My Darling Rose,</q> that <q direct="unspecified">this is intended only for your eyes.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5853"/>And yet it will be seen that this rising young officer, writing with all the freedom of brotherly confidence, not only does not seek to exalt himself by detracting from the merits of his chief, but modestly pushes aside the personal fame he had so justly won that <pb id="p.418" n="418"/> he might pay the tribute of admiring friendship to his loved General.</p>

<p>Your commendations upon the conduct of the army in this war has filled me with pleasure; they justly deserve it. There was no danger too great for them to seek and no labor too severe for them to undertake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5856"/>The fall of a comrade did not retard a single step, but all pressed forward to their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5857"/>Better soldiers never died on any field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5858"/>Nor has the navy been behind them in their duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5859"/>They have risked every exposure and every disease, have served on land with as much alacrity as on shipboard, have captured every port they could reach, and now hold the whole coast closely blockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5860"/>They have only lacked the opportunities afforded to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5861"/>I think our country may well be proud of the conduct of both arms of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5862"/>As to myself, your brotherly feelings have made you estimate too highly my small services, and though praise from <num value="1">one</num> I love so dearly is very sweet, truth compels me to disclaim it. I did nothing more than what others in my place would have done much better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5863"/>The great cause of our success was in our leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5864"/>It was his stout heart that cast us on the shore of <placeName reg="Veracruz, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005599">Vera Cruz</placeName>; his bold self-reliance that forced us through the pass of <placeName key="tgn,2098347;tgn,2074016" n="0.068 000000.1364	placename;tgn,2098347;cerro gordo, hardin, tennessee,Hardin,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.1364	placename;tgn,2074016;cerro gordo, columbus, north carolina,Columbus,North Carolina,United States,North and Central America" reg="cerro gordo, hardin, tennessee,Hardin,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;cerro gordo, columbus, north carolina,Columbus,North Carolina,United States,North and Central America">Cerro Gordo</placeName>; his indomitable courage that, amid all the doubts and difficulties that surrounded us at <placeName key="tgn,7007118" n="1.000 1" reg="puebla,puebla,mexico,north and central america">Puebla</placeName>, pressed us forward to this <name>Capitol</name>, and finally brought us within its gates, while others, who croaked all the way from <placeName reg="Double Mountain Fork Brazos River, Texas, United States" key="tgn,2293436">Brazos</placeName>, advised delay at <placeName key="tgn,7007118" n="1.000 1" reg="puebla,puebla,mexico,north and central america">Puebla</placeName>, finding themselves at last, contrary to their expectations, comfortably quartered within the city, find fault with the way they came there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5865"/>With all their knowledge I will defy them to have done better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5866"/>I agree with you in your opinion of these dissensions in camp; they have clouded a bright campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5867"/>It is a contest in which neither party has anything to gain and the army much to lose, and ought to have been avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5868"/>The whole matter will soon be before the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, and if it be seen that there has been harshness and intemperance of language on <num value="1">one</num> side, it will be evident that there has been insubordination on the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5869"/>It is difficult for a General to maintain discipline in an army composed as this is in a foreign country, where the temptations to disorders are so great and the chance of detection so slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5870"/>He requires every support and confidence from his government at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5871"/>If he abuses his trust or authority it is then time to hold him to <pb id="p.419" n="419"/> account; but to decide the matter upon an ex-parte statement of favorites, to suspend a successful General in command of an army in the heart of an enemy's country, to try the judge in place of the accused, is to upset all discipline, to jeopardize the safety of the army and the honor of the country, and to violate justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5872"/>I trust, however, that all will work well in the end.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5873"/>I had strong hopes of peace on the basis of the project of the treaty submitted by the <rs>Mexican Government</rs>, of which you have learned through the papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5875"/>But the discussions in Congress and speeches of some of our leading men are calculated so to confuse the public mind here that it may encourage them to delay and procrastinate in the hope that the plan of withdrawing the army, no indemnity, etc., may be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5877"/>It is rather late in the day to discuss the origin of the war (that ought to have been understood before we engaged in it). It may have been produced by the act of either party or the force of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5878"/>Let the pedants in diplomacy determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5879"/>It is certain that we are the victors in a regular war, continued, if not brought on, by their obstinacy and ignorance, and they are whipped in a manner of which women might be ashamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5880"/>We have the right by the laws of war of dictating the terms of peace and requiring indemnity for our losses and expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6046"/>The disease with which my stock have died seems to be an epidemic catarrh; known to be fatal unless the proper remedies are employed to check it, which remedies cannot be employed in the army for want of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6047"/>This disease was produced by the want of feed and the bad condition of what we did get, and the horses in the condition naturally produced by this bad feed, being then exposed to the very severe weather experienced a few weeks back, were in the very state to be afflicted with this fatal malady, and hence the result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6072"/><rs type="role2">Major</rs>,&mdash;I respectfully submit for your consideration a few facts in regard to the feed furnished the stock of this battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6073"/>I <pb id="p.436" n="436"/> have been in the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Tennessee army</orgName> since last <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> and can truly say during the whole of that time the stock of my command has not been half fed. In some instances the horses going for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> at a time without anything to eat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6074"/>Full rations of corn and <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of fodder, sometimes, (bad at that) in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6075"/>I have just received a good lot of horses, which I cannot keep in condition unless I get something to feed them on. I have my horses as well groomed and otherwise cared for as can be, but good grooming and other necessary attention will not feed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6076"/>Corn alone will not keep horses in condition; they will not eat rations of corn if no long feed is furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6077"/>Horses fed with corn alone are more liable to disease, and in fact cannot be kept healthy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6078"/>It is a shame to drain the country of horses and then starve them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6079"/>It cripples the resources of the country without any good, which no <num value="1">one</num> has a right to do. If this system of starvation was unavoidable I would not complain, but when the whole of <rs type="direction">middle</rs> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Georgia</placeName> is full of fodder, the tax in kind actually rotting along the line of the principal railroad accessible to the army, what reason is there that feed cannot be furnished in abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6080"/>I have seen with my own eyes hundreds and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of bales of good fodder actually rotting for want of attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6081"/>Where's the fault?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6082"/>The quarter-masters say short transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6083"/>This cannot be, for if it be so, then it is an acknowledgment at once that the <rs>Grand</rs> <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName> cannot be fed. Is it absolutely necessary in order to feed this army to have a railroad?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6084"/>Pshaw! How were armies fed before the day of railroads?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6097"/>I did not know before that it was even proper, much less my duty to report direct to you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6098"/>I also reported to him several times that if the battalion received no more forage for its stock, that it could not move in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6099"/>I at last <pb id="p.438" n="438"/> reported to him on Saturday that our battery could not move, and that there was not a battery in the command that could make a day's march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6101"/>This is my defence, and if any <num value="1">one</num> has made more strenuous exertion to prevent the government from starving its own stock, I would like to know who he is. The threat from an officer occupying the position that you do, that we shall not have any more horses when we lose what we have, may be all right, it is not for me to say, I simply say this, that I hope we will <hi rend="italics">not</hi> get any more unless they can be better fed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6271"/>I believe it is particularly what I saw and heard from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0268.0070.00451.04443" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> at the commencement of the late war, in the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, as illustrating his <pb id="p.452" n="452"/> moderation and elevation of sentiment under the most trying circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6272"/>As soon as it was made public that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 29" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had passed the ordinance of secession, of course there was the greatest excitement in the public mind in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 29" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6273"/>The <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName> was still in session when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0268.0070.00452.04444" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> came from <placeName reg="Old Washington, Mason, Kentucky" key="tgn,2558074">Washington</placeName>, and it was announced to him that he had been elected <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the <rs>Virginia</rs> troops, which were then being called into service as rapidly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6274"/>Of course, among people who knew nothing from actual experience of what war was, many extreme ideas prevailed, and many extreme measures were proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6275"/>The <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">military committee</orgName> of the convention held daily sessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6276"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0268.0070.00452.04445" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was frequently invited to appear before that committee for advice and counsel, as to what was best to be done in regard to the various measures suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6277"/>He always seemed from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to have a thorough appreciation of the gravity, and even solemnity of the situation, and I remember upon <num value="1">one</num> occasion especially, when it was proposed to seize the coasting vessels which were in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 29" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> waters as being the property of aliens and enemies, he was consulted, and I never shall forget the earnest and solemn manner with which he warned those around him that they were just on the threshold of a long and bloody war, and advised them if they had any idea that the contest in which they were about to engage was to be a slight <num value="1">one</num>, to dismiss all such thoughts from their minds, saying that he knew the <rs>Northern</rs> people well, and knew that they never would yield in that contest except at the conclusion of a long and desperate struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6278"/>He urged the committee that it was of the last importance that the <rs>South</rs> should so conduct herself in the struggle as to attract to herself the respect and sympathy of the civilized nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6279"/>Going on to apply the same thought to the matter then in hand, he said that there was no amount of mere individual suffering which could be inflicted that could add to the public good; that if we should seize these coasting vessels without warning, it would be a matter of doubtful propriety, and inflict ruin upon the owners, without adding strength to our own cause or making friends with the outside world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6280"/>His whole influence throughout all the eventful scenes of the war was in the direction of moderation and humanity, and highest principles of modern civilized warfare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6281"/>I saw him again upon another occasion, which will be of lifelong interest to me, when his purity and singular unselfishness of character were strikingly exhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6282"/>In the winter of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">4</year></dateStruct>, if my <pb id="p.453" n="453"/> memory serves me, when <placeName><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0268.0070.00453.04446" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName> were near <placeName reg="Orange Courthouse, Virginia">Orange Courthouse, Virginia</placeName>, I was directed by <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0268.0070.00453.04447" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:14"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> to go to the <rs>General</rs> and to urge upon him to recommend his distinguished son, <persName n="Lee,General,Custis,,," id="n0268.0070.00453.04448" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, to an important command, for which <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0268.0070.00453.04449" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:14"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> thought him admirably fitted, but to which he could not assign him without the recommendation of his father, who was in chief command of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6283"/>I went to him and spent several hours in his tent at night talking over the importance of the command to which it was desired that <persName n="Lee,General,Custis,,," id="n0268.0070.00453.04450" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> should be assigned, and delivered to him messages which had been sent by <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0268.0070.00453.04451" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:14"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> upon the subject, and urged him by every consideration which I could think of to comply with the <rs>President</rs>'s wishes as to the recommendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6284"/><persName n="Lee,General,Custis,,," id="n0268.0070.00453.04452" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was recognized as <num value="1">one</num> of the most distinguished graduates sent out from <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and a man of high attainments, great ability, and with a character very much resembling that of his distinguished father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6285"/>But I could make no impression upon the <rs>General</rs>, and the only answer which I could get from him, and which he reiterated at different times in the conversation, when I would urge the <rs>President</rs>'s wishes, was <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Lee,General,Custis,,," id="n0268.0070.00453.04453" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is my son, and whilst I think very well of his abilities, yet, in my opinion, he has not been sufficiently tried in the field, and because he is my son, and because of his want of sufficient experience in the field, I cannot and I will not recommend him for the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6286"/>You may return and say to the <rs>President</rs> that I recognize the importance of the position to which he refers, and that I am willing to send to that command any other officer here with my army whom he may designate, however valuable that officer is, or may be, to to me in my present position.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6287"/></p> 
<p>Of course I may not, after this lapse of time, give you his exact language, but I think that I have very nearly done so, for I remember how deep an impression the interview made upon me. So it was throughout his whole career, with a purity of life, elevation of sentiment, and dignity of manner which seemed to raise him high above the plain of common humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6288"/>Of his great abilities as a chieftain, of course, it is the province of history to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6289"/>You only ask me to give you my personal reminiscences of the man upon the <num value="2">two</num> occasions to which I have referred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6290"/>It was my singular good fortune to have seen much of him during the war, and afterwards, when he devoted his great talents to the training of Southern youth as a president of <orgName n="Washington College" type="college">Washington College</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6291"/>When looking back now at him, as I knew him, after the lapse of all these years, I say <pb id="p.454" n="454"/> that he was the greatest and the purest and the most elevated man, in all that goes to make up true humanity, whom I have ever seen or ever expect to see.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6298"/>We are not surprised, then, to find his book a repository of data of the greatest value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6299"/>The narrative is very clear, concise, and fair in spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6300"/>It is too crowded, and written too much, perhaps, in the style of an official report, to be entertaining to the casual reader; but its interest to the student of the great campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> can hardly be exaggerated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6301"/>This campaign was incomparably the greatest of the civil war. In the desperate daily struggle, unintermitted for months, in the unparalleled number of fierce battles, in the terrible destruction of life, in the magnitude of the issues at stake, and of the results determined by it, no campaign can compare with it. The history of it, when fully written, will constitute a splendid tribute to the courage and endurance of both armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6302"/>This history, too, will bear witness to the qualities of the leaders of those armies&mdash;to the determined perseverance, the obstinate tenacity of purpose, the coolness and firmness in the presence of defeat, that characterized the successful General whom his countrymen have ever since delighted to honor, not more than to the boldness, the sagacity, the fertility of resource, <pb id="p.455" n="455"/> the consummate skill which have placed the defeated commander on the roll of great captains.</p>

Yet the <num value="15000">15,000</num> men who lay secure behind the dirt lines, and the still greater number who lay outside, felt the result of the eternal vigilance of the few scientific men who, in season and out of season, gave unity and design to the labors of the noble soldiers whose rest was little in that unfortunate city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6741"/>A few days before the termination of the attack upon <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> the vanity of a Major of artillery, who because of seniority was the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">chief of artillery</rs> on the line, caused me a narrow escape from the <q direct="unspecified">sudden death</q> that the church reminds us every Sunday to pray against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6746"/>The night preceding the surrender was the darkest I ever saw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6748"/>The post of danger being there, I literally felt my way over the sleeping soldiers, giving and taking impatient exclamations until I reached the stockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6750"/>On my knees, <pb id="p.487" n="487"/> and with ear to the ground I listened for the sappers and miners as they, mole-like were running passages under the breastworks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6751"/>To my gratification I found that they were still about <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> from our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6752"/>I went to the sap of <num value="1">one</num> of the mines and looked down on a private passing back dirt from the mine, but not caring to make closer acquaintance, I deftly backed out and landed on our side of <persName n="Jordan,,,,," id="n0268.0078.00487.04834" reg="mostcommon:Jordan,G.,,,:2"><surname>Jordan</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/>The <num value="9">nine</num> mines the <rs>Yankees</rs> were working in had got so far along that I put my details to work cutting a deep ditch (at the end next our works) at right angles to their direction with the object of making the line of least resistance upwards through the ditch instead of under the stockaded breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>And, after doing this, still having time I commenced making a counter mine over each of these mines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6755"/>So close and so loud was the sound of the miners' work that it was with difficulty I could keep the men at work, only doing so by making frequent changes of men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6756"/>This was the end of the extraordinary wise movement to prevent the opening of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6757"/>It was a death blow to the unity of action of the southern armies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7190"/>Soon after reaching there, the other brigades being put in motion, it fell into the position previously assigned it as the rear brigade of the division, and moved noiselessly and in good order to the north side of <placeName key="tgn,2197176" n="1.000 10" reg="Broward River, Duval, Florida">Cedar Creek</placeName>, on the road&mdash;&mdash;, where, just after daybreak, it rapidly formed in line of battle, and pushed forward at once in support of the other brigades of the division, then advancing on the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7191"/>On clearing the dense and tangled woods immediately in our front, and reaching the open, elevated ground occupied by the enemy (understood to be <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Crook,,,,," id="n0268.0084.00520.05261" reg="mostcommon:Crook,nomatch:0"><surname>Crook</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>), it was discovered that <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Bryan,,,,," id="n0268.0084.00520.05262" reg="mostcommon:Bryan,nomatch:0"><surname>Bryan</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, by a most brilliant dash, had already succeeded in driving them out, and held possession of their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7193"/>From this point the brigade steadily advanced to the left of, and on a line nearly parallel to, the pike, as far as the lane which led into the pike, and passing near a house said to have been the headquarters of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs> of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7194"/>Beyond this lane, some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure>, the enemy had rallied, apparently with the determination of making an effort to check our advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7195"/>And as <num value="1">one</num> of my regiments, in consequence of the inequalities of the ground over which we had passed, had become detached, the brigade was halted a few minutes until it could resume its proper place in the line.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7197"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> commanding rode up at this time, and by his order the command was moved <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure> to the right in the direction of the turnpike, and the forward movement again resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7198"/>After proceeding some distance, the troops on our right having halted, this brigade was halted also, and my skirmishers, together with those of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Bryan,,,,," id="n0268.0084.00521.05265" reg="mostcommon:Bryan,nomatch:0"><surname>Bryan</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, advanced to clear the woods of a body of the enemy's skirmishers in front of my left, which was handsomely done, when the line again moved forward and occupied a road <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile distant</measure> in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7199"/>Here the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">Third</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 15">Fifteenth regiments</orgName>, which had been temporarily detached, rejoined us, and were sent to the right to fill up a gap between this brigade and that of <persName n="Humphreys,,,,," id="n0268.0084.00521.05266" reg="mostcommon:Humphreys,Benjamin,G.,,:5"><surname>Humphreys</surname></persName>'s.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7204"/>Up to this time both officers and men had obeyed with commendable cheerfulness and alacrity all orders, but unfortunately, in moving to the rear, a very high fence was encountered, and in clearing it my line was necessarily broken, and being without a staff officer, or courier, and my horse being shot under me, before it could be reformed a stream of flying fugitives from other commands became so mixed up with my men, infecting the latter with their own fears, that they soon became oblivious of every thing save an earnest desire to leave the enemy as far in the rear as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7327"/>Old friends stood by us and new ones have rallied to our help&mdash;so that we are enabled now to report that we have regularly issued our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>, paid <measure n="2600dollars" type="currency">$2,600</measure> on account of old debt, reprinted missing numbers to make complete sets at a cost of <measure n="726.50dollars" type="currency">$726.50</measure>, expended <hi rend="italics"></hi><measure n="734.53dollars" type="currency">$734.53</measure> on account of extra binding and other necessary extra expenses; and are still able to report <measure n="4633.42dollars" type="currency">$4,633.42</measure> deposited in the <orgName n="Savings Bank" type="bank">savings bank</orgName> to the credit of our special fund, besides <measure n="255.19dollars" type="currency">$255.19</measure> due it by our current fund.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7328"/>Besides these important pecuniary results, the canvass we have made has extended the knowledge of our work over a large territory where it was before comparatively unknown&mdash;added largely to our membership, raised us up active friends, secured most valuable material for our archives, and given promise of much larger results in the future.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7330"/>We have continued to receive from every quarter&mdash;from the <rs>North</rs> and from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, as well as from leading Confederates&mdash;the most gratifying assurances of the interest and value of these <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>, while we are gradually placing full sets of them on the shelves of the prominent public and private libraries of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7331"/>The action of the great <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">State of Texas</placeName> in purchasing <num value="160">one hundred and sixty</num> sets for <pb id="p.532" n="532"/> distribution in the counties of the <rs>State</rs> must have a happy effect in inducing other States to follow her example, and in calling the attention of private collectors to their value.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7333"/>It is very gratifying to note the frequency with which writers on any part of the war quote from our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>, and to see how they are modifying the views and correcting many of the errors of even Northern historians, while they are making an impression in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as surprising as it is gratifying to all who desire to see vindicated the truth of Confederate history.</p>
