<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>the following pages contain the substance of Lectures on the subject of Domestic Slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which for several years have been delivered to the classes in Moral Science in <orgName n="Randolph Macon College" type="college">Randolph Macon College</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Since the year <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>, I have been frequently called on to discuss this subject on various popular occasions in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>My classes in college were compelled to deal with the subject of domestic slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Not only the popular ideas in regard to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery in this country, but the specific treatment of this topic by numerous text authors in Moral Science, rendered this unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>A deep conviction that the minds of young men were receiving a wrong, and, in the present state of the country, a fatal direction, <pb n="viii"/>both as regards the principles of the institution, and the institution itself, induced me to substitute the text authorities on the subject by a course of lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>These lectures, therefore, were originally drawn up with a view to oral delivery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They were modified by the circumstances of their origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In preparing them for the press, however, I was led to consider the class of persons for whose use they were chiefly designed, and at the same time to adapt them as far as possible to the general reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I was aware of the difficulty of fixing definitely on the mind of the student the nature and limits of abstract truths, and that this difficulty is, if any thing, greatly increased when we pass to those whose reading is not characterized by habits of thought,--as would be the case with many of those whose interest in the general subject of slavery might induce them to read these lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The task of meeting these difficulties was encountered with a measure of painful distrust.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>My views on the subject of slavery, as a practical question, will be found very generally to accord with the popular ideas of those communities <pb n="ix"/>in which the <name>African</name> population chiefly resides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>But, as a question of Moral Science, I will be found to differ, and in some aspects very materially, from those who have spoken and written on the subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The closing lecture is on the duties of masters to slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>On this point it may also appear that my views do not accord with those of some others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>There are men whose views I judge to be entirely too loose on the whole subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But I should consider any treatise on the subject of slavery as inexcusably defective that did not embrace the duties of masters to slaves; and I persuade myself that the number, if any, who take a different view of the subject will be found to be exceedingly small.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Whether I have acted wisely in endeavoring to combine in <num value="1">one</num> performance a treatise adapted to the habits of the student, and at the same time to the habits of the general reader; and whether I have succeeded to any desirable extent in so difficult an undertaking, it is not for me to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I can only say, that in giving these lectures to the public, I have yielded to the earnest desire, often <pb n="x"/>expressed, of a large number of friends whose judgment is entitled to my highest respect and confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In meeting their wishes, I have endeavored to do justice to the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I have written honestly, and with a sincere desire to do good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>For the many imperfections of this volume, the author persuades himself that the assurance that it has been written and prepared for the press under the pressure of other important and frequently distracting avocations, will be received as some apology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In the humble hope that it may, nevertheless, shed some light on the difficulties of the general subject, and thereby contribute to diffuse sounder views on the principles involved, quiet the irritation of the public mind, and give more stability to our political union, and, at the same time, impress masters more deeply with the importance and obligations of their providential position, it is with diffidence submitted to the judgment of the public. </p></div1></front><body>

<item>Why this discussion may be regarded as humiliating by Southern people</item> 
<item>other stand-points, however, disclose an urgent necessity, at this time, for a thorough investigation of the whole subject</item> 
<item>the results to which it is the object of these lectures to conduct the mind.</item></list></p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>the great question which arises in discussing the slavery of the <name>African</name> population of this country &mdash; correctly known as <quote>Domestic slavery</quote> --is this: <hi rend="italics">Is the institution of domestic slavery sinful</hi>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The position I propose to maintain in these lectures is, that slavery, <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>, is right; or that <pb id="p.12" n="12"/>the great abstract principle of slavery is right, because it is a fundamental principle of the social state; and that domestic slavery, as an <hi rend="italics">institution</hi>, is fully justified by the condition and circumstances (essential and relative) of the <name>African</name> race in this country, and therefore equally right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I confess that it is somewhat humiliating to discuss the question enunciated &mdash; Is the institution of domestic slavery sinful?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The affirmative assumes that an immense community of Southern people, of undoubted piety, are, nevertheless, involved in great moral delinquency on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This is a palpable absurdity in regard to a great many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>For nothing is more certain than this, that if it be sinful, they either know it, or are competent to know it, and hence are responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>And as no plea of necessity can justify an enlightened man in committing known sin, it follows that all such Southern people are highly culpable, which is utterly inconsistent with the admission that they are pious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>To say, as some are accustomed to do, that <quote>slavery is certainly wrong in the <hi rend="italics">abstract</hi>,</quote> that is, in plain terms, in itself sinful, but that they cannot help themselves, appears to me to be wholly unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It assumes that a man may be absolutely compelled to commit sin. This certainly cannot be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>All candid minds will readily allow, that so far as <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>Deity has yet explained himself, he has in no instance enjoined upon man the observance of any principle as his duty, which he may be compelled, in the order of his providence, to violate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is equally false in fact, for it is not true that we are absolutely compelled to be slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If government be, as it undoubtedly is, the agent of the people, and the people choose, they are certainly competent by this agent to free themselves from this institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>True, the immense cost of such an enterprise would be the least in the catalogue of evils resulting from it; for the total ruin of the <name>African</name> race in this country may be put down among the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But what of all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Nothing can justify an enlightened and civilized people in committing sin. No; not even the sacrifice of life itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Withal, if the civil society refuse to make so costly a sacrifice to avoid sin, there is nothing that can compel any individual citizen to remain a slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He can live in the community, as some do, without even hiring or owning a slave; or he can remove to <num value="1">one</num> of the so-called free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We should give no countenance, therefore, to any such mere attempts to <hi rend="italics">apologize</hi> for domestic slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The conduct of bad men may sometimes find apologists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The conduct of good men always admits <hi rend="italics">of defence</hi>. Hence, with many others, I have often been <pb id="p.14" n="14"/>grieved by the repeated attempts of certain pseudo-friends to pass off this flimsy and ridiculous apology as an able defence of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In maintaining the institution of domestic slavery, we are either right or wrong, in a moral point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We ask no mere apology on the score of necessity, and we can certainly claim none on the ground of ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Those who affirm that we are wrong, directly attack our morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>In doing this, they arraign the character of many <num value="1000">thousands</num>, who are among the most civilized and pious people now living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>This fact alone is a sufficient refutation of so foul an aspersion; and in this view, it may be readily admitted that any attempt at a more formal refutation is a humiliating condescension, to which few Southern men can willingly submit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But there is another stand-point from which this subject is to be viewed, and which reflects it in a very different light, and clearly indicates the duty of submitting it to the test of the soundest principles of philosophy and religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is this: <hi rend="italics">the ascendency which certain popular errors on the subject of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery have acquired, and the extent to which they peril the peace of the country, if not the very liberties of the whole republic</hi>. I allude to the fact that there are many in the country &mdash; and not a few of this number spread <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>through our Southern States--who would not intentionally arraign the piety of their fellow-citizens, but whose minds (it is painfully humiliating to know) are in a state of great embarrassment on this subject; so much so, that they are constantly liable to be made the victims of any fanatical influences abroad in the land, no less than the dupes of that large class of political aspirants who, reckless of both truth and morals, would secure their elevation at any price.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Nor need we wonder at the ascendency of erroneous opinions on the subject of slavery, any mor&lt;*&gt;than at the results which they threaten.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>At an early period in our history, <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n0062.0001.00015.00008" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> denounced domestic slavery as sinful, <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>, and declared that <quote>there was no attribute in the <name>Divine</name> mind which could take sides with the whites in a controversy between the races:</quote> thus assuming in this remark, that the providences as well as the attributes of the <name>Deity</name> are against the slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Owing to the prominence given by our <placeName reg="Puritan, Vinton, Ohio" key="tgn,2601475">Puritan</placeName> fathers to the higher institutions of learning, together with the fact that the soil and the climate of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> were unfavorable to agricultural pursuits, citizens of these States have, from an early period in the history of the republic, supplied the most of the text-books for the schools and colleges of the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>This <pb id="p.16" n="16"/>grossly offensive error of <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00016.00009" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> has been more or less diffused through the whole of these text-books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It has been among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of speculations upon abstract truth presented to the minds of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It has been studiously inculcated from professors' chairs in colleges and universities in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, while Southern literary institutions have been for the most part silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The pulpits of the <rs>South</rs> have also lent their aid, and in some instances have been zealous and active in propagating this error.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>As early as <dateStruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></dateStruct>, the <name>Methodists</name> declared, in a <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">general convention</orgName> of preachers, that <quote>slavery is contrary to the laws of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, man, and nature, and hurtful to society; contrary to the dictates of conscience and pure religion; doing that which we would not that others should do to us and ours; and that we pass our disapprobation upon all our friends who keep slaves, and advise their freedom.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>This doctrine was reasserted after the organization of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> in <dateStruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></dateStruct>, and, with short intervals of time, and unimportant variations of phraseology, the essential features of this doctrine have been adhered to until the present time, by this most numerous body of professing Christians in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>At an early day, <persName n="Coke,Bishop,,,," id="n0062.0001.00016.00010" reg="mostcommon:Coke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Coke</surname></persName>, of the <rs>M. E. Church</rs>, openly advocated this doctrine in the pulpits of the country, until <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>silenced by the force of public opinion; yet he did not cease, while he remained in the country, to exert the full amount of his personal influence in private and social circles against the institution of domestic slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>His example was followed by a large number of his preachers, and many ministers of other <name>Christian</name> denominations, who imbibed the same doctrine and were animated by the same spirit of hostility to the institution; and who, like himself, were only held in abeyance by the same force of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Many politicians, also, there were, from time to time, who did not scruple to avow <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00017.00011" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>'s doctrine, and like him affect to foresee dreadful calamities overhanging the country as a consequence of domestic slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>In view of these facts, it cannot be a matter of surprise that abolition opinions and sentiments should pervade the non-slaveholding sections of the country; and that at least a private but painful impression or suspicion that there must be something wrong in the principle of domestic slavery, should be found to pervade a portion even of the <rs>Southern</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Reluctant as we may be to admit the truth, necessity compels us to do so. Let the following facts bear witness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>No communities on earth are so free from domestic insurrections, and the disturbing influences which come up from the lower orders of society, <pb id="p.18" n="18"/>as those of the <rs>Southern States</rs> of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The social condition of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName>, and the states of the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, are per. petually subject to the disturbing and ruinous influence of local, and often widely spread, insurrectionary movements against the social order, and even the safety of the governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Nor are the <rs>Northern States</rs> of this Union any more free from these agrarian movements, than may be accounted for by the relative sparseness of their population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Yet a general feeling of security pervades all these people, whilst it is notorious that there are a great many in Southern communities who are in a constant state of feverish excitement on the subject of domestic insurrections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Any announcement of that kind is sufficient to convulse a whole community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The trifling affair of <persName n="Turner,,Nathaniel,,," id="n0062.0001.00018.00012" reg="default:Turner,Nathaniel,,,"><foreName n="Nathaniel">Nat.</foreName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName> (trifling compared with the frequent disturbances and loss of life common in the communities just referred to) painfully agitated the whole <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>; and occupied her Legislature through a whole winter in grave discussions as to the <quote>best means of freeing the <rs>State</rs> from the incubus of slavery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>These results have all followed from the causes at which we have glanced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>In this state of things, it is in vain to appeal to the fact that <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00018.00013" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, though a profound <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>statesman, and to some extent a logician, was neither a divine nor a metaphysician; and that no people on the globe have shared more largely in the blessings of a bountiful <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> than those of the <rs>Southern States</rs> of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In the progress of civilization and religion, they have advanced more rapidly than any communities in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Still, <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00019.00014" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>'s name does not lose its enchantment; and having already learned to despise the unexampled blessings of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, many of the <rs>Southern</rs> people actually believed &mdash; until railroad communications began to dispel the illusion &mdash; that their own happy States were really falling back in civilization to the darkness of the middle ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Add to all this, the halls of legislation continue to echo the opinion that <quote>domestic slavery is a great moral, political, and social evil.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>In this connection, the phrase, moral evil, is restricted to its appropriate meaning, <hi rend="italics">sin</hi>. No doubt, <persName n="Doddridge,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00019.00015" reg="mostcommon:Doddridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Doddridge</surname></persName>, <persName n="Rives,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00019.00016" reg="mostcommon:Rives,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Rives</surname></persName>, <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00019.00017" reg="mostcommon:Clay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Clay</surname></persName>, <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00019.00018" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, and many others &mdash; illustrious names!--who have substantially used this language in various connections, only meant to deprecate the evils of slavery in strong terms, that they might propitiate a more favorable consideration of what they had to say in its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>But if we be correct in the position already postulated, it is quite time our politicians, no less than our ecclesiastics, had <pb id="p.20" n="20"/>learned to chasten their language on this subject, The fountains of public thought and feeling have, to a great extent, been poisoned: that is, the abstract opinions and religious sentiments of the people have been corrupted and perverted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The <num value="3">three</num> great Protestant denominations<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> 
<p>The Methodists and Baptists, it is well known, divided directly upon the subject of slavery; and the <name>Presbyterians</name> mediately upon a question of constitutional law; but there is reason to believe that the slavery agitation in the <orgName n="Presbyterian Church" type="church">Presbyterian Church</orgName> precipitated a division, which otherwise would probably have been averted.</p></note> of the country have been torn asunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The flags of their time-honored unions are trailing in the dust; and they have ceased to operate as bonds to our political union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>A secret suspicion of the morality of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery in the <rs>South</rs>, occupies the minds of many of our best citizens &mdash; citizens who are at a vast remove from the fanaticism which stigmatizes those who are known as the ultra abolitionists of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The great family of Methodists in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, the slave States of <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and a part of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, retain their connection with the abolition division of the <rs>M.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>All along the line of division between the <rs>M. E. Church</rs>, North, and the <rs>M. E.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The experiment of abolition fanaticism is progressing; and the souls as well as the bodies of men are in the crucible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It is clear that <quote>whilst we have slept, an enemy hath sown these tares,</quote> in our literature, our politics, and our theology.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><num value="2">Two</num> striking phenomena remain to be noticed and accounted for. Amid all the conflict of opinion and feeling upon this subject,--which was inseparable from doctrines so utterly at war with the practices of the country &mdash; a conflict which at an. early period found its way into the halls of legislation, civil and ecclesiastical, and has not ceased to the present time to modify the federal politics of the country,--the <name>African</name> population has yielded only to certain physical and moral laws as to the place of its location; whilst the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, which embodies the great mass of that population in the country, has held on the even tenor of its way, unchecked in the slightest degree by the antagonistic doctrines and sentiment which have warred so fiercely against it, and which at so many periods have threatened the country with a legion of disastrous consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>In the first place, the <name>African</name> population has gradually receded to those sections of the <rs>Union</rs> which, from their climate and soil, were better <pb id="p.22" n="22"/>adapted to slave labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Why did not the abstract opinions and sentiments set forth by <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00022.00019" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> and the <rs>M. E. Church</rs>, and which are supposed to have given birth to the emancipation laws of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, operate to retain within those States the large portion of slave population then held, and secure their practical freedom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Why did they escape the supposed charity of these doctrines, and find their way, not as freemen, but as slaves, to a climate and soil more congenial to their nature and destiny?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Are these doctrines real abstract truths, as their advocates profess to believe them to be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Then they are fundamental &mdash; they are vital &mdash; they are life-giving, and can never fail to impress their own essential character upon every system to which they are applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The citizens of the <rs>Northern States</rs> adopted these doctrines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Then it was an affair of conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Emancipation laws were said to be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>But that these laws, supposed to be founded in the belief of certain great abstract truths, which secured to the <name>African</name> his civil freedom, should operate only to transfer him to a climate and soil better suited to his condition as a slave, is a phenomenon for which the hypothesis does not ac,count.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>And again, the institution itself, of domestic slavery, by reason of causes which are evidently, though mysteriously, at work, is this <pb id="p.23" n="23"/>day more firmly grounded in the confidence of the great mass of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and more extensively ramified and interlocked with other civil institutions of the whole country, than at any former period of its history!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>How is this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The abstract opinions and sentiments in question, pervading our literature, our politics, and our theology, have been adopted by so many of our citizens as to entitle the doctrine to be regarded as a kind of national belief &mdash; the sentiment a kind of national feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>We are told that all men <hi rend="italics">believe</hi> slavery to be wrong in principle; that is, wrong in itself!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>and that all men feel that it is wrong!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>And certain it is, there is more truth than fiction in all this!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>It is strictly true, as to the citizens of the so-called free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The same doctrine is not without advocates at the <rs>South</rs>; whilst many more, as we have before stated, who may not be said to believe it, are nevertheless often the subjects of painful misgivings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>They <hi rend="italics">fear</hi> it may be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The causes to which we have traced this, fully account for it; and we need not fear to state the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>But then again, the question recurs &mdash; How is this, that the institution itself, a great practical truth, should daily, for a long series of years, become more and more practical &mdash; a fixed fact in the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Truly, this is a phenomenon for which the philosophy of the day will not <pb id="p.24" n="24"/>account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>If those who believed this doctrine were ruthless fanatics &mdash; ultra abolitionists in the strictest sense &mdash; if those who oppose it were really <quote>pro-slavery</quote> men, in the bad sense in which certain persons understand this phrase, that is, men who, on the subject of slavery, wickedly do what they know and feel to be wrong: on either hypothesis we could account for the phenomenon in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>But these are not the men with whom I deal in these lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>I lay all such out of the account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>They are men not to be reasoned with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>No: the men of whom I speak, both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, are candid, honest men. I personally know many of them at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>I have met them on great battle-fields, where more than blood was shed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>I know them to be good men and true, and I believe the same of the large class they represent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>With many of those at the <rs>South</rs> who affiliate with them in opinion as firm believers in <placeName reg="Jefferson, Ashtabula, Ohio" key="tgn,2080123">Jefferson</placeName>'s doctrine, or whose embryo opinions excite painful misgivings of mind, I have often communed freely, and have equal confidence in their integrity and honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The whole taken together form a very numerous class, and may be safely regarded as embodying the national belief and feeling on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>And yet we find that slavery is a great practical truth, a fixed fact in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Now, can it be true <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>that this opinion and feeling embodies a great abstract truth &mdash; a fundamental, vital, immutable principle, which never did and never can fail to hold practical error in check, because it takes hold of the conscience of an honest people &mdash; and whose tendency, therefore, is always to an ultimate practical triumph, with all those who honestly receive it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>We dare not affirm this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It is not mere belief, nor is it mere honesty, that produces results in practice; but it is the <hi rend="italics">reception of the truth in an honest heart</hi>, which can never fail to result in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Now in this case the people are honest, and the people believe; and if it be essential truth which they thus believe, then, we say, the fact that in all those States of this republic in which climate and soil are adapted to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> labor &mdash; that precisely there the institution of domestic slavery should be rooted in the practice of a large portion of this believing and honest people, and that it should strike its roots into the federal constitution, and penetrate deeper and deeper every year into the legislation of the whole country, and thus implicate more and more the whole mass of this believing people in the sin of it, is a phenomenon, for which the postulate, that it is the truth they believe, does not account &mdash; nor can it be made to account.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>A false principle may be believed to be the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/><pb id="p.26" n="26"/>And a false principle believed, has its results, be cause it is believed; and they very much resemble the results of truth believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>But we dare not admit that error can take hold of the conscience as pure principle, essential truth will do it. But, again, there is another great psychological fact, which is often overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>A false principle may be honestly believed by minds which, at the same time, adopt antagonistic principles that are essential truths; but, owing to various causes calculated to confuse the ideas, the inconsistency is not perceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Now, in such a case as this, the principle of essential truth is really brought into practical antagonism with essential error, and that in the same minds and upon the same subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>And as truth is more powerful than error in the minds of all honest people, the truth holds its way in practical results, in defiance of false principle, which is relatively powerless in the presence of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The antagonism between the false principle and the practical results of things may be perceived and acknowledged; whilst the antagonism of the false principle with the true principle, which underlies and produces these practical results by a law of its own operation, is not only not perceived, but actually denied to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Now so long as this false principle is honestly believed to be true, and clearly perceived to be in conflict with the <hi rend="italics">practice</hi>, <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>but not perceived to be in conflict with other and more latent principles, which are in themselves <hi rend="italics">truths</hi>, and admitted to be <hi rend="italics">truths</hi>, and which produce this <hi rend="italics">practice</hi>, just so long will this false principle wage war, by the simple law of belief, against this <hi rend="italics">practice</hi>. But as this war is not sufficiently potent to overturn this practice, because it is founded on the belief of principles <hi rend="italics">true</hi> in themselves, the practice will remain; and so long as this false belief remains, the strife with the practice must remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Hence, if this be the state of the public mind in this country on the subject of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery, and it find no efficient remedy, we can see nothing awaiting us but interminable strife &mdash; men against themselves &mdash; the country against the country!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>We forbear to sketch the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>But, young gentlemen, I submit if this psychology may not furnish a solution of the phenomena I have brought to your notice, and also a remedy against that otherwise interminable strife which has already done so much to impair the moral power and blight the fairest hopes of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>May it not be that in admitting the great abstract doctrine of <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00027.00020" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, that the principle of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery is, <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>, sinful, and that, as such, the attributes and providence of Deity are opposed to all who practice it, we have most <pb id="p.28" n="28"/>unwisely admitted a false doctrine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>And as this false doctrine, though honestly believed by a number sufficiently large to designate it as the national belief and the national feeling, has utterly failed to abolish or even to modify the institution of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery, does it not afford a strong and clear presumption, to say the least, that this system which has held unbroken dominion over the <name>African</name> race in this country for over <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure>, and which continues to strike its roots deeper and deeper into all the relations of society, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>--that this system, so potent in practical results, and so heedless of the fierce war that is waged against it, is, after all, <hi rend="italics">underlaid</hi> somewhere by a <hi rend="italics">vast mine of principles &mdash; pure essential truths</hi>--which are firmly rooted in the belief of all civilized and honest men, and which, all along, have imparted a spontaneous being and activity to the system, and will continue to do so perhaps as long as any considerable portion of the race shall remain in the country?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>If this hypothesis shall prove true, the sovereign remedy for the otherwise interminable strife, so potent for mischief, is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Let us then free ourselves, let us free the country, of the dominion of <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0001.00028.00021" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>'s philosophy, because it is false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>In doing this, we shall terminate the conflict which now rages with so much violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>We shall be <pb id="p.29" n="29"/>free to address ourselves to any modifications in the system of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery which may be demanded to adapt it to the progress of civilization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Regarding the whole subject in this light, the duty of thoroughly investigating it seems to me to be laid upon the country as a moral necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>It is useless to talk of <quote>delicacy and humiliation,</quote> in the presence of such fruits as a false philosophy has already borne plentifully throughout the land.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>I propose to lead your way in <hi rend="italics">exploring the mine of truth</hi> which we may assume to underlie the system of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>We may look with confidence to reach these results:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/><num value="1">1</num>. That the philosophy of <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0062.0001.00029.00022" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> is false, and that the opposite is true, namely, that the great abstract principle of domestic slavery is, <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>, right; and therefore it is not in the use but in the abuse of this principle that we are liable to sin, and thereby incur the <name>Divine</name> displeasure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Our schools must be supplied with correct text-books on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The <rs type="place">Church</rs> should not <pb id="p.30" n="30"/>only right herself as she has done in the <rs>South</rs>, but her voice should be heard in the pulpit enforcing <hi rend="italics">right principles</hi>, as well as right duties, upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Her voice should certainly be heard under circumstances so urgent as the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>It is due to many in Southern communities whose minds are, more or less, disturbed by the long-continued abuse of the pulpit, and the social influence of mistaken ministers of religion in private life.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>I now propose to enter directly upon the inquiry, <hi rend="italics">Is the institution of domestic slavery sinful</hi>? My plan will make it necessary, in this lecture, to limit the inquiry to the <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> of the institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>If the institution be sinful, it must be so either in the abstract principle it involves, or in the specific form under which it embodies that principle, or in both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>In either case, <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0062.0002.00031.00024" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>'s doctrine is verified; for if the <hi rend="italics">abstract principle</hi> be wrong, then the institution which envelops the principle, and from which it derives its character, is of course wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>It certainly is never right to act upon a wrong principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Injustice, <pb id="p.32" n="32"/>as a principle, is confessedly wrong in itself, according to the ideas of all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>No form which an action can take will make it right, if it proceed upon an unjust principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Hence, no circumstances can justify any man in knowingly doing an act of injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>If the institution of domestic slavery envelops the idea of injustice, or any similar element, as its generic or abstract principle, in such case it would certainly be wrong both in principle and in practice; that is, wrong in itself; and we should, without scruple, abandon the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>But a similar conclusion will not follow from a contrary proposition; that is, it will not follow, that if the abstract principle of the institution be right, the institution itself is right; because the truth of a conditional proposition does not turn on the hypothesis, but on the <hi rend="italics">consequent</hi>, as both true in itself and dependent upon the antecedent condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>That this is not the case in this instance is developed by the fact that the <hi rend="italics">affirmative</hi> proposition involved in this conditional is, in itself, an absurdity, viz., <quote>An <hi rend="italics">abstract principle</hi> of action being right, the <hi rend="italics">action itself</hi> is right.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>This is absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>For instance, justice, in itself, is a <hi rend="italics">right principle</hi> of action, according to the ideas of all mankind; but it does not follow that all actions which proceed upon the principle of <hi rend="italics">justice</hi> are <hi rend="italics">right</hi> actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>A. justly <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>owes B. <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure>: now, to enforce the payment of this money would be in itself a just act, because the money is honestly owed by A.; but if, in doing this, B. should take the last bed from under the wife and children of A., and deprive them of the last morsel of bread, the <hi rend="italics">act itself</hi> would be a very wicked <num value="1">one</num>, and he would be judged by mankind as but little less guilty than a highway robber, because this is a case in which the claims of <hi rend="italics">benevolence</hi> march before the claims of mere <hi rend="italics">justice</hi>. Not to respect the claims of benevolence in such a case is to act upon the <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> of pure <hi rend="italics">selfishness</hi>. This act, then, would envelop also a wrong principle &mdash; selfishness; and it is the nature of a wrong principle to spread the hue and poison of guilt over every act into which it enters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Truth, and its opposite, as principles, are striking examples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>If we speak at all, we should speak the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Every utterance into which, in its proper, generic sense, the <hi rend="italics">lie</hi> enters, even in the least degree, is a poisoned act; and he who does this, is to that extent a basely wicked man, however smooth his tongue or winning his manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Guilt has poisoned his utterance; and if this vice be not speedily arrested in its progress, it will spread itself through the whole mass, and break down his entire moral constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>But it does not certainly follow that all utterances which <pb id="p.34" n="34"/>are in themselves <hi rend="italics">truths</hi>, are right utterances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>There are many facts, to which, if we were to give utterance, we should only speak the truth, but at the same time we all know that they should lie buried (perhaps for ever) in the depths of our own hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>To injure our neighbor by speaking the truth when no claim of paramount justice demanded it, and the claims of charity or kindness forbade it, would be a wicked act. For a child in a similar way to injure a parent would be the conduct of a demon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>All such acts, though they envelop a right principle &mdash; truth &mdash; do at the same time envelop a wrong <hi rend="italics">principle &mdash; malevolence;</hi> and it is the nature of wrong principle to stamp every act into which it enters with the character of guilt--<hi rend="italics">it is wrong</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The conclusion we reach is this: If the abstract or generic principle of an action be <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, the action itself is therefore <hi rend="italics">wrong;</hi> but that, if the abstract principle be <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, it does not follow that the action is therefore <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, but that the action itself is <hi rend="italics">either right or wrong</hi>, as may be determined by the presence or absence of certain other coincident principles; or, as we usually say, as may be determined by the circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>If, then, the abstract principle of the institution of domestic slavery be wrong, the institution itself is wrong, and ought to be abolished; but if <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>the principle be correct, the institution itself is or is not <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, just as the circumstances of the case may or may not require that it be maintained; as in the case of any other act involving correct principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The points to be settled, then, are--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I. Is the abstract or generic principle of dometic slavery <hi rend="italics">right or wrong</hi>? And if it be right, then,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/><num value="2">II</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Is the system (so far as it is a system, simply) of domestic slavery, enveloping this abstract principle, justified by the circumstances of the case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>If so, the system itself is also <hi rend="italics">right</hi>. Whether many slaveholders or few, or any at all, are themselves doing right in the exercise of the legal functions of that relation, are questions foreign from the present inquiries, even on the hypothesis that the system itself is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Their conduct, be it right or wrong, (and in many cases it is right, and in many others it is no doubt wrong,) does not at all affect the truth or error of the questions now before us. It is not with the conduct of individual men that we now deal; but with the act of that great being, the <rs>State</rs>--the system of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery established by law in the country &mdash; and with that profound principle of truth or error which not only makes it a <hi rend="italics">system</hi>, but makes it a right system or a wrong system, as the case may be. <pb id="p.36" n="36"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The philosophy which prevails on the question before us has originated <num value="2">two</num> schools &mdash; the <hi rend="italics">abolitionist</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">anti-slavery</hi>. The abolitionist maintain that the <hi rend="italics">abstract principle of the system is wrong</hi>, and that therefore the system itself is wrong under all circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The anti-slavery school agree with the abolitionist that the <hi rend="italics">principle is wrong</hi>, but divide among themselves as to the conclusion they draw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Some hold that the institution itself is not wrong under all circumstances, and that therefore slaves may be held under it in given cases without guilt; and others, that the institution <hi rend="italics">is wrong in itself</hi>, and should be abolished by the <rs>State</rs>, but that the holding of slaves under this <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi> system is not an act in itself <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi> in all cases.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>A strict analysis of the subject will show that here is a strange medley of principles and conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>I shall be found to agree with each, and to disagree with each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>I <hi rend="italics">disagree</hi> with both on the abstract principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Hence, I disagree with the abolitionists on the whole proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>But I agree with the abolitionists that if the abstract principle be <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, the institution is wrong in all cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>I say with them that all who grant the antecedent of this conditional are bound to admit the consequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Hence I disagree with the antislavery school in admitting that the principle is <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>wrong; but in so far as they admit that the system may be right under given circumstances, or that slaves may be held under it without guilt, we agree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>I stand, therefore, committed to the affirmative of the question, both in regard to the principle and to the institution, and hence proceed to discuss the question:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>I. Is the abstract principle of domestic slavery right or wrong?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>I have already noticed that the public mind has been so long abused on this subject, that it is usual for highly intelligent persons, who have no idea of affirming that the slaveholder is necessarily a sinner, to allow that slaveholding is <hi rend="italics">wrong in principle</hi>. But this, to say the least, is a strange abuse of terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The right or wrong of an action, in itself considered, is determined by the <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> which it envelops, and the moral character of the <hi rend="italics">actor</hi> is determined by his intention in the performance, or by his voluntary or involuntary ignorance of the principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It is reasonable, therefore, to infer that the public attach no well-defined meaning to the phrase, the <hi rend="italics">abstract principle of slavery</hi>. Its definite meaning, however, is indispensable in this investigation; and, indeed, on all occasions, if we would speak correctly, and avoid misapplication of this term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/><pb id="p.38" n="38"/></p> 
<p>What, then, is the <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> of the system of domestic slavery?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Observe that it is the principle for which we inquire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>What, then, is the system itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>For (to speak with strict philosophical propriety) our idea of the system is the chronological condition of our idea of the principle, as our idea of the principle is the logical condition of our idea of the system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>We must perceive an action before we can determine what is the principle of it, although we must have an antecedent knowledge of the principle before we can determine what character that principle gives to the action,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The system is made up of <num value="2">two</num> correlative relations &mdash; master and slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Here there are but <num value="2">two</num> ideas &mdash; the idea of master and the idea of slave, as correlatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>These are all the ideas that enter into the system, as a system merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Whatever abstract principle, therefore, this system envelops, is to be found in these <num value="2">two</num> terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It need not and should not be sought for anywhere else; for these <num value="2">two</num> relations make the whole system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Without these it could not be a system of slavery; and with these, it is therein, and in virtue of that fact alone, a system of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The answer to the question depends upon the meaning of these terms alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>What, then, is the correlative meaning of these terms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>And whether they are considered as abstract or concrete terms, they are correlatives &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> implies the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>A <hi rend="italics">system</hi> of slavery is a state or order of things established by law or custom, in which <num value="1">one</num> set of men are the masters to a given extent, and another are the slaves to that extent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/><hi rend="italics">Domestic</hi> slavery is an instance in which the order or state of things constituting the system itself, is made a part of the family relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Domestic slavery, therefore, is <num value="1">one</num> of the forms of the <hi rend="italics">general</hi> system of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The system has existed under various forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The ancient system of villanage in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, of serfdom in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, the peon system of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, as well as domestic slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, are all examples of slavery proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>This leads us to remark that the terms <hi rend="italics">master</hi> and <hi rend="italics">slave</hi> are not only abstract but <hi rend="italics">general abstract</hi> terms: <hi rend="italics">general</hi>, because the abstract ideas they convey are common to each of these conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Each of these systems is pervaded by generic principles or ideas, which classify the whole as belonging to the same genus &mdash; system of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The abstract principle of slavery is therefore the general idea, which is enveloped alike in each and every form or system of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Hence, as the abstract idea of master is governing by <num value="1">one</num>'s own will, and that of slave is submission or subjection to such control; and as a system of slavery is a condition into which these ideas enter in correlation &mdash; it follows that <hi rend="italics">the abstract principle of slavery is the <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs> of submission or subjection to control by the will of another</hi>. This is the fundamental idea which is common to every form of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>No condition into which this does not enter as a fundamental idea is a state of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Every condition <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>into which it enters is a state of slavery to the extent in which it does so enter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/><hi rend="italics">Submission or subjection to control by the will of another</hi> being our definition of the abstract principle of the system of slavery, <num value="2">two</num> questions arise: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>--Is this a correct definition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>--If it be correct, is it a sound, legitimate principle, which may and ought to be adopted in practice, whenever it may be wise to do so?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num></hi>--Is the definition correct?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/><hi rend="italics">Subjection</hi> is the being put under the control of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/><hi rend="italics">Submission</hi> is the delivery of <num value="1">one</num>'s self to the control of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The <num value="1">one</num> implies the consent of the rill, and the other does not. That subjection is an idea which fulfils the condition of slavery will not be disputed by any. Hence our definition is sufficiently wide to embrace that which is conceded by all. But our definition gives much greater breadth to the principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>It takes in <hi rend="italics">submission</hi> as well as <hi rend="italics">subjection</hi>. It assumes that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>the willing or the nilling of the subject of this form of control does not necessarily enter into the principle which logically defines it. lie who is subjected to such control is a slave; and he who submits to such control is not the less so. This principle might therefore be still further generalized--<hi rend="italics">control by the will of another</hi>, with its correlative idea submission or subjection only implied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/><pb id="p.42" n="42"/>But we prefer to define it in the terms employed, as being more likely to be appreciated in the sense intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Are we correct in giving this wide compass of meaning to the principle in question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Do we assume too much when we say that a man is not the less a captive, and subject to the control of the captor, because he voluntarily gives himself up as such?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Is a man then the less a slave who voluntarily consents to be controlled by the will of another?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The popular use of terms in all languages shows that mankind have conceded this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>They all apply the idea of slave to such a case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Nay, more, they furnish a constructive meaning of the term based upon this meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The commands of their masters might be obeyed from mere prudential considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>In this case, their obedience would be without the religious element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Many, no doubt, obeyed: gave the <hi rend="italics">consent</hi> of their wills, as they gave the assent of their <pb id="p.44" n="44"/>understandings; and hence, cheerfully submitting to their providential condition as from the <rs>Lord</rs>, they obeyed their masters <quote>in singleness of heart as unto <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0062.0002.00044.00034" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They submitted, as any other good man submits, with consent as well as assent to his providential condition, and goes forth to the duties of that condition with a cheerful heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Their condition was therefore changed from that of <hi rend="italics">subjection</hi> to <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend="italics">submission</hi>, and for as long a time as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> might be pleased to continue it. Did they, by reason of such submission, cease to be slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Certainly not. They were slaves when in a state of <hi rend="italics">subjection</hi>. They were not the less so when, from the high <name>Christian</name> motives commanded by the apostle, their condition was changed to <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend="italics">submission</hi>. Be this, however, as it may, the following case is decisive of the whole question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The ancient Jew, who <hi rend="italics">gave</hi> himself into slavery, was not the less a slave because he did it voluntarily; and the <name>Mosaic</name> law provided that such should be held and treated as slaves in perpetuity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>See Exodus <num value="21">XXI</num>. <num value="5">5</num>, <num value="6">6</num> : <quote>And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children: <hi rend="italics">I will not go out free;</hi> then his master shall bring him unto the judges: he shall also bring him unto the door, or to the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; <hi rend="italics">and he shall serve him for</hi> <pb id="p.45" n="45"/><hi rend="italics">ever</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Thus the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made a man a slave who became so by his own voluntary act. A state of <hi rend="italics">submission</hi>, therefore, to <hi rend="italics">control by the will of another</hi>, is no less a state of slavery than a state of <hi rend="italics">subjection</hi>. If the state itself be <num value="1">one</num> of slavery, the idea, <hi rend="italics">submission</hi>, which makes it so, is in this case an element of the system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Hence, the true philosophical definition of the principle, as before stated, is <hi rend="italics">control by the will of another</hi>, with its correlative (subjection, or submission, as the case might be) implied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It may be the <num value="1">one</num>; it may be the other; and whichever it is in a given case, is the mere logical accident of <hi rend="italics">that</hi> case, and does not at all affect the <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>As the whole of the abstract idea of the system of slavery is to be found in the terms <hi rend="italics">master</hi> and <hi rend="italics">slave</hi> in correlation; and <hi rend="italics">submission and subjection to control by the will of another</hi> is the whole idea contained in the correlative sense of these terms, (certainly nothing more and nothing less,) the definition given is the whole, and nothing more, of the abstract principle of the institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Whoever is in this condition is to that extent a slave. *Whatever system envelops this principle &mdash; it matters not what form it may take, what coincident principles it may include, or what name may be given to it, or how far the practical working of this principle may be modified &mdash; it is nevertheless <pb id="p.46" n="46"/>to the extent that this principle enters into it <hi rend="italics">a system of slavery</hi>. It may be a wise system, because it is a necessary means for the accomplishment of some desirable end; or it may be an unwise system, because it is a means unsuited to the end proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But neither hypothesis will at all affect the principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>That is the same in the <num value="1">one</num> case as in the other; that is, whether it be abused or properly used, the principle itself is the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>But can it be properly used at all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>This leads to the <hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num></hi> inquiry &mdash; Is this a sound, legitimate principle, which may and should be adopted in practice whenever it may be wise to do so?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>We need not scruple to admit that if injustice or any similar idea should be found to enter as an element into the abstract principle, it is a poisoned principle, upon which no honest man will allow himself to act. But is this the case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Doubtless, there may be injustice in slavery, as in every system which has persons for its subjects: that is, any <hi rend="italics">master</hi> acting under the authority of this system may perpetrate great injustice; but we maintain that when he does so he introduces a principle foreign to the system, and for which he is individually responsible: he does that which mars the character of the whole performance, and stamps his own personal conduct with the guilt of injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/><pb id="p.47" n="47"/></p> 
<p>However carelessly many persons are accustomed to speak on this subject, yet we may assure ourselves that a little reflection will satisfy any candid mind that the principle is a legitimate <num value="1">one</num>, and cannot with any degree of propriety be regarded as sinful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It will readily occur to all intelligent minds, that this principle enters more or less as an essential element into every form of human government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>No government can be appropriate to human beings, in their present fallen condition, that does not embody this generic element in a greater or less degree.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>A form of control, clearly embodying the idea of government, and at the same time conferring absolute freedom, is a solecism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>If men would uniformly govern themselves aright by their own wills, there could be no necessity for government, or room for its exercise, at least in the sense in which we now understand the term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>A government adapted to such a people, I allow, might be without the element of physical control, so indispensable in human governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It would be (compared to human) a modification of government &mdash; if government it might be called &mdash; for which our language supplies no term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We cannot conceive it to be appropriate to any intelligences this side of the <quote>spirits of just men made perfect in heaven.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>These, we conceive, are sufficiently <pb id="p.48" n="48"/>intelligent to understand clearly and correctly all the duties appertaining to the various relations they sustain, and so perfected in moral feeling as to fulfil these duties from the impulses of their own <hi rend="italics">spontaneous volitions</hi>. Government, as it may be understood and applied to such intelligences, must be essentially different from that which is appropriate to beings of arbitrary volition; and who, therefore, should be held to accountability in the exercise of their freedom by the most rigid restrictions from penal sanctions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>To these latter a government that did not embody the <hi rend="italics">principle of</hi> slavery would be no government at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Authoritative control, with its correlative, (according to the more general classification given,) is the abstract principle of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>But a state of freedom is the opposite of a state of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The abstract principle of a state of freedom or Liberty is, therefore, the opposite to that of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Hence <hi rend="italics">self-control</hi> is the abstract principle of freedom, as its opposite--<hi rend="italics">control by another</hi>--is the principle of slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Now every government adapted to fallen beings whose personal or mental liberty consists in <hi rend="italics">arbitrary</hi> volition, is necessarily a combination of these <num value="2">two</num> opposite elements &mdash; the principle of freedom and the principle of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Either of these entering alone into the system of government, <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>would in the end defeat the legitimate object of government &mdash; the happiness of the people, If the government were based upon the principle of freedom alone, allowing every man the unrestricted liberty of self-control, the wildest anarchy would result: if to avoid this the opposite principle should be adopted, allowing no liberty of self-control, but subjecting all to control by the will of another, it would be found as impracticable as the other was disastrous, and, as far as successful, only appropriate to idiots and infants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>A good government is such a harmonious union of these opposing elements, as adapts it to the wants of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>For as, in chemistry, elements in opposite states of electricity unite and form valuable compounds, so in political science, antagonistic principles enter necessarily into the composition of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Tie character or kind of the government is defined by the ratios in which these elements enter into its formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>If the principle of slavery enter very largely into the government, in a highly consolidated form, it is then an absolute monarchy or military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>If the exercise of this supreme power is distributed among the heads of families, it assumes the patriarchal or domestic form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>If this principle enter in a less degree, but still in a much greater degree than the principle of self-control, some <num value="1">one</num> of the <pb id="p.50" n="50"/>forms of constitutional monarchy or hereditary aristocracy will result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>If these opposite principles enter into the government in somewhat equal ratios, it is then a democratic republic &mdash; a well-balanced government &mdash; such as ours is designed to be. Hence we see that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has rendered the blessing of civil freedom inseparable from the presence and operation of the principle of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Such is the present arrangement, that government can no otherwise secure freedom to its subjects than by abridging them to a certain extent of self-control; or, in other words, government must place its subjects under the operation of the principle of slavery in some things, the more effectually to secure their practical freedom in other things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>And the citizen who may be determined not to submit to this order of things, and shall persist to do, from the action of, a depraved will, what the <rs>State</rs>--<hi rend="italics">his master</hi>--says he shall not do, will, sooner or later, find himself reduced to a condition of most abject slavery, within the walls of a public prison.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It is entirely obvious that a government, to secure the highest amount of happiness to its subjects, must be adapted to their social and moral condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>This adaptation, as before intimated, can only be effected by the ratios in which the antagonistic elements of <hi rend="italics">liberty and of slavery</hi> shall <pb id="p.51" n="51"/>enter into the composition of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Now this is virtually the position, after all, of a no less distinguished abolitionist and literary man than <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0002.00051.00035" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>, the author of your text.

Now this is said, by <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0002.00052.00037" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>, after waging a relentless war against both the principle and practice of slavery!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Is not this an instance in which a great and honest mind, having adopted certain false notions in an-tagonism with the system of slavery, wars against this system; whilst, at the same time, this system is underlaid, even in his own method of reasoning, by a vast mine of fundamental principles which, in spite of him, give it both being and activity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Why need <num value="1">one</num> so learned as <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0002.00052.00038" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> allow the truth to escape his notice, because in <num value="1">one</num> connection it wears the livery of <num value="1">one</num> form of words, and in another connection very properly assumes the livery of a different form of language?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>To proceed: History informs us of many such communities as those defined by <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0002.00052.00039" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>, to which any other form of government would be entirely inappropriate but the <num value="1">one</num> he calls a <hi rend="italics">government of force or a military despotism</hi>, <quote>which is none other than the very highest form of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>And your own good sense, young gentlemen, must assure you that it would be grossly absurd to confer on reckless boys of <num value="15">fifteen</num>, or a mass of stupid pagans, all the rights of free citizens of this great republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>No: the <num value="1">one</num> class should be retained under the slavery (for let <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>us not scruple to call things by their right names) of <hi rend="italics">authoritative control</hi> by their parents; and the other should be subjected to the operation of the same <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs> by the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>And to adopt <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0002.00053.00040" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>'s own language on this point &mdash; suicidal as it is to him &mdash; we add, in regard to such citizens as are</quote> <hi rend="italics">entirely surrendered to the influence of passion</hi>, <quote>that after a government of force has been established, and habits of subordination have been formed, while the moral restraints are yet too feeble for self-government, an hereditary government, which addresses itself to the imagination, and strengthens itself by the influence of domestic connections and established usage, may be as good a form of government as they can sustain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>As they advance in intellectual and moral cultivation, it may advantageously become more and more elective; and in a suitable moral condition, it may be wholly so.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Now, to vary the language in which these important facts are expressed, so as to bring out the great philosophical principles which so evidently underlie them, we would say, that when the government adapted to an ignorant and depraved people has operated under wise appliances to form habits of subordination among the masses, a modification of the elements of government is indicated as best suited to their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> of the forms of <pb id="p.54" n="54"/>hereditary government may be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>In this government, the <hi rend="italics">principle of slavery</hi> is made to operate less actively, and there is. more room for the play of the opposite principle of self-control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>But as the moral principle is yet too feeble for self-government proper, it is still held in strong check by its antagonistic principle &mdash; the principle of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>As they advance in intellectual and moral cultivation, a further modification of the relative operation of these principles is indicated as proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>It may become more and more elective: that is, more and more of a democratic republic; and in a suitable moral condition it may be wholly so: that is, a government in which the <hi rend="italics">principle of slavery</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">principle of liberty</hi> operate in about equal ratios.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We call this a well-balanced government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>If it fulfil this condition, it is because these opposing principles so check and counterpoise each other that the government is not likely to be unbalanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/><num value="1">One</num> holds the other <hi rend="italics">in equilibrio</hi>. The principle of self-control is in such vigorous operation among the masses, and so craned up to a vigilant activity by coincident forces derived from intelligence and interest, that the <hi rend="italics">principle of slavery &mdash; control by the will of another, which in this instance is the will of the majority</hi>--is not competent, according to the theory of this government, to override and crush the <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>liberties of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>On the other hand, the <hi rend="italics">principle of slavery</hi>, which is the great <hi rend="italics">practical force</hi> of the government, enfeebled as it is by a prevailing popular enthusiasm for the widest freedom, and deriving no <hi rend="italics">present</hi> aid from interest, finds this deficiency so fully supplied by the fact that its impersonation is <hi rend="italics">the will of the majority</hi>, that it is competent to resist the most violent shocks which may come up from the misguided self-control of the masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>How often have we seen, in the history of our glorious republic the excited passions of the masses, misdirecting their power of self-control, sweep like a hurricane over the bosom of our political sea, and lash the waters into a storm that threatened to engulf the hopes of the nation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>But so <hi rend="italics">vital</hi> and so <hi rend="italics">active</hi> was that principle which constitutes the true force of the government, that that great ideal, the <rs>State</rs>--the <quote>Ship of state!</quote> --outrode the tempest in. perfect safety; and last, as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the flag of liberty still streamed from the mast-head.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Now, this is as far as the science of free government, so called, has been carried into practical operation; and in this we cannot fail to see that the restraining and controlling <hi rend="italics">principle of slavery</hi> is still in vigorous operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>We call it, by way of eminence, a <hi rend="italics">free</hi> government; and so it is, <hi rend="italics">relatively to other forms, a very free government</hi>. But <pb id="p.56" n="56"/>then it is only relatively, not absolutely, so; for if it were rendered entirely free, by excluding the operation of the principle of slavery altogether, it would be reduced at once to a form of government which authorizes every man to do in all things and in all respects just as he might please to do &mdash; a guaranty which in the present state of fallen human nature it could never make good, and, therefore, virtually it would be no government at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Seeing that the abstract principle of slavery enters necessarily and essentially as an element into every form of civil government, it is worse than idle to affirm that it is wrong, <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>. But more than this, it has the sanction of Jehovah: for government, of which we have seen it is a necessary element, is expressly declared in Holy Scripture to be his ordinance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It entered largely into the theocracy by which he governed the <name>Jewish</name> nation; and indeed is equally prominent in the government which he exercises over all man-kind, if we take it in its wide sense as comprehending the ultimate rewards and punishments that await us in a future state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>How imbecile then is it to say of the system of slavery that it is wrong in the abstract &mdash; wrong in principle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>How little do men consider what they affirm in this declaration!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Certainly no man in his senses <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>will gravely affirm of an essential principle of government that it is wrong!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We repeat, then, it is really time that certain politicians, as well as ecclesiastics, had learned to chasten their language on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>They have already accomplished incalculable mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They have conceded that to the folly of fanaticism which, if it were true, would render domestic slavery, with every other form of civil government, wholly indefensible, and their supporters the objects of the pity and scorn of the civilized world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>There are many among ourselves who, though they are not sufficient metaphysicians to detect and expose the error of a conclusion, are sufficiently candid to admit that if the conceded dogma of <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0062.0002.00057.00041" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> be true, domestic slavery can never be justified in practice by any circumstances whatever; and they have pious feeling enough to prompt them to great hesitation in supporting the institution in view of this admission, although they are pressed to do so by circumstances of urgent duty to the slaves themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>In this state of things there arises in many sensitive minds a most painful state of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Pressed on the <num value="1">one</num> hand by what is assumed to be correct principle, and on the other by the claims of a high moral necessity,--the necessity of governing and providing for their slaves, which they erroneously suppose to <pb id="p.58" n="58"/>be in conflict with right principle,--they really find themselves in a most embarrassing situation, from which they sigh to be released.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Many such have quietly retired from the <rs>State</rs> of their nativity and choice as their only alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>(This may account for more of those removals, usually attributed to worn-out lands, than many of our politicians wot of.) Others remain, it is true, but it is rather an act of subjection than submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Citizens of this class (and it is not a small class) are of course always liable to become the victims of any fanatical movement on the subject of slavery that may be afoot in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>To all this mischief, the speakers and writers in question have contributed their full share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Yea, for myself, I doubt not they have contributed much more to dissatisfy the religious community of the <rs>South</rs>--the large majority of the whole population &mdash; than all the abolitionists of the <rs>North</rs> put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>It is doubtless the magic of their names which at present enables the <rs>M. E. Church</rs> (the most regular and well-defined anti-slavery, if not indeed abolitionist, association this day existing in the country) to maintain its footing in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and along the northern border of Eastern and through a large part of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, together with a portion of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>. <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>It is the authority of their names, also, which so disquiets the feelings of many good people in the whole country as to make them the victims of the political legerdemain of certain politicians, who, under cover of free-soilism <quote>fugitive slave law,</quote> and <quote><placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName></quote> excitements, are overriding their rights and insulting the whole country before the civilized world; and who, last though not least, are daily oppressing the <name>African</name> population by the incubus of a morbid sensibility in regard to them, which utterly prevents the system under which they live from any thing like a reasonable participation in the progress of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>In view of these facts, we again assume that it is really time they had learned to chasten their language on the subject of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Public opinion in the whole country must soon become intolerant of so great an abuse of the truth. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>it is now appropriate to consider some of the speculations in Moral Science which may be supposed to invalidate the position discussed in the preceding lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>As far as they have come under my notice, they all belong to <num value="1">one</num> class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The general objection may be thus stated: <hi rend="italics">Slavery is an abridgment of rights to which the enslaved are entitled by nature; or, more logically, slavery is an abridgment of inalienable rights</hi>. This doctrine is expressed in different forms of language, but is essentially the same in meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It is with the <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>popular view of this subject that I propose to deal in this lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Hence I shall restrict my remarks, in the first place, to the objection as it usually <hi rend="italics">exists in thought</hi>, and notice several popular forms of expression :</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/><num value="1">1</num>. <quote>All men are born free and equal.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Until within a few years past, this dogma was stereotyped in all the text-books of the country &mdash; from the horn-book to the most eminent treatise on Moral Science for colleges and universities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>From the days of <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0062.0003.00061.00044" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> until now, it has been the text for the noisy twaddle of the <quote>stump-politician,</quote> and the profound discussions of the grave senator in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>If this dogma, as it generally exists in thought, be true, it will follow, that any and every abridgment of liberty is a violation of original and natural right &mdash; that is, inalienable right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Hence every system of slavery must be based upon a false principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The popular sense in which this language is generally understood, from father to son, is evidently the literal sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>But taken in this sense, the doctrine is utterly false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>For men are born in a state of infancy, and grow up to the state of manhood; and infants are entirely incapable of freedom, and do not enjoy a particle of it. They <hi rend="italics">are</hi> not, therefore, born equally free, but in a state of entire subjection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>They grow up, it is <pb id="p.62" n="62"/>true &mdash; if they be not imbeciles &mdash; to a degree of mental liberty, that is, the liberty of arbitrary volition in. the plain matters of <hi rend="italics">right</hi> and <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, and hence are accountable; but the degree of this liberty, or how far they are thus mentally free, depends upon the accident of birth, education, and numerous coincident circumstances, which destroys all equality of mental freedom; and as to <hi rend="italics">equality</hi> in other respects, it is scarcely a decent regard to the feelings of mankind to affirm their equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>They are not <hi rend="italics">physically</hi> equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>No <num value="2">two</num> men will compare exactly in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>They are not <hi rend="italics">politically</hi> equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The history of all human governments, throughout all time, shows this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>To be <quote>hewers of wood and drawers of water,</quote> in unequal and subordinate positions, <hi rend="italics">to the few</hi>, has been the lot of the great mass of mankind from the days of <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0062.0003.00062.00045" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>But, says the <quote>socialist,</quote> (to whom the doctrine is far more creditable,) <quote>this latter is precisely the state of things we deprecate, and affirm that such was never the intention of Deity, but that it is his will that there should be no such inequality among men; that his will is in itself <hi rend="italics">the right;</hi> and what it is his will we should be, it is <hi rend="italics">right</hi> for us to be, and it is our right <hi rend="italics">to be;</hi> and that system which makes our condition other than this, deprives us of our rights.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>This is the philosophy of socialism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/><pb id="p.63" n="63"/></p> 
<p>Now it is true that much of the inequality of condition among men is owing to an abuse of the superior power which intelligence confers upon the few; but this admission does not advance the cause of socialism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>For if it were allowed that the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is the only rule of right &mdash; that is, in itself <hi rend="italics">the right</hi>, instead of this, that that which in itself is <hi rend="italics">the right</hi> is the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>--it will not help the argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>For, on this hypothesis, the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is the only rule of right, as on the other it conforms to the only rule of right; so that on either, the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> may be taken as a certain rule of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>What then does he will?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>In regard to the present subject of inquiry, we can only judge what he wills from that which he has done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Now we have seen that he has not endowed the souls of men with equal capacity, nor has he even placed them in circumstances of providential equality, favorable to an equal development of the unequal capacities he has given them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Superior intelligence is the condition of inequality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Where this exists, there is essential inequality, and practical inequality cannot usually be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Hence <hi rend="italics">superior</hi> and <hi rend="italics">inferior</hi>, and cognate terms, are found in all languages, and the conditions they represent are found amongst all people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Hence inequality among men is the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and if his will is the rule of <hi rend="italics">our rights</hi>, we have no abstract <pb id="p.64" n="64"/>right to equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It is rather our duty to submit to that inequality of condition which results from the superior intelligence or moral power of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Superior physical power may, for a time, give us the ascendency; but things will find their level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Superior intelligence will ultimately bear its possessor to his destined eminence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>A state of oppression is not <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend="italics">inequality</hi> merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> in which superior intelligence has degraded and afflicted those who rank below it, in an inferior condition; or it is an instance in which, by the aid of brute force, those of inferior condition have, for a time, risen at the expense of those of superior intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>If we are oppressed, in either of these ways, we have a right to complain, because our oppressors violate the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> concerning us &mdash; violate our rights; but we have no right to complain of <hi rend="italics">inequality</hi> merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Inequality is the law of Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>He who complains of this is not less <hi rend="italics">unwise</hi> than the prisoner who frets at his condition, and chafes himself against the bars and bolts of the prison which securely confines him!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>But if the dogma in question cannot be made to serve the cause of truth, it has often been made to serve the cause of policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Many there are who have not scrupled to use it as a tocsin to call together a clan, not their inferiors merely, but so degraded in their inferiority, that, for the price of <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>being honored with the distinction of <quote><hi rend="italics">free and equal fellow-citizens</hi>,</quote> they have been ready as menials to bow their necks to their masters, debase themselves, dishonor the state, and insult Jehovah!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/><num value="2">2</num>. <quote>All men are created equal.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>This is only another form in which the social philosophy is pleased to express its <num value="1">one</num> idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>We need only notice the additional error acquired by the change of language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/><quote>All men,</quote> it is said, <quote>are created.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>It is written in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of Genesis, that <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> created man in his own image: in the image of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> created he him : male and female created he them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The term <quote>man</quote> is, of course, to be understood in its generic sense, and all that is affirmed is, that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> directly <hi rend="italics">created</hi> <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0062.0003.00065.00046" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName> and Eve, and all their posterity seminally in them; and from whom, therefore, they have proceeded, as to both soul and body, by <hi rend="italics">generation</hi>, and not by a separate act of creation by Jehovah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Now of these <num value="2">two</num> created beings, <num value="1">one</num> was placed in direct and immediate subordination to the other; and although it be true, as it often practically is, that <hi rend="italics">the fall</hi> has reversed this order of things, and placed the wife at the head of affairs, still the doctrine of headship, the doctrine of <hi rend="italics">inequality</hi>, prevails in the <num value="1">one</num> case as in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It is not amiss, however, to remark in passing, that even so great and humble a man as the <rs>Apostle Paul</rs> <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>preferred the old-fashioned doctrine: he insists that we observe the original order of things : <quote>I suffer not a woman to usurp authority over the man ;</quote> <num value="1">1</num> <persName n="Tim,,,,," id="n0062.0003.00066.00047" reg="mostcommon:Tim,nomatch:0"><surname>Tim</surname></persName>. <num value="2">II</num>. <num value="12">12</num>; <quote>but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>As to other points in this dogma, they have been already treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>We only add that philosophy, no less than religion and true patriotism, cannot fail to regret that a dogma setting each of their claims aside, and teaching the purest agrarianism, and that under the most deadly form &mdash; the form of <hi rend="italics">pure abstract truth</hi>--should have found its way into that immortal instrument, the <name>Declaration</name> of American Independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>We cannot otherwise account for it than by the fact that <num value="1">one</num> of the presiding minds of that great paper had become strongly tinctured with the infidel philosophy of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Great and good men, who abhor the folly of socialism, do not scruple to assert that the true theory of all governments is, that they are an abridgment of original and natural rights; forgetful of the fact that it is from the fountain of socialism that they draw their original supply of ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Those of the republican type maintain that the government should be founded upon the <hi rend="italics">concessions</hi> of the majority, and that any thing else is tyranny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>I propose to deal with this idea in a future lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>I now only consider the dogma in the literal sense &mdash; the form in which it exists in popular thought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Literally, what is the state of man by nature?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>and, Is he free and equal in that state?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>We can conceive of man as existing only in <num value="1">one</num> or the other of <num value="2">two</num> states; <num value="1">one</num> of which is his natural state, and the other merely hypothetical: that is, the <hi rend="italics">simple</hi>, or individual state, and the <hi rend="italics">complex</hi>, or social state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>To conceive of men in their simple state, or as <hi rend="italics">not in a state of society</hi>, is to conceive <pb id="p.68" n="68"/>of them as existing as mere individuals : that is, <hi rend="italics">without connection or relation <num value="1">one</num> with the other</hi>. Is this the <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> state of man &mdash; the state intended for him by nature?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Certainly not. It is not known to history, any more than to us, that any set of men ever existed in this way. This, then, is a merely hypothetical state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>In reality, there never was such a state of things, and never will be. Indeed, on the hypothesis that such was the original state of men by nature, or as intended by the <rs>Lord</rs>, it would follow as a mere truism that each <num value="1">one</num> of those separate individuals was <hi rend="italics">free</hi> from control by any <num value="1">one</num> or all of the others: that is, they were all <hi rend="italics">free</hi> and equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>That this truism expresses the truth of the case, no doubt exists in the thought of a great many; but they overlook the hypothesis which makes it a hypothetical truism, merely because it never had any existence in fact, and never can have.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>To conceive of men in the <hi rend="italics">social state</hi> is to conceive of them in their relations to each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Hence it is a <hi rend="italics">complex</hi> state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Several ideas enter into this state &mdash; not only individuality, as in the former case, but also contiguity of time and place, variety, and often contrariety of relations, together with all the ideas which, as sequences, grow out of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Now, a leading idea involved in this state, and inseparable from it, is the idea of <hi rend="italics">government</hi>: <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>that is, the <hi rend="italics">political</hi> is inseparable from the social state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>These various and conflicting relations must be defined by certain rules, carrying the full idea of <hi rend="italics">control</hi>. Without this, these relations could not operate in harmonious agreement for a single day. Now, as the <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> state of man is the state for which he was made,--the state to which alone his entire nature is adapted,--there can be no dispute, the <hi rend="italics">social</hi> state is the <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> state of man. <quote>And the <name n="God" type="God">Lord God</name> said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him an helpmeet for him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>He was made, then, for society, and society was immediately furnished him. But the <hi rend="italics">law</hi> of relation, we find, was coincident with the relation itself: <quote>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/><rs type="role">Gen.</rs> <num value="2">II</num>. <num value="24">24</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>And so also, every <num value="1">one</num> born into the world was born in a state of society &mdash; the social state &mdash; and has always existed in this state : that is, <hi rend="italics">under government</hi>. But we have before proved that a state of slavery is fundamental in the <hi rend="italics">complex</hi> idea of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>There is, there can be, <hi rend="italics">no government without it</hi>. Therefore, the natural state of man, or the state to which he is adapted by both his mental and physical constitution, is a state of slavery in combination with liberty, <hi rend="italics">which is the complex idea of government</hi>. <pb id="p.70" n="70"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>This is the form in which <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0003.00070.00051" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> prefers to express the doctrine of equality.<note anchored="yes">

<p>Moral Science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Part <num value="2">II</num>., Division I &mdash; Reciprocity.</p></note> He explains himself thus: <quote>Each separate individual is created with precisely the same right to use the advantages with which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has endowed him as any other individual.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>From this position, as thus explained, he deduces an argument the force of which, without expressing it in so many words, is constructively made to pervade the whole performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>For his whole argument may be embodied thus: the government which places an individual in any other condition than that of political equality is an odious tyranny: the government which establishes domestic slavery does this, and is therefore an odious tyranny.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Now, the proposition, as he explains it, may be admitted as a truism; but then the doctrine of essential equality of right will not follow from such an admission: that is, social and political equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>For what if it be true that <quote>each separate individual has precisely the same right to use the advantages with which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has endowed him?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>It only follows that each <num value="1">one</num> has a <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>common right in this respect merely, but not that there is an essential equality of right in any available sense in which we are accustomed to understand the phrase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>For if so, it will follow that brutes have an essential equality of rights with men, and that both men and brutes have an essential equality of rights with angels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>This is not pushing the argument too far in either direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>For brutes, in a sense well defined by <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0003.00071.00052" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> himself, have rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>No <num value="1">one</num> but a <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> brute would deny the right of his fellow-creature &mdash; the brute &mdash; to appropriate an accessible bucket of refreshing water to slake his burning thirst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Nothing is more certain than that brutes, men, and angels have a common right to appropriate the advantages with which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has endowed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Brutes could not have lower, and angels could not have higher, rights in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>But surely it cannot be said that this common right confers on brutes, men, and angels, essential equality of rights in any practical sense whatever; for then it will follow that brutes, men, and angels have an equal right to social and political equality &mdash; a bold and reckless absurdity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>We admit that <num value="1">one</num> man has a common right with each and all other men in the respect stated; but not that they have common rights in other respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The common right to use our <quote><hi rend="italics">advantages</hi> <pb id="p.72" n="72"/><hi rend="italics">to promote our happiness</hi></quote> will not constitute us equals in any proper sense, unless our <hi rend="italics">advantages</hi> be equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>Now, <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0003.00072.00053" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> himself allows, in the very terms of his proposition, that men are <hi rend="italics">not equal in condition</hi>--that is, <hi rend="italics">not equal in advantages</hi>. And nothing is more obvious than that men are not equal in that intellectual and moral condition which would enable them to use certain social and political advantages for the benefit of themselves and others: consequently, upon his own admission, they would have no right to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Unless, then, it can be shown that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has endowed all human beings with intellectual and moral capacities sufficiently developed to enable them to be used for the common welfare, they have no right to what we call political freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>But it is unquestionable that men are not universally nor even generally so endowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>It is not the case with minors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Political freedom is withheld from them by the laws of all States, for the obvious reason that it is not among the privileges which <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, as yet, endowed them with the ability to use for the common welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Still, no <num value="1">one</num>, so far as we are aware, ever dreamed that minors were herein abridged of their natural rights, and that government and parents were <quote><hi rend="italics">odious tyrants</hi></quote> because they subjected them to <num value="1">one</num> of the known forms of domestic slavery!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>We are not surprised, <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>therefore, that <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0003.00073.00054" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> found himself compelled to admit that minors were exceptions to his rule; which, however, he had argued as universal &mdash; universals admit of no exceptions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Again, it is not true of barbarians, through any of the stages of barbarism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>At no period are they in that state of intellectual and moral development in which they could use for the common welfare the blessings of civil freedom, as understood and enjoyed by a highly civilized people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>If they were, they would not be barbarians, but a civilized people, to whom the right of civilization &mdash; political freedom &mdash; would inure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Now I assume here, what I shall prove in a future lecture, that the <name>African</name> came into this country in a state of extreme barbarism; and that, in the judgment of Southern people &mdash; whom prejudice itself can hardly deny are honest and the only competent judges in this matter &mdash; they are still as a race, in a state of semi-barbarism, to say the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>If we are right in this position, they also are an example of persons who are clearly not entitled to the rights which inure only to a state of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>With what propriety, therefore, could any decent man, whose object is not to insult, affirm that we are <quote>odious tyrants,</quote> for withholding from the <name>African</name> the rights which are appropriate only to a state of civilization: unless <pb id="p.74" n="74"/>he were prepared <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to show that we are wrong in our position as to the question of fact, that they are still in a state of semi-barbarism, and, therefore, not entitled to civil freedom?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>How shall we characterize the course of <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0003.00074.00055" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>After drawing an ingenious argument through many pages of his performance: appealing to the facts and principles of Holy Scripture: not failing, in the progress and application of his false position, to stigmatize the system of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery as an odious tyranny, and this for the obvious purpose of degrading the <rs>Southern States</rs> of this Union in the eyes of the whole civilized world: then, when he is confronted, as he necessarily was, in the progress of his own argument, by the only material fact in the whole discussion, he adroitly evades all consideration of it whatever!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>On <ref n="page 216">page 216</ref>, <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> edition, he states the position of the <rs>South</rs>, that the <quote>slaves are not competent to self-government,</quote> and shortly replies, <quote>This is a question of fact which it is not the province of <persName n="Philosophy,,Moral,,," id="n0062.0003.00074.00056" reg="default:Philosophy,Moral,,,"><foreName>Moral</foreName> <surname>Philosophy</surname></persName> to decide.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Why then did he decide it by an application of his false position to the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Echo answers, Why?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Had he confined the application of his principles to the rights which belong to a civilized people, we should have no cause to complain; or had he adduced facts to invalidate the position of the <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>South in regard to its <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> population, we should be bound to regard him as maintaining an honorable discussion; or, yielding this point, had he attempted to define that form of government most appropriate to a mass of semi-barbarians, dwelling in the midst of a highly civilized people, with whom they could not amalgamate; or, declining this, had he frankly confessed his incompetency (as indeed will really appear upon a discussion of his basis principle) to do justice to the subject of <persName n="Philosophy,,Moral,,," id="n0062.0003.00075.00057" reg="default:Philosophy,Moral,,,"><foreName>Moral</foreName> <surname>Philosophy</surname></persName> at this point at least &mdash; in either case we should be bound to respect his effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>But departing, as he evidently does, from all these obvious lines of duty in the pathway of his desolating errors, and inflicting so deep a wound upon the feelings of the whole Southern community, it must be allowed that our charity is heavily taxed in accounting for his course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>lie can have no cause to complain that we adopt the opinion that he has permitted an early prejudice to grow into a feeling of fanaticism, so fixed as to warp his judgment on points of very simple application in Moral Science.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Such a text-book, thus endorsed by both piety and learning put into the hands of our <pb id="p.76" n="76"/>young men, could rarely fail of its object &mdash; especially if the professor concur in enforcing its doctrines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>This is frequently the case in Northern institutions, and has often occurred in Southern; and where it has not, the professor, as a general thing, is either silent, or he concedes the <hi rend="italics">doctrines</hi> of the text, and rests the defence of the <rs>South</rs> upon the false position, that <quote>she cannot help herself!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>The assumption that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has placed men in circumstances in which they cannot avoid a violation of his own immutable principles of right, may be so entirely overlooked, as to leave the doctrines and arguments of the text to work an increasing conviction that there is moral wrong in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>there are questions which lie back of this discussion &mdash; errors, as I think, which underlie the popular ideas of both government and rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>We should not consider that we had fully met the difficulties of the subject if we passed them by.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Domestic slavery, it is said, is an abridgment of inalienable rights; and legitimate government is a voluntary concession of certain alienable rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Natural rights are, of course, such as are inherent in the constitution of man : inalienable, because in point of fact he cannot be substantively deprived of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>The law which in any case provides to <pb id="p.78" n="78"/>do this, treats him as though he were not a rational, but a mere sentient being &mdash; and therein alienates his rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Domestic slavery is said to treat the slave as a mere chattel, a thing, not an entity, and hence deprives him by provision of law of the right of being treated as a rational being as he is, and not a mere thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>This is said, because it places his time and labor at the disposal of another man. How far this reproach is just, turns upon a definite answer to the question--<hi rend="italics">What are rights</hi>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/><quote> <hi rend="italics">Government is a voluntary concession of certain alienable rights</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>If this concession be made by the majority of the citizens, the government is called republican; if otherwise, it is called despotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>In this theory of government, certain rights are assumed to be given up, in order to secure other and more important rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>I have shown government to embody, of.necessity, <num value="2">two</num> great abstract principles in harmonious operation &mdash; though, in their essential nature, the <num value="1">one</num> antagonizes the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>Now the principle of slavery--<hi rend="italics">control by the will of another</hi>--certainly operates an abridgment of the exercise of <hi rend="italics">self-control</hi>, which is the principle of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>And so far as the principle of slavery operates, in any given instance of government, is that, in such instance, a giving up, to that extent, of the right of <hi rend="italics">self-control</hi>, in order to secure a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to the <hi rend="italics">self-control</hi> which remains <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>ungiven up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Is this so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>This question, also turn upon the solution of that other question &mdash; What are rights?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>And again, <hi rend="italics">self-control</hi>, we say, is the principle of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Practical freedom is the exercise of the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> of self-control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>How far does the right of self-control extend?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>I say that an instance in which a body of men emerged from a state of nature, (so called,) and formed a government by an original act, is unknown to history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>It never occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Man was placed originally by Jehovah himself under political law. The very moment that he placed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> being in a relation to another by giving him a <quote><hi rend="italics">helpmeet</hi>,</quote> he gave him a law to govern that relation, as we have seen; and all the subsequent acts of men in the matter of government-making, have been such modifications of the existing form of government as they supposed would better suit their circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>But it is said that when society meets in convention to agree upon certain principles called a constitution, under which the laws shall be made, men do virtually, for the time being, resolve themselves into their original position or state without government; and that the constitution so formed is virtually an original formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Well, for the sake of the argument, let it be so. When, therefore, society thus falls back upon its original <pb id="p.80" n="80"/>position, men stand upon the basis of what are supposed their <hi rend="italics">original rights</hi>! What is that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Why, the right that each man has to do as he may please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>They form a government: that is, give up a part, more or less, of their <hi rend="italics">original right</hi>. Of course a part remains ungiven up, and the giving up cannot be to secure the possession of that which is already in possession!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>What is it that invests these questions with difficulty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Is it not the ambiguity of the term rights?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Let us then define <hi rend="italics">rights</hi>, if we would not be for ever entoiled by these absurdities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>And still again: Is liberty the right of self-control?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>Is not man &mdash; accountable man &mdash; free in virtue of his very humanity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>Does this freedom imply absolute liberty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>If so, absolute liberty is inherent in his very constitution &mdash; it is inalienable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>What right, then, can he have to give it up, or any part of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>If so, he has the right to do that which subjectively he cannot do. If, then, government be a concession of the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> of self-control in this sense, it is the concession of an inalienable right, and should be abandoned as a piece of folly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>It is entirely obvious, therefore, that we cannot advance in these inquiries at all without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settling the question, <hi rend="italics">What are rights</hi>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The <name>English</name> language is allowed to be <num value="1">one</num> of great power, compass, and accuracy, and therefore <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>eminently adapted to reasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>It derives this quality in a good degree from its flexibility, the different varieties of idea, and often the different shades of meaning in these varieties that may be expressed by <num value="1">one</num> word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>No language is supposed to compare with it in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>But whilst this adapts it to the purpose of correct reasoning, it opens also a wide field for errors in argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Men usually differ widely in <hi rend="italics">opinion</hi>, but they do not often differ in sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>All intelligent and good men <hi rend="italics">feel right</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">mean right</hi>. They often differ in opinion because they differ in the meaning they attach to the language, the same language, which is the medium through which each views the same subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>Different men use the same word in different senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>that the good always will be the good?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>That <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num> are equal to <num value="4">four</num>; that to affirm a thing to be and not to be at the same time is an absurdity and a contradiction; and that things equal to <num value="1">one</num> and the same thing are equal to <num value="1">one</num> another, we say are all intuitive truths &mdash; we cannot be mistaken about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>So also in morals: that the truth is good; that virtue is good; that a good action is not an evil action; and that to affirm that a good action is not a good action is an absurdity, a contradiction, we say, <hi rend="italics">are all intuitions &mdash; we cannot be mistaken about them</hi>. But is it not equally intuitive that these things were always so &mdash; that these truths were always truths &mdash; the good was always the good, just as certainly as that they are so <pb id="p.94" n="94"/>now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Then the <hi rend="italics">eternity</hi> of these things is just as certainly an intuition, as that they exist now is an intuition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>Hence the eternity of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who is the great impersonation of this high quality, or whose attribute it is, is an intuitive truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Hence his will did not make it, for it is absurd to say that he made himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>His will, therefore, which, in given cases, is his volition, is but the expression of this essential quality of his holy nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>Hence his will is a rule of right, because in all cases it conforms to the good, but it did not make the good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Therefore the right, as it conforms to the essential good, is of the nature of the good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>It is properly a significate of the good, and not a significate of the <hi rend="italics">will</hi> of <hi rend="italics"><name n="God" type="God">God</name></hi>. Things agreeing with <num value="1">one</num> and the same thing agree with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Hence it coincides with the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>But such coincidence does not constitute any thing <hi rend="italics">right</hi> in itself; but it is because, like the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, it conforms to, or is of the nature of, the essential good, <hi rend="italics">that it is right</hi>. The Rigit then, in itself, is the good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>The good is the true generic idea which classifies all the different applications of this term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>So far as any thing is of the nature of the good, it is in itself right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>So far as any thing, to which the idea of the right applies, is negative of then <hi rend="italics">good</hi>, i. e., is evil, it is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/><pb id="p.95" n="95"/></p> 
<p>The good, therefore, as an ultimate <hi rend="italics">genus</hi>, is much more extensive in meaning than the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>It extends to all <hi rend="italics">physical</hi> as well as <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Our subject requires us to consider it only so far as it applies to humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>And how far is this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>When Jehovah created man, he pronounced him to be <quote>very good,</quote> i. e., essentially good in the attributes of his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>He was created in <quote>his own image: in the image of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> created he him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/><quote>And the <name n="God" type="God">Lord God</name> formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and <hi rend="italics">man became a living soul</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>That is, he was created a pure spiritual intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>He had a clear and correct perception and judgment of pure abstract truth, and of the relations of truth; with the corresponding feelings of obligation to duty, and a power of will sufficient to control the mental states within the sphere of its operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Now, as a pure intelligence, thus endowed, he is within the limits of his capacity a cause within himself &mdash; strictly a self-acting agent, and hence accountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>And as he was created with a feeling of obligation to observe the good as a rule in all his conduct, he was created a subject of duty &mdash; he was under obligation to do, to act; and as in each of these respects, and in all others, he was created in conformity with the essential good, he was <hi rend="italics">rectus, right</hi>. All this is implied in <pb id="p.96" n="96"/>that declaration of his essential nature, as a pure spiritual intelligence, (who was therein made in the image of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,) which defined him to be <quote><hi rend="italics">very good</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Nor can we think of this good as a quality or attribute of humanity, without being conscious, if we reflect closely, of associating in our minds the idea that the being who personates it is for that reason <hi rend="italics">free;</hi> that for that reason he is <hi rend="italics">rectus, straight</hi>, conformed to the good as the rule, that is, <hi rend="italics">right;</hi> and that for the same reason he is under obligation &mdash; it is his <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> to act according to that rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Every instance of moral action that is good implies these ideas: it is <hi rend="italics">free</hi>, it is <hi rend="italics">rectus, straight</hi>, and it is done in accordance with <hi rend="italics">duty</hi>. In the same sense in which <hi rend="italics">life, sense</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">motion</hi> enter into and so form the comprehension of the creature, animal; so <hi rend="italics">liberty, rectitude</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> form the comprehension of moral good, so far as it applies to humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>These are distinct ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Still they coincide, and either implies the others as correlatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Hence we say of a <hi rend="italics">free</hi> action that it is <hi rend="italics">good</hi>, implying that it is at the same time <hi rend="italics">rectus</hi>, and done in accordance with duty; and of an action in conformity to a proper rule, that it is <hi rend="italics">good</hi>, implying at the same time that it is <hi rend="italics">free</hi>, and done in accordance with <hi rend="italics">duty;</hi> and also of an action in compliance with <hi rend="italics">duty</hi>, that it is <hi rend="italics">good</hi>, implying that it is also <hi rend="italics">free</hi>, and straight, i. e., <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>conformed to rule: thus in each case we imply the correlative ideas.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Now, whatever is in my possession by natural endowment is <hi rend="italics">mine</hi>, in the strictest sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Hence, <hi rend="italics">freedom</hi> is mine, <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> is mine, and <hi rend="italics">rectitude</hi> is mine, because the <hi rend="italics">good</hi> is mine, and those are the elements of the good, each <num value="1">one</num> implying the others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Hence arises the idea of <hi rend="italics">natural right</hi>: that is, the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> with which I am endowed by the constitution of my nature as a rational being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>But what is that right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Evidently, the <hi rend="italics">good</hi>. The good as an attribute is in my possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>I am constituted with it and by it. Hence it is inalienable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Divest me of the good as an attribute of my nature, i. e., liberty, rectitude, and duty, and I sink at once in the scale of being: I cease altogether to be a rational or accountable being.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Let no <num value="1">one</num> imagine that this position conflicts with the well-known fact that man is a fallen being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>For although fallen, he is still accountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>True, his moral nature is in ruins, but still it is a moral nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Though disordered, it is not eradicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Hence the restoration by grace is called a conversion; but if the essential moral nature of man had been destroyed by the fall, and an attribute of essential evil had taken the place of it, his restoration could not be called, as it is, a <pb id="p.98" n="98"/><hi rend="italics">change</hi>, but should be called in the strictest sense an <hi rend="italics">original</hi> creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Hence, although man is fallen, depraved &mdash; and we need not object to the strong terms in which this depravity is usually expressed &mdash; still we find that the sentiment of all mankind is on the side of virtue, on the side of the good; and that men, though unchanged by sovereign grace, are still required to be honest, gentlemanly, and in all things regardful of each other's rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>We admit of exceptions or modifications of this only in the case of those in whom humanity has not been fully developed, as before noticed, and those in civilized life who have so far abused their moral nature as, in the language of <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0062.0004.00098.00084" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>, to fit themselves for destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Therefore, it still remains that the <hi rend="italics">good</hi> in the form of rectitude, <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, is in some modification an endowment of my nature: the <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, in itself, is mine by nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>But the good, as an attribute, is an <hi rend="italics">active</hi> principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>We were endowed with it for the purpose of movement &mdash; for results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>It is my duty to act <hi rend="italics">right</hi>--straight or in accordance with the <hi rend="italics">good</hi> as a rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Hence, whatever is a necessary <hi rend="italics">condition</hi> of the operation of this active principle, the essential good, is in itself a good which is either in my possession, and hence is mine by possession; or it <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to be in my possession, and hence is mine <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>by just title, Hence, to breathe, under all circumstances, together with all physical motion and the sustenance of the body, which involves the right of property to a certain extent, each in given circumstances, is the natural right of every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>So also the right of the embryo-man, the idiot, the imbecile, the uncivilized, or the savage, to protection and defence, is a natural right; and for the same reason, to be protected and defended from certain helpless conditions by others, is the natural right of every <num value="1">one</num> in all states of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>Because each of these, and of all similar things, is in itself good, being a necessary condition of the operation of the essential good, and is either in our possession or ought to be in our possession; each <num value="1">one</num> is also a <hi rend="italics">natural right</hi>, the good that is or ought to be in our possession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>But there are <hi rend="italics">acquired rights</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>It is the <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> of man to act, from the very fact that he is endowed with the attribute of the <hi rend="italics">good</hi>, which envelops the idea of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>He also has <hi rend="italics">power</hi> to act from the very same natural constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Now, if he use this <hi rend="italics">power</hi> as duty and rectitude indicate that he should do, all nature teaches, what the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> confirms, that he will glorify <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, i. e., exemplify his goodness, and therein promote his own happiness and the happiness of those with whom he is associated; or, in <pb id="p.100" n="100"/>other words, he will secure for himself and confer upon his fellows eminent benefits resulting from the performance of his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Now, whatever results to him in this way is certainly his by possession, or by Divine grant, as much so as any natural <hi rend="italics">right;</hi> but these <hi rend="italics">benefits</hi>, being of the nature of the essential good, (for the reason that they are <hi rend="italics">benefits</hi>, are in themselves <hi rend="italics">right</hi>,) result to him in the performance of his duty, and therefore are <hi rend="italics">his rights</hi>. But the acquisition is made to depend upon the exercise of his <hi rend="italics">arbitrary</hi> volition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>If he use this in pursuance of duty, they follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>If he use it in violation of duty, they do not follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Hence, if he realize them at all, either by possession or by title, they are <hi rend="italics">acquired</hi>, and therefore are acquired <hi rend="italics">rights</hi> or benefits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Therefore, <hi rend="italics">acquired rights</hi> may be defined, such good, in the form of benefits or privileges, as results from the performance of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>Logically, they belong to the class of the essential good called benefits or privileges, with the <quote><hi rend="italics">essential difference</hi></quote> that they are such as result from the performance of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Any other result, though in itself of the nature of the essential good, yet, as it conferred no benefit, could not be said to be <hi rend="italics">our right</hi>. Capital punishment, for example, when in accordance with the <name>Divine</name> will, is in itself of the nature of the essential good; still, it would be an <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>abuse of language to say, in any ordinary case, that it was the right of the criminal to be hung!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>because for no reason that we can imagine does it confer any benefit or privilege upon the criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>To be <hi rend="italics">acquired rights</hi>, therefore, they must not only be of the nature of the good &mdash; that is, actual benefits &mdash; but this good must result from the performance of duty, and not from the non-performance of duty, as in the example given.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The definition corresponds with the language of common sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>All men, in speaking of cases which are supposed to involve the question of <hi rend="italics">rights</hi>, employ the term in this sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>You say, of a farmer in a given case, that he had no <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to an abundant harvest: why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>because he neglected his farm: his lands were not properly prepared, and the growing crop was left open to depredations from stock: that is, he neglected his duty; he had no <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to the benefit of an abundant harvest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>And again, you say to a neighbor, You should have paid a certain sum of money to A., in a given case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>He had a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to the money, because he complied with the conditions on which the money was to be paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/><hi rend="italics">He did his duty</hi>, and therefore had a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Thus, the neglect of duty negatives <hi rend="italics">right</hi> in the <num value="1">one</num> case, and the performance affirms it in the other, according to the common usage of language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/><pb id="p.102" n="102"/></p> 
<p>Another idea which clearly enters into the common and correct use of this term is that it is reciprocal with <hi rend="italics">obligation</hi>: that is, wherever there is a right in <num value="1">one</num> person, there is a corresponding obligation, <hi rend="italics">duty</hi>, upon others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>If <num value="1">one</num> man has a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to an estate, others are under obligation, that is, it is their <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> to abstain from it. If the letting of it alone be the result of duty on the part of others, the enjoyment of it by him must also result from duty on his part, or the ideas do not coincide: that which was duty in <num value="1">one</num> set of men would not be duty in another, in regard to the same thing, and in correlative circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>This would be absurd: therefore, the duty of <num value="1">one</num> set of men to let another alone in the enjoyment of a certain benefit, implies the correlative idea that they enjoy the benefit in virtue of doing their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Hence, those benefits which are our rights result to us from the performance of our duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The points established in this discussion are:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/><num value="1">1</num>. That conformity to what is <hi rend="italics">ordered</hi> or commanded is not the true generic idea of <hi rend="italics">the right</hi> in itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>What is ordered or commanded can only interpret <hi rend="italics">the right</hi>, when the command itself conforms to the essential good, as in the case of the <name>Divine</name> will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>This is always <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, because it so conforms, or is always an expression of the essential good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/><pb id="p.103" n="103"/></p> 
<p>Hence, <hi rend="italics">the good</hi> is the true generic idea of <hi rend="italics">the right</hi>. This alone can interpret <hi rend="italics">the right</hi> in any case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Therefore, although man, in virtue of his constitution as a pure intelligence, has the <hi rend="italics">power</hi> to do <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi> he has not, and never can have, <hi rend="italics">the right</hi> to do wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>For wrong is the negative of right; and any thing, whether attribute, quality, opinion, doctrine, or act &mdash; every thing, whether moral or physical &mdash; to be <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, must be of the nature of the <hi rend="italics">good</hi>: all else is <hi rend="italics">wrong, not right</hi>. And it farther follows, that the only true subjective <hi rend="italics">right</hi> which any man has to exercise his power of self-control, is in doing that which is good, and not in doing that which is evil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/><num value="2">2</num>. The <hi rend="italics">natural rights</hi> of man are,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>--The essential good in his possession by natural endowment, and which is therefore inalienable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>And, <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>--The necessary conditions, whatever they may be, of the operation of the inherent good as an active principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Some of these are inalienable, and others are alienable.

<item>civil government is not founded on a concession of rights.</item></list></p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>philosophers, it seems to me, strangely overlook the tendency of man's fall to modify the operation of the laws of mind; and those who admit the fall still overlook this fact, that the depravity of man's nature was the result of <hi rend="italics">deprivation</hi>, and not the infusion of an evil principle as an attribute of his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>But it is not with the theology of this subject that we are now dealing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>The fact that, as a fallen being, he was deprived of the immediate <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>presiding influence of the <rs>Divine Spirit</rs>, is the matter that more immediately engages our attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>His lower physical nature, the great medium of the soul's communication with the outward world, and of consciousness in the embodied state, <hi rend="italics">originally</hi> operated in perfect and harmonious subordination to his higher spiritual nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>In this condition, his appetites, propensities, and passions presented no bar to his happiness, or to that of his fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>The government or control which his situation demanded, we may suppose, was simple, and concerned chiefly his relation to the <name>Deity</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>But when, on the great occasion of his trial, he exercised his power of self-action, and exalted this nature as a rule of moral action, instead of the essential good of his higher nature, of which the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the given case was the full and just exponent, there resulted a deprivation of the <rs>Divine Spirit</rs>, such as entirely changed the relation of those departments of his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Under the clouded condition of intellect consequent upon this deprivation, his lower nature, with its appetites, propensities, and passions, is brought into constant and fierce conflict with his spiritual nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>This change in the condition of his humanity presents his case in an aspect altogether new. The history of each individual man becomes the history of a warfare &mdash; a warfare with <pb id="p.106" n="106"/>himself, and a warfare with his fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>With a highly vigorous moral nature, he is also the subject of a carnal or depraved nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>In this state of things, <hi rend="italics">government</hi> becomes an <hi rend="italics">actual necessity of his condition</hi>. The Divine government, with all the aids and appliances afforded by the grand scheme of atonement, must appeal to his passions, both of hope and of fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>For it is only by reducing his lower nature to its originally subordinate and harmonious position that an equilibrium will be established, and his primordial happiness regained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>But the <name>Divine</name> government, though operating in harmony with the claims of his moral nature, and founded upon the relation which he sustains to Jehovah, and indispensable to his happiness here and hereafter, of itself alone does not meet a great many of the immediate demands of his condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Hence the statement of <persName><foreName>Solomon</foreName></persName>: <quote>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>The consequences of obedience, high and holy as they are, and the consequences of disobedience, great and terrible as they are, are too remote from man, in many states of intellect and feeling in which he often places himself, to meet the immediate demands of his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Hence, that modification of government called civil government, is no less demanded <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>by the necessities of his condition than the <name>Divine</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Civil government deals chiefly with the relations of man to his fellow-man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>It coincides with the <name>Divine</name> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>They each aim at the control of the lower nature of man, and the development of his higher nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>The means they employ are the same in principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>They address the same passions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>The rewards and punishments of the <num value="1">one</num> are in this life, and of the other chiefly in the life to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Withal, the civil has the sanction of the <name>Divine</name>, and the <name>Divine</name> should always have the sanction of the civil, government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>But still they are entirely distinct, and should not be confounded, either in theory or in practice The <num value="1">one</num> is secular, and the other is Divine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Now, we say that civil government &mdash; for of that we are called more particularly to speak--<hi rend="italics">is a necessity of man's condition</hi>. It dates back as early as the creation of man. <name n="God" type="God">God</name> himself established it in the law he gave to govern the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> relation that existed on earth &mdash; the relation between <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0062.0005.00107.00085" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName> and his <quote>helpmeet.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>After the fall, a necessity arose which gave it a new and more important bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>We soon see it ramifying itself through all society, and dealing with all the relations of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>Its necessity and authority, as a great means of <pb id="p.108" n="108"/>controlling the lower nature of man, is among the permanent beliefs of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>Neither legislators nor philosophers originated these beliefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>They are among the intuitions of man. The common judgment of mankind is not more assured that man exists, than that fallen man must be controlled in his appetites, propensities, and passions &mdash; the sum of what is often considered his interest and his happiness &mdash; by the <hi rend="italics">physical powers of government</hi>. Each individual man feels that he needs its powerful sanctions to arm him against himself, when violently tempted to do wrong; and that he needs its sanctions to protect him from outrage and wrong from his fellow-men, when moved by similar forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>The instincts of animal nature are not more certain in their movements than are the <hi rend="italics">intuitive</hi> perceptions and spontaneous feelings of mankind, causing them to lean upon the strong arm of civil government, to <hi rend="italics">control</hi> the propensities and passions, and to promote the free exercise of the higher moral nature of man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>Government is the whole society in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>No people was ever known to exist for any definite period without government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Sometimes, it is true, <hi rend="italics">the form</hi> has been the result of implied understandings among the people &mdash; as when <quote>there was no judge in <placeName key="tgn,1000119" n="1.000 3" reg="yisra'el">Israel</placeName>:</quote> at others, a master-spirit has assumed the reins, and been deferred to by <pb id="p.109" n="109"/>common consent; and at others, it has been modified by formal processes &mdash; such as conventions and constitutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Be this, however, as it may, government has always existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Legislators did not make it. They have had much to do in modifying, directing, and often in corrupting the form; but nothing to do in originating government, in any proper sense of the term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>It sprang spontaneously from the common sense of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>An agent indispensable to self-preservation was certainly coeval with the race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>In its true generic sense, that is, in a sense equally applicable to all forms, government is <hi rend="italics">control</hi> by the authority of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in his word, declares the authority of the magistrate to be his ordinance; and this accords with the intuitive belief and feeling of necessity of all mankind: not that either approves in all cases of the <hi rend="italics">form</hi> which government assumes, but that the generic principle, in all cases, has the sanction of each.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>The legitimate object of government is to secure to the people the highest amount of freedom which their moral condition and relative circumstances will admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>The means which it employs to effect this object, are, <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Suitable penalties, addressed to their hopes and fears, to lay them under such restraints as to the indulgence of their appetites, <pb id="p.110" n="110"/>propensities, and passions, as thereby to prevent them from operating as a bar to the free exercise of their intellectual and moral powers in pursuit of the <hi rend="italics">essential</hi> good; and, <num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>The security which it offers to every man, in the exercise of the higher powers of his nature, that he may do it without restraint from the passions of men; or, in other words, to guarantee to every man the free exercise of his essential power to do good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>That both the object of government, and the means which it employs, are correctly stated, will not be disputed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>All men concur in these views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>They underlie all our opinions and reasonings on the subject of civil government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>But in assenting to this much, (and how can it be avoided?) may we not stand committed to much more than many theoretical politicians are aware?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Let us trace the logical inferences which arise from the principles discussed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>I. Man, we find, is endowed with a self-acting power of will, which is called mental liberty, and hence he is accountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>For although it is admitted that there cannot be a volition without a motive, yet it is an idea inseparable from our notions of mental liberty, that there cannot be any thing in these motives necessitating the volition; for in that case it would not be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>But he is free to adopt either the right or the wrong motive <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>of volition, and therefore he is accountable for his actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>Nor does it follow that this liberty confers the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to do <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>. His liberty, as we have shown, is to be understood in a sense agreeing with the coincident ideas of <hi rend="italics">right</hi> and <hi rend="italics">duty</hi>. We are all conscious, that so soon as we perceive <hi rend="italics">the good</hi>, in any case, we have a feeling of <hi rend="italics">obligation</hi> to observe it as the rule of conduct, and to avoid the contrary as <hi rend="italics">wrong;</hi> that is, <hi rend="italics">each man has a conscience</hi>. Hence, although man has the <hi rend="italics">power</hi> to do wrong, he has no <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to do wrong; but only a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to do that which is good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>Such, and such only, is the true subjective <hi rend="italics">right of self control</hi>. It is not a right to do as we may please, unless we shall please to do that which, in itself, is <hi rend="italics">right;</hi> that is, <hi rend="italics">the good</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/><num value="2">II</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>His fall, we have seen, has had the effect to place him in such circumstances, that the attributes of his lower nature, his appetites, propensities, and passions, often have such ascendency as motives of action, that he is always liable to do wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Many reasons, <hi rend="italics">&agrave; priori</hi>, could be given for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>The mind is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought into contact with the outward world through the bodily senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>They come <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> into play; and hence the natural sensibilities are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The will, in the form of spontaneous volition, is accustomed, from earliest life, to act from these as a motive, for the reason <pb id="p.112" n="112"/>that there is no other from which it can act. The pure intelligence, the percipient of the good, and the corresponding feelings of obligation, unfold themselves slowly; and long before it may be said that the mind is matured, the will is accustomed to make the natural sensibilities the motive of spontaneous volition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Now the will is, like all other faculties of the mind, subject to the great law of habit; and if not checked, restrained according to the true idea of government, a <hi rend="italics">habit</hi> of submission is formed, which, if not early dissolved, becomes a confirmed habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>The will, instead of being the governing power of the mind, becomes, in truth, the faculty governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/><hi rend="italics">It has lost the power of self-control</hi>. It has become the slave of passion &mdash; confirmed in the habit of submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>It is precisely at this point of mental degradation that <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0062.0005.00112.00086" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> declares of <quote>vessels of wrath,</quote> those who have brought themselves into this state by their own act, that <quote>they are fitted to destruction.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>Now, in view of these facts and the principles already established, what are the rights of man?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>In the state of infancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>It has been proved that the subjective endowments of humanity, and whatever is necessary to their existence and operation, are the <hi rend="italics">natural right of man</hi>. That the undeveloped good is the endowment of this form of humanity will not be disputed: hence <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>whatever is necessary to its existence and operation, is the natural right of infants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>But it is obvious that a governing power, existing some where, is indispensably necessary in the case of the child; that is, a power must exist sufficiently potent to control the spontaneous volitions of the will, or, in the circumstances of its position, it will probably extinguish its own liberty, by the law of habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Government, then,--absolute government,--is necessary to the existence and operation of the endowment of humanity in the state of infancy; and therefore absolute government is the <hi rend="italics">natural right of the infant</hi>. Hence all civil governments have exercised (so far as the will and physical condition are concerned) an absolute despotism over the child, and have recognized the parent, or some <num value="1">one</num> appointed in the place of the parent, as the agent of its functions in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Not to accord to the infant this extreme form of control, would be a practical denial of its natural rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Therefore this extreme form of despotism, so far from being a curse, is the natural right of infants &mdash; the good to which they are entitled by nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>And again, the civil government accords to the child a progressive modification of this form of government under given circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>It requires its agent to relax the stringency of this control, and to extend a privilege of self-control, <pb id="p.114" n="114"/>in the ratio in which the pure intelligence and feelings of obligation or duty are <hi rend="italics">practically</hi> developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>For a child who had become, to a certain extent, a subject of duty, and was disposed to fulfil this duty, but was kept, <hi rend="italics">per force</hi>, in the physical condition of infancy until he lost the use of his limbs, would be considered as deprived of the right of self-control to that extent, and thereby cruelly treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>The agent in such a case would be severely punished, and the child committed to other hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Hence, in the ratio in which the pure intelligence is unfolded, and feelings of obligation arise, or conscience is developed, and becomes the practical rule of action, the individual <hi rend="italics">acquires</hi> the right of self-control, and only in that ratio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>This right may ultimately reach to all things in themselves good &mdash; the civil government always holding the authority to punish departures from duty, and thereby always abridging men of the moral power to do wrong, (because it never could be their right to do wrong,) and always fortifying them in the right exercise of liberty of will, by furnishing motives, addressed to their intelligence and passions, to observe the right and to avoid the wrong in the exercise of the volitive power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Therefore, the <hi rend="italics">natural right of man</hi> is the right to such absolute control by others, in the earlier <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>periods of his life, as that his will may retain its self-acting power unimpaired, as his mind is naturally unfolded by time and circumstances; and to such modification of this absolute control in after life, as may afford him due restraint under temptation to do wrong, and proper encouragement, at all times, to do right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>. <hi rend="italics">The right of man in a state of maturity</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/><num value="1">1</num>. The government should accord him all his natural rights, and protect him in the exercise of the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>That is, the political government should cooperate with the <name>Divine</name> to preserve his will in its normal condition as a self-acting power, and to guarantee to him the exercise of this power of self-action in all things good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>The man who is protected in the enjoyment of this inherent liberty of will, is a free man in the strictest sense of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>The government over him may be concentrated in the hands of <num value="1">one</num> man, or it may be divided among an aristocracy, more or less numerous, or it may be what is called a democracy, but this does not of itself affect the fact of his freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>If the government secure him in the enjoyment of these rights, and of all which necessarily attaches to them, he is essentially free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>The kind of government, as a hereditary monarchy, or a democratic republic, does not, of itself, determine the actual freedom of its subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>History furnishes <pb id="p.116" n="116"/>many examples of government in which the power of control was concentrated in the hands of but <num value="1">one</num>, or of a few individuals, which afforded its subjects the highest amount of essential liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>To this day, <quote><hi rend="italics">the freedom of the <orgName n="British Constitution" type="newspaper">British Constitution</orgName></hi></quote> --as much as we justly prefer our own &mdash; is by no means an idle boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>It is a great mistake to suppose that a government which deposits the sovereignty among the great mass of the people, is the only free government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>We are constrained to acknowledge that it is better to be oppressed by <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi>, or by a few tyrants, than by a multitude of tyrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>It is not <hi rend="italics">this</hi> or <hi rend="italics">that kind</hi> of government that makes the subject essentially free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>But it is the fact that the controlling power, whether wielded by <num value="1">one</num> or by many, secures each man in the enjoyment of his natural rights &mdash; affords him that system of appliances which develops and matures the self-acting power of his will &mdash; discourages all abuse of this power, and fully protects him in the proper exercise of it in the pursuit of the essential good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/><hi rend="italics">It is this that makes him free</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>We prefer, for those to whom it is applicable, a democratic republic; because it is a more secure government, and less liable to an abuse of power; not because it is necessarily a more free government than any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Another form of government may secure equal freedom in every essential <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>particular; and this form may be as oppressive as any other; and whenever it is so, the condition of the down-trodden minority is far more hopeless than is that of the oppressed majority under some other form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Still, in certain conditions of the people, it is a much more secure form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>The sovereigns of a state should always be socially equal, and, at the same time, honest as well as intelligent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Such rulers will not be oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>If the sovereigns of a democracy are intelligent, for the reason that but few participate directly and personally in the administration of government and the spoils of office they have but few inducements to corruption, and are more likely to be honest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>The mass of the people, though often wrong in opinion, are always right in sentiment &mdash; they mean to do right, and they desire to do right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>If they do err in a given case, they may usually be set right, for they have no motive to stay wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>Hence, we think that when the condition of intelligence is fulfilled in the case of those occupying a social footing, we may expect a wiser and purer government; whilst the extent to which they may participate in the affairs of government, giving it a firmer hold upon their affections, cannot fail to make it a more secure government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>It is widely different in the case of a government concentrated in the hands of <pb id="p.118" n="118"/>a few. The sovereigns are at the same time the administrators of law. They share not only the honors of sovereignty, but also the immediate profits of sovereignty &mdash; the spoils of office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Temptations to abuse power are always present and active.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>Hence we find that such governments are more frequently oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Withal, even in cases in which they are not, (for they need not be,) for the reason that the mass of the people do not immediately participate in the affairs of government, they are not as devoted to its interests, and hence the government cannot be as secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>For these reasons, a democratic republic is called by way of eminence a <hi rend="italics">free government;</hi> but, evidently, not because it is the only form which secures freedom to its subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Any of these forms are legitimate when they are so adapted to the condition of the people as to secure to them the highest amount of freedom of which that condition will admit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/><num value="2">2</num>. The government should secure to him all his acquired rights, or the rights which he acquires by the proper use of his essential rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Of these, we notice,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/><num value="1">1</num>. His rights of social equality with those with whom he holds common interests, pleasures, benefits, happiness, and duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>These rights usually vary with the condition of different individuals, <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>or different classes of individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>It will not be maintained that an infant or idiot, and a man of rude intellect and vulgar habits, have interests and duties common to each other, and common to persons in a different condition, in any such sense as would entitle them all to social equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Both their mental and physical condition would be a bar to any such equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>So in the case of the sexes, difference in physical condition is a bar, except in the marriage state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>So also certain races of men are by their physical condition barred from social equality, in many respects, with those of other races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Those duties required by <num value="1">one</num> condition in order to attain the essential good are very different from those of another condition which are necessary to attain the same object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>But the privilege of social equality with all in a similar condition, which results from the discharge of the duties of that condition, is the right of every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>Some will require positive law to secure them; as in the marriage relation, the social as well as other rights of the parties must be secured by law; whilst others will be better secured by leaving them to be regulated by the conventional usages of society &mdash; only another form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>But there is an obvious difference in the social rights of men which government is bound to respect, unless it would arrest the progress <pb id="p.120" n="120"/>of civilization; because it is an inequality founded in that difference of condition, against which no government can provide, nor was it intended that it should provide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>We notice,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/><num value="2">2</num>. That government should secure to him all those political rights to which he is entitled by making a proper use of his essential rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>We need not specify all the political rights which may be regarded acquired rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>It is sufficient to consider this topic in regard to the question of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>We say, that all the members of a given society, having a common interest in that society, are entitled to share the sovereignty of its government <hi rend="italics">on certain conditions, and on no other conditions</hi>. We take the ground that mere humanity, in itself considered, does not entitle any <num value="1">one</num> to the rights of political sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>If this were so, we should be bound to place females, together with minors of both sexes, and the inmates of State prisons, among the sovereigns of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>They are all perfect specimens of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it may be said, they are often equal in intellect with the other sex, and in other respects are generally superior specimens of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>These all have an interest in society common to all other members of it, and yet it is admitted that they should not be numbered among the sovereigns of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>What is it, <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>then, that entitles a man to the right of political sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>--He should have reached that point in mental development in which he will have a capacity, in common with others, to understand and appreciate the leading principles of government and their applications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>--He should have reached that period in life in which there is usually a corresponding development of the moral sense &mdash; the feeling of obligation to do right &mdash; which affords a reasonable guaranty for the faithful application of his knowledge in discharging the duties of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>--He should be in that state of social equality which gives him a common interest, a common happiness, and common duties as a citizen, with other sovereigns, which will also afford a necessary guaranty for the faithful performance of his duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>And, <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>--He should be in that physical condition, also, which is necessary to the duties of so responsible a position, under all ordinary circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>If <num value="1">one</num> or more of these conditions exclude a whole sex, together with all minors, idiots, felons, and foreigners, they at the same time limit it to a definite class of males, and bar all others from any title to it. No sensible man would admit that the power of sovereign control inherent in government could, with safety to the only legitimate object of government, the happiness of the subjects, <pb id="p.122" n="122"/>be deposited with any other class of men. But those who fulfil these conditions have right to rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>They have acquired it by the performance of those duties which have elevated them to the condition of being qualified for sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>It should not be withheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>If those in a society qualified for sovereignty be numerous the government should take the popular form &mdash; a democratic republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>But if those qualified to rule are a limited portion of the whole society, some other form of government is more appropriate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>But our subject leads us to notice:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>. <hi rend="italics">The rights of man in the savage or uncivilized state</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>No savage community was ever known to rise unaided to a state of civilization; and every example of savage society furnishes evidence that it is a state into which they have fallen by the tendencies of depraved nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>They are instances in which the government originally enjoyed &mdash; both human and Divine &mdash; has failed to preserve to the individual that liberty of will in the pursuit of the good which government is designed to secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>The pure intelligence is not sufficiently developed to constitute an enlightened conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Dwelling apart from civilized society, the absence of all the artificial wants of civilization is highly favorable to many of the natural virtues &mdash; such as hospitality <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>to strangers, truth, fidelity, and generosity to their friends; but the undeveloped state of the pure reason leaves the moral sense in a state of so much immaturity, as to characterize them as unfaithful, cruel, and revengeful to their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>These are characteristics which, in their condition of physical maturity, make them terrible to their neighbors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Now the question is, What are the rights of such a people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>It is useless to discuss this question so far as it relates to mere savage government; for in this view it is a question of no interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>But the question, What rights can they claim of a civilized people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>is the <num value="1">one</num> with which we have to deal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>They certainly have a natural right to protection under given circumstances, and freedom from oppression under all circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>If a civilized people, holding a balance of power in virtue of superior intelligence, have an undisputed right to protect themselves from the cruelty and infidelity of neighboring savages, still it will be admitted that oppression in any proper sense of the term would be an invasion of their natural rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>They have a right to be left in the enjoyment of he highest amount of freedom which their mental tate will allow them to use legitimately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>And lore than this, their natural rights claim for them <pb id="p.124" n="124"/>reasonable exertions to elevate their moral condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>Hence the noble efforts now being made by the <rs>Christian</rs> people of this country to evangelize the savages on our border, and the no less commendable efforts of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> to favor this design, by an annual appropriation from the national treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>All this is only according them their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>But do these rights entitle them to claim social equality with a civilized people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>That which it is the right of another to clair of me, it is my duty to grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>Is it then my duty to grant social equality to any or to every wandering savage that may chance to pass my dwelling?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>Should I not only extend to him the rights of hospitality due to a wandering savage &mdash; give him food and shelter in given circumstances, and treat him kindly in all respects &mdash; but extend to him true social equality, such as it is my duty to do to other men in certain states of civilization!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>No man &mdash; himself not a savage &mdash; would dare affirm this!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>The savage has no right to claim it. The reason is obvious on the principles discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>Certain social rights arise only on certain conditions of moral development, and the fulfilment of the duties which attach to that state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The savage has not reached this condition; hence has not fulfilled its duties, and is not entitled to the right of social equality which attaches to that state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>For <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>a sensible man to affirm that he has this right in virtue of his mere humanity, would be simply ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>And this being so, it follows, <hi rend="italics">a fortiori</hi>, that it is much less our duty to allow him an equal participation in the sovereignty of the <rs>State</rs>--allow him a control in the affairs of government &mdash; share the authority to regulate our relations domestic and foreign; and even to participate in governing our families.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>The man who should gravely propose in Congress to annex the savage tribes of our border, as sovereign States of this Union, would, by all right-minded men, be regarded as insane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>No <num value="1">one</num> of the managers of looms, spindles, and other machinery, among the agrarian portion of our northern community, with all their boasted knowledge of the natural rights of man, and their readiness to accord equal rights to all men, and to protect them in asserting those rights, have, as yet, made up their minds to go thus far &mdash; although we may be at a loss to account for it that they so far falsify their principles as not to do so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Now, as it is not our duty to do this in behalf of a neighboring race of uncivilized people, for the reason that they have no right to it, how does the question stand in regard to a numerous class of such persons, spread through a definite section of our country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Does this change of position and <pb id="p.126" n="126"/>contact with civilization confer on them higher rights than it has already been admitted belong to them in a separate state in virtue of their humanity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Is it our duty to accord to them equality of political rights?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>and for the reason that they are diffused through the mass of society?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Can this position be maintained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>On the contrary, the change of position, and the service which in that position they render to the cause of civilization, which is assumed to acquire for them a right that does not belong to their class of persons in a separate position, so far from affording a vindication of this doctrine, furnishes a still stronger reason against it. They are not only uncivilized, but are now in a position to exert an evil influence, which in a separate state they could not do, although they might dwell upon our border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>In a separate state, the artificial wants of civilized life are unknown to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>The great sources of temptation to do wrong by invading the rights of neighbors, is not supplied to them by their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>But when in immediate contact with civilization, a great many of these artificial wants are learned by them, and felt to be objects of desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>These desires, by a fixed law of the human mind, must be a constant source of temptation &mdash; they clamor for gratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>If the indulgence should not be restrained, either by a system <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>of laws which reached the case, or by the motives which a state of civilization supplies, they would inevitably result in a disregard of the rights of property, and a general depravation of morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>They are without the latter, for they are uncivilized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Hence the demands of their position must be met by laws appropriate to an uncivilized people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>The laws appropriate to a state of civilization, cooperating as they do with the motives supplied by that state, are not more than equal to the task of restraining the passions of civilized men. To rely upon them in the case of uncivilized men would be the grossest folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Hence if it were not our duty to share our political rights with such a people, dwelling upon our border, in a separate state, for a much stronger reason it is not our duty to do this for those dwelling in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>If it is not our duty to do it, it cannot be their right to claim it; for rights and duties are always reciprocal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>But, on the contrary, for the same general reasons by which it becomes the duty of a civilized state to place all its minors under the despotism of parental control, as before defined, it is the duty of the state to place an uncivilized race which may chance to dwell within its borders, under a similar form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>This despotism need not be oppressive in the <num value="1">one</num> case any more than in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>It is the proud boast of <pb id="p.128" n="128"/>all our native citizens that they have always lived under a free government; and yet they were brought up to the age of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> under a pure despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>But this does not deprive them of their right to boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>True, the government conferred almost absolute control upon the parent, or guardian, or master of the apprentice!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>These might have oppressed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>But the government, which stood ready to vindicate their rights, did not do it. The government, in what it did, only accorded them their natural rights, as we have seen &mdash; provided to confer on them the highest amount of freedom of which their condition would admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>It was to them essentially a free government, though in <num value="1">one</num> of the forms of despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>So in that form of despotism appropriate to a race of uncivilized people dwelling in the midst of a civilized people, if adapted to their condition, or securing to them (as in the case of minors) their natural rights, it is, <hi rend="italics">for</hi> them, and <hi rend="italics">to</hi> them, a <hi rend="italics">free government</hi>. So far from being a curse, as many of our philosophers teach, it is a blessing, which their essential rights entitle them to claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Any other form of government would be, in their case, as well as in that of minors, a practical denial of their rights; because it would result in the annihilation of their essential rights; that is, the enslavement of their wills to the basest passions of fallen nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/><pb id="p.129" n="129"/></p> 
<p>Hence, we find that government, both human and Divine, is a special necessity of man's fallen condition, and coeval with the history of the race: that its legitimate object is to preserve him from that annihilation of his essential liberty of will which would inevitably follow if there were no government, and to secure him in the enjoyment of the highest amount of this liberty which his condition will allow: that to do this, various forms of civil government are admissible; and that the <num value="1">one</num> best adapted to the condition of the people is the <num value="1">one</num> that should be applied, and is the only strictly <hi rend="italics">free government</hi> for the people to whom it is appropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>A democracy applied to minors or savages, in the midst of a civilized people, would be the most grinding of all oppressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>We have seen that the <hi rend="italics">means</hi> appropriate to government are suitable penalties addressed to our passions of hope and fear: that the only <hi rend="italics">right</hi> which a man has to exercise his inherent liberty &mdash; that is, the only right he has of self-control &mdash; is the authority to do that which, in itself, <hi rend="italics">is right</hi>--not a right to do <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>: that the exclusive authority of government is to restrain man from doing <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, and to protect and encourage him in doing <hi rend="italics">right</hi>--restrain his <hi rend="italics">power</hi> to do wrong, not his power to do right &mdash; this it seeks to strengthen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>We have seen that the rights of man in a state of <pb id="p.130" n="130"/>minority &mdash; and the same of uncivilized men dwelling in a community of the civilized &mdash; are to the benefits of an absolute form of government; any other would be only a system of ruinous oppression to them: that at his maturity as a civilized man, he should be protected in the exercise of all the rights which naturally belong to a state of maturity, and also the enjoyment of all those rights which he has acquired by availing himself of the privileges afforded by his condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>Of his acquired rights, we see that on certain conditions he is entitled to social equality; and that on certain further conditions, he is entitled to the right of political sovereignty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Now, we ask, in what sense can it be said that legitimate government is a concession of some rights, in order to secure others?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Certainly, in no good sense, seeing it only limits his power to do <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, by laying him under suitable disabilities, and that it does this in order to secure both the power and the privilege of doing right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>But by falsely assuming that government is a concession of rights, and that the government in which every citizen does not make a voluntary concession of the rights exercised by government is a cruel oppression, men fall upon conclusions which, when carried out, (and principles will tend to work out their results,) lead to agrarianism: that is, the <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>destruction of all rights, by the annihilation of all civilization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>And again we ask, How does it follow that the domestic slavery of the negro in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> is an abridgment of his inalienable rights?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>Certainly not from the fact that he is placed under an absolute form of control, for we have seen that, in certain conditions of humanity, that is the only form of government that will secure any freedom at all: as in the case of all minors, and the case of an uncivilized race that may chance to be diffused among the mass of a civilized people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>If, then, his government be an oppression at all, it is because his state of civilization, and the relative circumstances of his condition, have acquired for him the <hi rend="italics">rights of social equality</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">rights of political</hi> sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>These are questions of fact that will be considered in their proper place. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>the inquiry, if the institution of domestic slavery existing amongst us agrees in its <hi rend="italics">details</hi> with the teachings of the <rs>Holy Scriptures</rs>, is reserved for a future lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>We now inquire how far it agrees with the <rs>Holy Scriptures</rs> in its great fundamental principles?--the abstract principles which, thus far, have been shown to be right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>We, of course, acknowledge the full authority of the <name>Scriptures</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>Although not a formal philosophical treatise, the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> embodies no other than the profoundest principles both of mental and moral science; and all its teachings are in accordance <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/><quote>To the law,</quote> then, <quote>and to the testimony.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Do they sanction the principles I have sought to establish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Do they accord to man any other subjective right of self-control than simply the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to do that which in itself is <hi rend="italics">right</hi>--that is, <hi rend="italics">good</hi>? True, they assume that he has the <hi rend="italics">power</hi> to do wrong, but at the same time they deny to him <hi rend="italics">all right</hi> to do wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>All those scriptures which forbid his doing <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, and enjoin it upon him to do <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, under severe penalties for disobedience, are in proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>They are too numerous and familiar to require that I quote them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>They all assume that he has power to do either <hi rend="italics">right</hi> or <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, but only a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to do that which is <hi rend="italics">right</hi>. Whoever, then, sets up a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to do a thing, and can give no better reason for it than that he has power to do it in virtue of his humanity, and that therefore others should not interpose obstacles in the way of his doing it; on peril of abridging him of a natural right, assumes far more than the <name>Scriptures</name> allow him; nay, he assumes that which is forbidden him in Holy Scripture, no less than in reason and common sense; and if allowed to exercise such lawless power, under the plea of <hi rend="italics">natural right</hi>, he could not fail to put an end to all law, and to precipitate society into a state of anarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Therefore, the government which places minors, aliens, and <pb id="p.134" n="134"/>citizens, who at the same time allow themselves to be subjects of a foreign prince, together with uncivilized persons, in circumstances in which they cannot, or are not likely, to injure their neighbors, or to injure society, does not, for that reason, deprive them of a <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> right, unless it could be shown that they have a natural right to do the very thing which the <name>Scriptures</name> declare they have no right to do, that is, to injure their neighbors!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>It further follows, that the right to do an act which involves accountability, is the right to do that which, <hi rend="italics">in itself, is right;</hi> or, in other words, the only natural right of self-control is the right to do that which is good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>Hence, those who claim for any class of society a right to political sovereignty, should be prepared to show that the essential good requires that such privilege be accorded them, or they fail to establish their right, for the reason that no right can ever be justly <hi rend="italics">acquired</hi> which does not coincide with the natural right to do good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>Again, we have shown that the abstract principle of slavery is control by the will of another, with its correlatives: that this is an essential element of all government; for a government which did not exercise the right to control men, even against their wills, under given circumstances, would be no government at all. Do these views accord <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>with the teachings of the <rs>Holy Scriptures</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>That control is an. essential idea of government, is an intuitive perception, and needs no proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>The question then resolves itself into this: Do the <name>Scriptures</name> sanction government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>That the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> itself is only a system of government, will not be disputed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>It <hi rend="italics">forbids</hi> and <hi rend="italics">commands</hi>, and requires all men to conform their volitions to its requirements, as to that which is in itself good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Moreover, it sanctions civil government in the most express terms: <quote>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>For there is no power but of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>: the powers that be are ordained of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power,</quote> that is, the authority of government, <quote>resisteth the ordinance of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation,</quote> etc. (Rom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/><num value="13">XIII</num>. <num value="1">1</num>-<num value="7">7</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>See <persName n="Clarke,,A.,,," id="n0062.0006.00135.00090" reg="default:Clarke,A.,,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>'s notes.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>In that government, it is well known, the slavery element greatly predominated: but little room was left for the exercise of self-control; political sovereignty being denied to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>In declaring government, even in this extreme form of controlling the wills of men, to be his appointment, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> establishes the <hi rend="italics">principle, as in itself right</hi>. <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0006.00135.00092" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>, however, (see article, Modes in which Personal Liberty <pb id="p.136" n="136"/>may be violated,) affirms, <quote>that the gospel is diametrically opposed to the <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> of slavery.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The moral precepts of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, which he assumes to be diametrically opposed to the principle of slavery, are, (as quoted by himself,) <quote>Thou shalt love <hi rend="italics">thy neighbor as thyself;</hi> and <hi rend="italics">all things whatsoever</hi> ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>He says that, <quote>were this precept obeyed, it is manifest that slavery could not in fact exist for a single instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>The <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> of the precept is absolutely subversive of the <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> of slavery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>That the gospel should, nevertheless, acknowledge slaveholders (for neither the <name>Jewish</name> nor the <rs>Roman</rs> law <hi rend="italics">required</hi> any citizen to hold slaves) as <quote><hi rend="italics">believers</hi>,</quote> and <quote><hi rend="italics">worthy of all honor</hi>,</quote> and require of the <rs>Christian</rs> slaves held by them to acknowledge them as <hi rend="italics">brethren</hi>, that is, good men, and accord them <hi rend="italics">all honor</hi>, is evidently a troublesome question to the <rs>Doctor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>There is no room for surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> scripture quoted, it is allowed, interprets the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>In what sense then are we to understand the duty inculcated in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>There are only <num value="2">two</num> senses in which the form of the expression will allow us to evolve any significance whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is, Do unto another whatsoever you would have him to do unto you, if you were in his situation; and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is, <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>Do unto another whatsoever you would have a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to require another to do unto you, if you were in his circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>Now if we could suppose that the <name>Saviour</name> intended his language to be understood in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sense, it will not perhaps be disputed that it is our duty to abolish domestic slavery, for we should, no doubt, desire to be released, if we were in a state of domestic slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>But, unfortunately for the argument, this interpretation would not stop at the abolition of domestic slavery in the case of the <name>African</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>It would reach to the domestic slavery of the child also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>There is scarcely a wayward lad in Christendom who could not justly claim release from parental restraint on the same principle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>Nay, more, the criminal at the bar of civil justice, the inmates of State prisons, and the poor man in his hovel, would all claim release!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>And as that which is duty in others, in such cases, is a right in them, not to grant them release would certainly be a denial of their just rights!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Is this the sense in which <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0006.00137.00093" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> would have us understand the <name>Saviour</name> of mankind?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>Certain it is, that this is the only sense in which his words can be understood so as to involve the necessary abolition of slavery!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>We cheerfully acquit Dr. W. from the purpose to teach any such agrarian folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>Still, we can see no good reason why <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.138" n="138"/>so eminent, as a Christian and a scholar, should permit even an early prejudice as to a practical question, about which he allows that he is uninformed, to betray him into such views of a plain principle as logically involve him in the grossest absurdities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>That the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> sense given is the proper <num value="1">one</num> in which to understand the <rs>Saviour</rs>'s doctrine can admit of no dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>What we should have a <hi rend="italics">right to claim</hi>, if we were in the circumstances of a slave, is precisely that which we are to accord to such slave, according to the precept of the <name>Saviour</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>If we should have a right to claim political sovereignty, in those circumstances, we are bound to allow them such sovereignty, that is, release them from slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>This directly involves the question, Whether they are fitted for that self-government which is involved in such sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>That they are not so in virtue of their humanity merely, we have proved; and whether they are so or not, by acquirement, is a practical question which <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0006.00138.00094" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> allows that he is not competent to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>This question will be met in another place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>It is sufficient here to state, that the scripture so confidently relied on as repudiating the principle of slavery, is found not to reach the question of the principle at all, and, therefore, is wholly misapplied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>The patriarchal form of government, which existed <pb id="p.139" n="139"/>before the theocracy of the <name>Jews</name>, constituted the patriarch (he being the head of the family) the owner of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>These men enjoyed the unqualified approbation of Jehovah, and in their character of slaveholders, no less than in many other respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>According to <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> W., they enjoyed the <name>Divine</name> approbation in the practice of iniquity; for he says, the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> condemns both the <hi rend="italics">principle</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">practice</hi> of slavery!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>It is evident that the <name>Jews</name> brought slaves with them from <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; for the terms of the <name>Decalogue</name> not only imply that they were familiar with domestic slavery, but also that it was, at that time, an existing practice among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>But more than this, the <name>Decalogue</name> is strictly the constitution which Jehovah himself gave to the <name>Jewish</name> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Now to assume that he provided in this constitution to protect in all time to come (for it is allowed to embody immutable principles) a relation which was, in itself, <hi rend="italics">an iniquity</hi>, is more than a mere absurdity--<hi rend="italics">it is profanity</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>But whatever might be their original meaning, they are to be understood, as Bible terms, in the sense of the original <rs>Hebrew</rs>, which they are employed to express.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Now, nothing is more certain than this, that the <rs>Hebrew Bible</rs> (and the same is true of the <rs>English</rs> translation) speaks of <hi rend="italics">servants, hired</hi> servants, and <hi rend="italics">bond</hi> servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>The term servant is the generic form, and evidently means, a person who is controlled by the will of another: <hi rend="italics">hired</hi> servant is <num value="1">one</num> who serves in that way by contract for a definite period; whilst <hi rend="italics">bond</hi> servant is <num value="1">one</num> who has either contracted to do so through his whole life, or who, by the usages of war, or by inheritance, or by purchase from another, was so bound to service--(such as <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0062.0006.00142.00096" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> calls a <quote>servant under the yoke.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>If this be true, it is really passing strange that Jehovah himself should provide, in the organic law of the <name>Jewish</name> commonwealth, for the working of a system of domestic slavery, and, by a series of laws drawn up under this constitution, set such a system in <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>actual operation; and that the <name>Saviour</name> of mankind should also give, according to every legitimate interpretation that can be put, either upon his language or his conduct, his unqualified approbation to that which was so flatly opposed to all his doctrines!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>These, together with your text, young gentlemen, are leading authorities on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>Following these, we should adopt the belief that the principle of slavery in question is, as they express it, <quote>an absorption of the humanity of <num value="1">one</num> man into the will of another;</quote> or, in other words, that <quote>slavery contemplates him, not as a responsible, but a mere sentient being &mdash; not as a man, but a brute.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>If this be so, the wonder is not, as they affirm, that the civilized world is so indignant at its outrageous wrongs, but that <quote>it has been so slow in detecting its gross and palpable enormities: that mankind, for so many ages, acquiesced in a system as monstrously unnatural as would be a general effort to walk upon the head or to think with the feet!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>We need have no hesitation in flatly denying the truth of this description, and pronouncing it a caricature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>For if this be a faithful description, we can safely affirm that no instance of slavery ever existed under the authority of law in any nation known to history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>In the first place, the state of things so rhetorically described is a palpable impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>The constitution of the human mind is in flat contradiction to the idea of the absorption of the will, <pb id="p.148" n="148"/>the conscience, and the understanding of <num value="1">one</num> man into the personality of another!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>This is a state of things which the human mind cannot even conceive to be possible, but does intuitively perceive to be utterly impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>In the next place, we affirm that the idea of <hi rend="italics">personal rights</hi> and <hi rend="italics">personal responsibility</hi> pervades the whole system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Both the <name>Divine</name> and human laws which recognize the system, assume the personality and responsibility of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Even under the <rs>Roman</rs> and <rs>Grecian</rs> codes &mdash; which recognized far more stringent forms of slavery than that of the <name>African</name> in this country, at any period of its history &mdash; this view of the system will find no support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>For whilst they <hi rend="italics">recognize him as a servant</hi>, they treat him as a man: they declare him possessed, though a slave, of certain rights, which it was injustice in the master to disregard, and under obligation to certain duties, as a slave, which it would be sinful in him to neglect; and, moreover, that it was the office of that religion whose functions they filled, to protect these rights and duties with its most solemn sanctions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>Hence they enjoin upon masters the moral obligation of <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>rendering to their bondmen <quote><hi rend="italics">that which is just and equal</hi>,</quote> and upon servants to <quote><hi rend="italics">be subject to their masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>Let it be observed, that the conduct of individual slaveholders, in the exercise of any discretion conferred on them by the nature of their relation as masters, is still a separate question, and not here to be taken into the discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>We inquire as to the propriety of the institution: Is it demanded at all by the circumstances of the case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>This is eminently a practical question, and is the only <num value="1">one</num> which involves the morality of the <hi rend="italics">institution</hi> itself, now that the abstract principle is shown to be legitimate.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>The question now arises, Is this a suitable government for the negro race in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>Without doubt, this question is to be settled on the same general principles by which we should settle a similar question in regard to <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>the suitableness of any other form of government for any other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>For example, the same principles which determine the fitness of a military despotism, a constitutional monarchy, or a democratic republic, to any particular community of white persons, will determine the suitableness of this form of government to the <name>African</name> race in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>The claims of the <name>African</name> might be separately examined in regard to each of these forms of government; but this course is not demanded by the interests of this discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>Nor need we stop to inquire, how the <name>Africans</name> came into this country: whether lawfully or unlawfully &mdash; whether by their own act, or the act of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>These are in truth side issues, and do not necessarily attach to this discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>They will be treated as incidental to the main question; for although it were allowed that they are here unlawfully, and that it is our duty to remove them, yet it is still true that they are here, and cannot be immediately removed, and must therefore be subjected, as human beings, to <pb id="p.156" n="156"/>some <num value="1">one</num> of the known forms of civil government What form of government shall this be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>According to principles well established, and admitted on all sides, it should be such a form of government as, from its adaptation to their intellectual, moral, relative, and physical condition, is best calculated to promote their happiness and the happiness of those with whom they are necessarily associated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>But what form of government is it which will most probably accomplish this object?</p>

There is no reason to assume that to <pb id="p.158" n="158"/>place them in this condition would elevate them at once to such fitness as would make it a blessing, but there is every reason to <hi rend="italics">presume</hi> that the reverse would follow an elevation to political freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>If any think otherwise, the burden of proof lies upon him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>This presumption is greatly strengthened by the fact that they who claim political freedom for the <name>Africans</name> now in the country, have signally failed to secure it for those upon whom they have professed to confer it. Essential freedom is inseparably interlaced with <hi rend="italics">social equality</hi>. Without the latter, the former cannot possibly exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>The Northern States have long since conferred the forms of civil freedom upon the <name>African</name> portion of their population, but to the present hour they have denied them <hi rend="italics">social equally</hi>. Herein, they extinguish all the lights and comforts of essential freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>They settle upon them a suffocative anhelation, which is truly the most oppressive form of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>The social inequality of the races, it is well known, exists in a much more modified form at the <rs>South</rs> than at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>That those who have made, as we allow, an honest effort to confer essential freedom upon them, have signally failed, greatly strengthens the <hi rend="italics">presumption</hi> that we are right in believing that the end they proposed was impracticable, and <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>that we need not be so unwise as to imitate their folly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>But this <hi rend="italics">presumption</hi> is still further strengthened by the fact that the basis argument upon which the abolitionists usually rest the claims of the <name>African</name>, is entirely sophistical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>It is this: Slave property was originally acquired by robbery and violence, and therefore can never become lawful property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>Hence we should confer upon them political freedom, regardless of whatever consequences may follow; seeing that an act of robbery can never extinguish the original right of the person robbed, or confer original title upon the robber.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>The <hi rend="italics">doctrine</hi> assumed in this argument is, that possessions unjustly acquired originally, can never become legal possessions; or that a state of things originally resulting from <hi rend="italics">won</hi>, can never, by lapse of time, or the force of any circumstances, become right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>The <hi rend="italics">fact</hi> assumed as the basis of this doctrine in its application to the <name>African</name> is, that they were stolen while in a state of freedom, and reduced to a state of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>But we deny both the <hi rend="italics">doctrine</hi> and the hypothetical assumption on which it is based.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/><num value="1">1</num>. If the <hi rend="italics">doctrine</hi> be true, it will follow that all wrong is without any remedy, except in the few cases in which things may be restored to their original <pb id="p.160" n="160"/>state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>This would be a deplorable state of things indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>It would work special disaster to our Northern brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>For, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, if this doctrine be true, they own scarcely <num value="1">one</num> foot of honest land; nor is there any in the whole country, save the original purchase of <persName n="Penn,,William,,," id="n0062.0007.00160.00109" reg="default:Penn,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Penn</surname></persName>, and a few other unappreciable portions of territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> were the original and rightful owners of this whole country, according to the theory of rights which forms the basis of this doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>From the most of their possessions they were forcibly ejected at the peril of life as well as liberty; and from the remainder they were driven by a policy which in civilized life would be held and treated as knavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>These lands, according to this doctrine, should in all honesty be restored to their rightful owners, or to those who inherit them under their title, or the present holders are robbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>The <rs>Africans</rs>, it is said, were stolen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>If so, those who received them in this country can only be regarded as the receivers of stolen property &mdash; no better, if not worse, than the original thieves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>But on this hypothesis, Who stole them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>and who received this stolen property, knowing it to be so stolen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>These questions admit of but <num value="1">one</num> answer: The forefathers of the present generation of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> population!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>From their ports, vessels were fitted out, <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>and employed in this system of <quote>man-stealing.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>They became the receivers of this stolen property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Those who were not demanded by their own agricultural pursuits, were sold in Southern markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>As the climate and soil of the <rs>South</rs> were better suited to such labor, the larger portion of all this stolen property was accumulated in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>The product of the lands of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and the product of these sales of stolen Africans, have been, from time to time, invested in commercial and manufacturing pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>These constitute the chief sources of the great wealth of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States, to the present day; and these, it is well known, are mainly supported by the products of slave labor at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>This being so, the great wealth of the <rs>Northern States</rs> can be regarded only as so much dishonest gain!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>Really, it is time they were looking to the duty of restitution!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>But the disaster of this doctrine does not exhaust itself with our Northern brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>The Norman Conquest of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is that by which all the land-titles of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> are held to the present day. All these titles are held under the rights acquired by this conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>Now it is well known that the <rs>Norman Conquest</rs> was the most lawless piece of injustice and butchery, the record of which ever disgraced the pages of human history!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>Upon the basis of the doctrine in question, it is equally certain <pb id="p.162" n="162"/>that there is scarcely an honest shilling in all <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>Nor is this all: the present titles of all <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, <placeName reg="Asia" key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Africa</placeName>, are traceable, more or less remotely, to a source equally cruel and unjust!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Thus there is an end pretty much to all honesty, as to the possessions of the civilized world!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>Surely, the absurdity of this conclusion is sufficient to invalidate the soundness of the doctrine from which it arises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>Now we are far from affirming that <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>--which is the negative of <hi rend="italics">right</hi>--can ever become, by circumstances or any thing else, otherwise than it is, that is, <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, namely, not <hi rend="italics">right</hi>. But the <hi rend="italics">state</hi> or <hi rend="italics">thing</hi> which, under <num value="1">one</num> set of circumstances, is <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi> may, under other circumstances, become <hi rend="italics">right</hi>. It is not the <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi> in itself which, in such a case, changes to right; but, by a change of circumstances, the <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi> no longer inheres, but the right inheres in that which formerly involved the wrong; and therefore the state or thing which was before wrong, now becomes <hi rend="italics">right</hi>. Hence, although it be admitted that the land-titles of the civilized world were originally founded in <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi>, and therefore were unjust titles, it may not follow that those who now hold them, do so by an unjust title, because the original title was unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>The facts may be thus stated in regard to the most of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>The titles were originally acquired by <pb id="p.163" n="163"/><hi rend="italics">wrong;</hi> in many instances, <hi rend="italics">cruel wrong</hi>! The authors of these wrongs were usually the heads of government, who, in their circumstances, were beyond control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/><hi rend="italics">They</hi> did the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>The ultimate results of their doings, by the lapse of time with its perpetual changes, upset all the existing relations of society, merged the descendants of the actors and sufferers in these wrongs into the mass of society, beyond the power of just discrimination, and introduced an altogether new state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>Under these circumstances, the original wrong was ultimately placed beyond all remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>The restoration of the lands to the original and lawful owners became an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>To attempt such a work could only be followed by the grossest injustice to all the parties concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>In this state of things, the question of title &mdash; Who shall own these lands?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>becomes an original question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>And in this state of the case, the simple fact of present <hi rend="italics">possession</hi>--there being no <num value="1">one</num> to claim antecedent possession &mdash; according to the fundamental belief of all mankind, confers moral title, and should therefore be made legal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>Hence the title is just, because the idea of the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> in itself &mdash; that which is good &mdash; now inheres in the man who holds property under such circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>The argument authorizes this prescriptive principle in political science: <hi rend="italics">That when the original</hi> <pb id="p.164" n="164"/><hi rend="italics">wrong cannot be remedied, without inflicting greater injury</hi>, on all the parties concerned, <hi rend="italics">than to permit the existing state of things to remain, in this state of the case, the existing state of things is in itself</hi> right, <hi rend="italics">and should be permitted to remain</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>Upon the basis of this principle &mdash; without which, we have no scruple to say, society could nowhere harmonize for a single hour &mdash; we have no difficulty in vindicating the honesty of the descendants of the <name>Puritans</name>, or the land-titles of the civilized world, or the <num value="1000">thousand</num> other titles which are equally involved by the absurd doctrine under consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>Nor do we find any difficulty in allowing them a just title to all the proceeds of the <name>African</name> traffic, even though it should be conceded that their forefathers were, as they characterize them, a set of mere <hi rend="italics">men-stealers</hi>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>Having invalidated this doctrine as a piece of gross sophistry, we remark:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/><num value="2">2</num>. That we also deny the hypothesis upon the basis of which this false doctrine has been made to apply to the <name>Africans</name> of this country; that is, we deny that <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery in this country had its origin or was founded in cruelty and robbery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>There is no reason to doubt the statements of history, that many slave-ships originally (as perhaps is still the case to some extent) acquired <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>their cargoes, some by robbery and violence, and some by purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>The sufferings of what is called the <quote>middle passage</quote> are, no doubt, correctly stated in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>We have no motive to controvert these statements, nor indeed to inquire into their authenticity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>We are not even the apologists of any of the actors in these scenes, much less their defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>There may have been cruel wrongs, and under circumstances of even greater aggravation than those recorded in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>Be it so!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>The actors have long since gone to their account, and we may safely leave them to Him who judgeth righteously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>The conduct of these agents, whether cruel or kind, is not an element in this discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>Our inquiry goes to the foundation of this matter &mdash; the true producing cause for the introduction of the <name>African</name> into this country, and his position as a salve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>What was this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>It will not be maintained that these agents, whether humane or not, can in any proper sense be said to be the cause or foundation of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>With much greater propriety it may be said that the artisans of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> were the founders and builders of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>They were necessary agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>They might have done their part well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>They might have done it dishonestly, cruelly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>Neither hypothesis will entitle them to rank as the true and proper founders <pb id="p.166" n="166"/>and builders of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>So neither are the men in question to be regarded as the founders and builders of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>Whether they did their part as they should have done, or should not have done; or whether <hi rend="italics">they</hi> did the work at all, or not, is the mere logical accident of <hi rend="italics">a cause</hi>, which lay back of all they did, and of all they might have done, whether good or bad. This cause is evolved by the inquiry, Why did they bring them into the country at all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>If some potent <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> had not been at work, would they or any others have brought them into the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>Certainly not. This <hi rend="italics">cause</hi>, then, whatever it was, is without doubt the true foundation, the immediate cause, of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>What, then, was this cause?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>But <num value="1">one</num> answer can be given to this inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>On it there can be no division of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>It was the state of public opinion in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and the state of public opinion in her colonies in this country at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>This state of public opinion demanded their introduction and employment as slaves, and hence they were introduced and so employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>Whatever demerit or merit, then, was in the origin and maturity of this state of things, is traceable directly to public opinion, and attaches directly as a virtue or a crime, as the case may be, to those who controlled public opinion, through the <pb id="p.167" n="167"/>long period of its inception, formation, and maturity, and to them alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>This being the true origin and foundation of the system, if it had its foundation in <hi rend="italics">robbery</hi> and <hi rend="italics">violence</hi>, it was because public opinion, through that long period, was so eminently corrupt as to set itself, deliberately and of full purpose, to work to perpetrate <hi rend="italics">robbery</hi> and <hi rend="italics">violence</hi>, without any redeeming virtue; for such crimes admit of none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>Was this so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>Can we be prepared to believe it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>In default of all history at this point to detail the origin and progress of public opinion on this subject, we are left to form our judgment from our knowledge of the men whom we know to have participated more largely than any others in directing public opinion in their day, and to the history of the times in which they lived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>In the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century, <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slaves were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduced into this country, and the practice was continued, under the sanction of law, until the years <dateStruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>, inclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>At an early period, public opinion was matured on this subject both in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and in the colonies, and we see that for a long period it sustained the practice of introducing slaves directly from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> into this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>Now, we affirm that the position postulated in regard to this case is among the most palpable absurdities that can be conceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/><pb id="p.168" n="168"/>The character of the men who controlled public opinion in that day, and the patriotic and <name>Christian</name> age in which they lived, utterly disprove the gross assumption that they yielded themselves up to falsify the truth and the conscience that was in them, and become a mere corporation of land-pirates and freebooters!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>If our ignorance of the history of those times should disqualify us to account for the existence of this state of public opinion on any strictly rational grounds, common sense would forbid that we assign for it so unreasonable a cause as this; whilst the least that charity could suggest would be, that we place it among those things for which we were unable to account.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>These great men, and some of them eminently good men, stood connected with a numerous class of highly influential men, though inferior in position, and all together may be regarded as embodying and controlling public opinion in their day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>Still we have abundant materials for a charitable construction of the conduct of our forefathers &mdash; both here and in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>The savage, and indeed the brutal condition of the larger portion of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, had long since been a matter of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>All well-informed men were familiar with the facts of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>They were not only Pagans, but Pagans of the most stupid and enslaved kind &mdash; without the knowledge of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, or the rudest forms of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>The population <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>was divided into tribes, each governed by an ignorant petty king, who ruled his equally Pagan subjects as absolute slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>In the place of the knowledge and worship of the. true <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, which was found to exist among the savages of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, the <name>African</name> worships the devil &mdash; the evil spirit, and that by the most humiliating and debasing rites of superstition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>His superstitions furnished frequent occasions for wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>These wars were highly sanguinary &mdash; often exterminating, as all wars amongst an ignorant and highly superstitious people have always been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>To spare the life of an enemy in war, make him a prisoner, guard him as such, or make him labor as a slave for his support, is an a vance of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>To continue to put the enemy to death to the end of the war, is the necessary condition of a state of war in uncivilized life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>Such was the known condition of all the <name>African</name> population south of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and the <name>States</name> of <persName n="Barbary,,,,," id="n0062.0007.00171.00130" reg="mostcommon:Barbary,nomatch:0"><surname>Barbary</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>Did not their condition appeal, as it still does, to the benevolence of the civilized world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>But what could they do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>Send <name>Christian</name> missionaries?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>No. We, in this country, have succeeded,<num value="7">7</num> to some extent at least, in civilizing the savage tribes upon our border!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>But the <name>Indians</name> were not, like the <name>Africans</name>, idolatrous Pagans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>Be this as it may, the competency of missionary enterprise to civilize and <pb id="p.172" n="172"/>christianize Pagans, was, as it still is to any very material, extent, an untried experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>The opinion then obtained, and to this hour it is not wholly invalidated, that to reduce Pagans to a state of labor was, among other agencies, a necessary condition of their civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>What then could Christians do in that age for <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> civilization?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>They could not introduce them as laborers in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, or on the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>Such a step would have denied bread to the multitudes who already filled the menial offices of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>It was impracticable to do this, and inhuman to attempt it. Thus for long ages had degraded and enslaved <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> <quote>stretched forth</quote> her imploring hands, appealing to the benevolence of the world for relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>But the wisest and best men of the times saw no means of relief, and attempted none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>In this state of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> history, colonial settlements were ultimately effected on the coast of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>At an early period an experiment was made by a Dutch Manhattan, to introduce <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> labor into the colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>Here a wide field was open for their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>It was greatly demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>To labor here denied bread to no other laboring poor, as would have been the case in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>The idea was caught at in both hemispheres, as a <quote><hi rend="italics"><name n="God" type="God">God</name>-send</hi></quote> for the <name>African</name> &mdash; for the colonies, and a common civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>No <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>dreamed of robbery, injustice, or wrong to any <num value="1">one</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>All considered it a wide door which a kind <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> had opened, and which piety itself bade them enter!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>No man who was worthy of the age authorized any <num value="1">one</num> to fit out a ship, from the port of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> or elsewhere, go to the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, steal a cargo of natives, murder all who stood in the way of his schemes, tumble them into the hold of their ship, without regard to health or comfort, and make their way with their piratical cargo to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and other markets, and turn them into money!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>Those who did this &mdash; as many no doubt did &mdash; acted on their own responsibility, and have long since given their dreadful account to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>But the men who were worthy of the age, and who would be worthy of any age, did authorize, by a common public opinion, the practice of going to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, and negotiating a purchase with those who had long held and treated them as slaves, and especially those who by the usages of barbarous war were condemned to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>They considered that thus to arrest the practice of putting prisoners to death was humane, and worthy of a Christian people; that to introduce them into civilized society, teach them the habits of civilized life, the principles and experience of Christianity, and ultimately perhaps to send them back to regenerate their fatherland, was an achievement <pb id="p.174" n="174"/>worthy of the highest attainments of piety!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>Hence they had no scruple to purchase them when brought to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>The most eminently patriotic and benevolent of the colonists purchased them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>The most pious members of churches, and distinguished <name>Christian</name> ministers, did the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>The immortal <rs>Whitefield</rs> did not scruple to sustain his pious foundation in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> by a large income, for the times, from slave property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>Were they correct in these views?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>We appeal to facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>Multitudes were brought to the country who had otherwise perished in barbarous warfare, or been murdered as captives, and the others would have remained in a state of Pagan ignorance, superstition, and slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>By coming into the country, they have been greatly improved in their mental, moral, and physical condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>I do not stay to trouble you with statistical details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>But nm investigations warrant a statement, which you can test at your leisure; it is this: the number of Africans who have died in the communion of the <rs>Methodist</rs> and <rs>Baptist</rs> churches of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> to the present time &mdash; and who, therefore, we may assume, were christianized by their residence in this country &mdash; exceeds the whole number of all the heathen who have been christianized by the labors of all the <name>Protestant</name> denominations of Christendom since the days of <persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>Hence, <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>we conclude, that whatever were the cruelties of individuals engaged in the original slave trade, (for which they were responsible,) and whatever may have been the abuses of the system since, by individual slave owners, the system itself was originally founded in a profound view of the principles of political science, so far as regards this country, and of political economy, and the claims of <name>Christian</name> benevolence so far as it regards the <name>Africans</name> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>The resources of this vast country have been rapidly developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>It is already the asylum of the oppressed, and the home of the poor, of all lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>Slave labor has had no small share in all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>The regeneration of the continent of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> has already commenced, and the ultimate result is looked to with increasing confidence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>Thus we have invalidated the <hi rend="italics">doctrine</hi>, and also the hypothesis, which form the basis on which the abolitionists rest their argument against the justice and policy of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>That their position is not tenable is no direct proof that ours is right; but it does afford a <hi rend="italics">presumption</hi> that we are right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>This <hi rend="italics">presumption</hi> we claim, for the several reasons given.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>it having been proved that both the doctrine and the assumption of fact by Northern fanatics, in regard to the claim of the <name>African</name> to a republican form of government, are false, and that the presumption is in favor of the position of the <rs>South</rs>, that domestic slavery is the appropriate form of government for them, we are now left free to pursue our inquiry, without offset from <pb id="p.177" n="177"/>these vagaries, into the merits of this system, and its appropriateness to the <name>African</name> race in this country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>The <rs>African</rs> is now here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>Whether right or wrong originally, is not the question before us. He is here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>What form of government is best suited to him, and those with whom he is necessarily associated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>And,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>I. Let it be observed, that they are a distinct race of people, separated by strongly marked lines of moral and physical condition from those amongst whom they reside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>This difference is so strongly marked that there can be no spontaneous amalgamation by intermarriage, and consequently no reciprocity of social rights and privileges between the races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>Their history in the whole country shows this to be the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>They must therefore continue to exist as a separate race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>To this state of things the government over them should be adapted, unless we would violate a material condition of the problem to be solved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>For if the law should not provide for this state of the case, the conventional usages of the superior race amongst whom they dwell will certainly do so. This is in proof from the example of all those States which have failed to provide for the <name>African</name> as a separate and distinct race; for the usages of society always supply the deficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/><pb id="p.178" n="178"/>This omission on the part of the law is evidently to the injury of the <name>African</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>The history of the race in the <rs>Northern States</rs> will show this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>Essential liberty is founded in, and is inseparable from, certain social rights and privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>But in these respects, the <name>African</name> is a far more proscribed and degraded race in the <rs>Northern</rs> than in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>A government, then, should be provided for the <name>African</name>, as a distinct and separate race, existing in the bosom of another and superior race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>Of course this will be an <hi rend="italics">imperium in imperio</hi>. And as they are confessedly the inferior race, who can never enjoy essential liberty or reciprocity of social condition with the whites, the government adapted to them must be inferior and subordinate to that of the whites amongst whom they dwell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>It must be subordinate; for, in the nature of things, it must be an independent or a subordinate <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>But <num value="2">two</num> independent civil governments cannot coexist, and control distinct races dwelling together in the same community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>It follows that it must be subordinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>As subordinate, it must either assume some form of military government, or it must conform to the patriarchal species of government &mdash; a kind of family government &mdash; that is, the domestic form for which we contend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>And as between a subordinate <pb id="p.179" n="179"/>military or patriarchal form of government, both as regards the expense and the comfort, there can be no controversy, we may consider the claims of the patriarchal form, or the system of domestic slavery, as established in this case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>But it may be supposed that the experiment in the <rs>Northern States</rs> invalidates the position, that this, being a distinct race of people, must be controlled by a separate and subordinate form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>These States have a portion of this race, and it is said they find no difficulty to result from having placed them on a political footing with other citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>But this is a mere assumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>It is not borne out by the facts of history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>As before stated, the conventional usages of society have denied them the social rights and privileges of free citizens!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>They have proscribed then as an inferior and degraded race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>The usage which forbids intermarriage is at once a bar to all social equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>The road to offices of trust, honor, and profit, is closed against them &mdash; nay, even the means of subsistence beyond a scanty supply of the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>These facts are undeniable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>Now, to talk of liberty when we effectually deny to a people all that essentially constitutes it, is idle in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>It is a mere paper liberty!--liberty to submit to the crushing usages of society!--liberty to <pb id="p.180" n="180"/>perish, in many instances, and that without sympathy from the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>In these respects the condition of the race is unquestionably better in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>If they must be a degraded race in the <rs>North</rs> as well as in the <rs>South</rs>, I hesitate not to affirm that our domestic system affords them a much better security for a competent and comfortable living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>It makes better provision for them in old age and in youth, in sickness and in health, than is secured to them by their so-called liberty in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>Of course, poor families (in the literal sense) in the <rs>South</rs> do not own slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>They are usually held by those who at least enjoy the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>Now, the progress of civilization has established the custom in all such families of sharing with their slaves the necessaries, and, not unfrequently, many of the comforts of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>The exceptions only make the rule general.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>Again, the <rs>Southern</rs> system, by making the <name>African</name> a part of the family circle, brings him into more immediate contact with the habits of civilized life, and cultivates a high degree of sympathy between him and his owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>Hence, the well-known attachment of slaves to the families in which they were brought up; and their utter repugnance to being hired to a Northern family, whatever may be their reputation for piety <pb id="p.181" n="181"/>They are without practical sympathy for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>They often subject them to a degree of hard labor to which they are not accustomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>Many humane men in the <rs>South</rs> decline hiring their servants to such persons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>There are evils, it is true, inseparable from the presence of the race in this country, under any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>By conferring on them a mere paper liberty, the <rs>Northern States</rs> have adroitly freed themselves of a portion of these evils; but then they have evidently accumulated them upon the <name>African</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>The policy is marked by no sympathy for the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>There is much more of selfishness than of benevolence in the working of the system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>We conclude that our position is true, that the <name>Africans</name>, being a separate and distinct race of people, who cannot spontaneously amalgamate with the whites, should be placed under a separate and subordinate form of government, if we consult either their welfare or our own. The examples referred to, as proof of the contrary, are strongly confirmatory of the position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>But to claim for the <name>African</name> political equality with the whites is subject to still stronger objections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>We may further appeal to facts in support of our proposition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/><num value="2">II</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>They are not, in point of intellectual and moral development, in the condition for freedom: <pb id="p.182" n="182"/>that is, they are not fitted for that measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>of self-government which is necessary to political sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>It cannot, therefore, be justly claimed for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>They have no right to it. It would not be to them an essential good, but an essential evil, a curse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>To confer it on them, either by an act of direct or gradual emancipation, would be eminently productive of injury to the whole country, and utterly ruinous to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>This proposition is capable of division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>We will discuss the points in the order in which they stand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>They are not, in point of intellectual and moral development, fitted for that measure of self-government which is necessary to political sovereignty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>We have said they are an inferior race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>That they are so in the original structure of their minds I pretend not to affirm &mdash; nay, I do not believe it. I believe in the unity of the races &mdash; that <hi rend="italics"><name n="God" type="God">God</name></hi> <quote><hi rend="italics">hath made of <num value="1">one</num> blood all nations of men</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>Acts <num value="17">XVII</num>. <num value="26">26</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>But that the race in this country are inferior, in the general development of their intellectual and moral faculties, I am free to affirm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>This I attribute to the crushing influence of the ages of barbarous and pagan life to which their forefathers in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> were subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>For, as, in the progress of civilization, each succeeding generation <pb id="p.183" n="183"/>of civilized persons occupies a higher intellectual and moral platform, so, in the descending scale of barbarism, each succeeding generation of barbarians occupies a lower platform of intellectual and moral development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>Hence, we can account for the exceedingly barbarous condition of the race when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought into this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>It also follows, that a race of men whose intellects have been long stultified by ages of barbarism, cannot, by any contact with the principles and usages of civilized life, be speedily thrown up to an elevated platform.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>This also accounts, in a good degree, for the slow progress which the race has made in civilization, since their introduction into the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>To recur now to the fact, which cannot be controverted, that they were brought into this country in a state of extreme barbarism and Pagan ignorance: in the first place, were they then in a condition which fitted them for political sovereignty, and equality of social rights and privileges with the whites?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>If they were not for the latter, it is very plain that they were not for the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>It is quite certain that they were not prepared for either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>If they were, why did not the <name>Puritans</name> of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> allow them this sovereignty and equality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>By their consent and active cooperation, they were brought into the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>Shall <pb id="p.184" n="184"/>we revilingly say, with some of their ungrateful descendants, that the good sense and love of liberty which had so lately driven them from their fatherland, to find an asylum here from the galling yoke of <name>British</name> oppression, had been so entirely absorbed in the passion for gain, as to cause them to be deaf to the claims of justice and humanity in behalf of the <name>African</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>Shame on their graceless accusers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>No: their good sense forbade that a race of barbarous Pagans, who could not be absorbed by intermarriage, but who must continue to exist amongst them as a separate and inferior race, should be placed on a common platform with free citizens!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>Their humanity, no less than their good sense, induced them to adopt the plan of domestic government, or slavery, sanctioned by the usages of all civilized nations in similar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>If, for any cause, a horde of barbarians should be introduced into <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> in the present day, in numbers too great to be absorbed without injury, and in a physical condition making it improper to permit their absorption by intermarriage with themselves, as in the case of the <name>Africans</name>, does any man in his senses pretend to believe that those States would confer on them either social equality or political freedom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>They would certainly consider it due to them-selves, no less than to the barbarians, to place <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>them under a subordinate government of some kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>Well, this is precisely what their forefathers did in the case of the <rs>Pagan Africans</rs>; and what the <rs>Southern</rs> colonies did when the New Englanders brought them South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>Thus the origin of domestic slavery, as a political institution, in the country, shows that it was founded in the humanity of our forefathers, no less than in their good sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>Hence the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> position stated: Political equality cannot be justly claimed for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>They have no right to it. To them it would not be an essential good, but an essential evil &mdash; a curse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>On the basis of the doctrine of rights discussed in a preceding lecture, this proposition follows as a conclusion from the fact here established in regard to the <name>Africans</name> of this country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>But it may be said that the barbarous character of the race has greatly improved since their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduction into this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>This is true &mdash; eminently so. And standing, as this fact evidently does, connected with the civilization and redemption of a whole continent of barbarians, upon whom the crushing sceptre of Pagan ignorance has lain for unnumbered ages, it fully vindicates both the wisdom and benevolence of the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, which permitted their introduction in such vast numbers into civilized life, as affording the only means of accomplishing his humane design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/><pb id="p.186" n="186"/></p> 
<p>But the question of practical interest at this point is, Have they been so far raised in the scale of intellectual and moral elevation as to acquire for them the right in question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>This point can be settled only by an appeal to facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>I hesitate not to allow, that if they are, it may be justly claimed for them, because they are in that moral condition which justly entities them to it. It is also admitted that if at the same time, they are in a condition to be absorbed by a spontaneous amalgamation, they are entitled to it here; and much more so than a certain other class, who are flocking into the country, and to whom the right is accorded without scruple!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>This latter, however, is certainly not the case, as the facts before alluded to do clearly show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>If, then, they be entitled to political freedom, they should be removed to another territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/><placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> is the rightful home of the <name>Africans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>Thither they must go, if they should ever be fitted for self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has wisely forecast this result, and is rapidly building up a free government on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, as their future home, and the centre of civilization and Christianity to that long-be-nighted continent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>But what of the question-Are they indeed fitted for political sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>That many of the free colored population, and some among the <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>slaves, may be so, I think is more than probably true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>Of the former I would say, that it is a duty they owe themselves no less than the country to accept the offer of the <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName>, and remove to their native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>For, although it be allowed that they are in the moral condition of freedom, it is obvious that they never can be essentially free, in the bosom of a people with whom they can never amalgamate by marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>And in regard to the latter, I have to say that such of their owners as give that play to their benevolent feelings which their circumstances admit, and, as far as they can do so with propriety, facilitate their removal to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> by consent, entitle themselves to high commendation, and it is usually awarded them with great unanimity by Southern people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>But that the same admissions can be made in regard to the masses of this population in the country, I utterly deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>On the contrary, I affirm that duty to ourselves and humanity to them alike forbid that civil liberty be conferred on them in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, or elsewhere, and least of all in this country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>The assumption of Northern agitators, that the <rs>Southern</rs> people are not competent judges in this matter, because they are too much interested in their bondage, is as untrue in fact as it is offensive <pb id="p.188" n="188"/>to our good sense and morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>No doubt there are many in the <rs>South</rs> capable of any form of wickedness; nor need it be denied that we are as liable to be misled in our judgments as other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>But it is equally true, that the good sense and integrity of the great mass of our population is a full counterbalance to the acknowledged cupidity of the few. And for a set of Northern agitators, who never resided at the <rs>South</rs>, and who know but little or nothing of the <name>African</name> character, to affect to understand it better than the intelligent communities of the <rs>South</rs>, is perhaps the coolest piece of impertinent self-conceit to be found on record!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>The intelligent and honest portion of the country will scarcely fail to allow that the judgment of the <rs>Southern</rs> people as to the character and capabilities of the <name>African</name> is entitled to the highest confidence, and may be regarded as an authoritative settlement of this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>What, then, is the concurrent opinion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>I think myself well and fully informed on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>I hazard nothing in asserting, that it is the general and well-nigh the universal opinion of the intelligent and pious portion of our entire population, that our <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> subjects, taken as a whole, are not fitted for any form of political freedom of which we can conceive; that they are not in a condition to use it to their own advantage, or <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>the peace of the communities in which they reside; and that to confer it upon them, in these circumstances, would in all probability lead to the extirpation of the race, as the only means of protecting civilization from the insufferable evils of so direct a contact with an unrestrained barbarism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>It is also an opinion equally sanctioned, that if they were prepared for political freedom, it would be scarcely less disastrous to confer it upon them in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>The reason is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>As they cannot spontaneously amalgamate with the whites, they could not, in the nature of things, enjoy freedom in their midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>Hence, if the masses should ever reach that point, in the progress of civilization, at which it might be proper to confer on them the rights of political freedom, another location would have to be sought for them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>The Southern people (using the term in the sense specified) constitute a large portion of the whole Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>They have progressed as far in civilization, and, in many respects, much farther than any people in the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>A very large portion of them are confessedly pious, as well as intelligent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Taken as a whole, they are as eminently entitled to be regarded a religious people as any other people on the face of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>Now, that such a people, so obviously entitled to the highest consideration throughout <pb id="p.190" n="190"/>the civilized world, should, in their circumstances of proximity to the <name>African</name> race, and long-continued personal acquaintance with their habits and character, their capabilities and their liabilities, be of the settled and almost undisputed opinion that they are not competent to self-government; and that, in their present circumstances, both the law of reciprocity and the law of benevolence to the <name>African</name> forbid that the rights of political freedom be accorded to them, does appear to me to afford the most conclusive settlement of this question of fact that the subject is capable of receiving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>For, although a question of fact, it is capable of no more conclusive settlement than an enlightened public opinion can afford; and who are so well situated to form an opinion as the free and intelligent communities of the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>and who can be more honest in its expression?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>As we cannot suppose the agitators of the country on this subject to be ignorant of the fact that such is the opinion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and as we cannot allow that they are incapable of appreciating the weight of this testimony, we reach the conclusion that they are the victims of a fanaticism resulting from a mistaken religious opinion and feeling, which hurries them madly forward, as regardless of the extent to which they implicate their own good sense as they are of the <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>extent to which they are aspersing the reputation of their fellow-citizens, or the degree to which they are actually putting to hazard the lives of the very people for whom they piously persuade themselves they are laboring.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>Those whose conduct does not admit of this apology are generally men who occupy the arena of political agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>Their object, evidently, is to accumulate political power in the so-called free States, and to promote the ends of personal ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>The fanatical excitement of the country may be turned to the account of these objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>Hence, they labor with a zeal worthy of a better cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>We of the <rs>South</rs> regard the agitators in Congress, for the most part, to be of this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>We consider them highly culpable, if, indeed, they be not actually criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>For we cannot suppose them to be ignorant of the facts and reasonings here adduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>And besides these, there are other facts of great and conclusive authority in the settlement of this question, which we cannot suppose have escaped the attention of men occupying their high stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>I propose to notice some of them in the next lecture. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>This is the general proposition still under consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>I now proceed to exemplify the truth of the positions discussed on this general proposition, and thereby show the actual necessity that we sustain, in the present circumstances of the race, the system of domestic slavery.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>We adduce the fact of domestic colonization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>This has been frequently attempted in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and has as often failed for the want of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>Eminently humane, though mistaken men, have tried this experiment with their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Some have tried it on a small scale: standing only as their nominal owners, and giving them the control of their time and labor, and the use of necessary lands for cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>Others have tried the same plan on a more extended scale of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>But if there is a single successful experiment now in operation in the <rs>Southern</rs> country, I am not aware of it. In every instance the owners have been compelled to resume the control of their slaves, to prevent them from becoming a tax on the community, and a nuisance in the neighborhood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>The result of the experiment in the case of the free colored population, is equally in <pb id="p.194" n="194"/>proof that the race, taken collectively, is not fitted for self-government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>Humane individuals have, from time to time, freed their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>In this way a large number has been accumulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>There is not a county in any <num value="1">one</num> of the older States in which there are not many, and in some a large number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>In this experiment we have a full test of what the <name>African</name> is in the enjoyment of civil liberty, or of his capacity for self-government, at least in the midst of a people with whom he cannot amalgamate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>The result is daily before our eyes, and may be known and read of all men. After a few honorable exceptions, the multitude are by no means as well fed or clothed, and otherwise provided for, as the slaves in their vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>They make but little provision against the inclemency of winter, and in sickness are often the objects of public charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>A disposition to live by petty depredations upon society, instead of by honest industry, and a general depravation of morals, are characteristic of the caste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>Their retrograde tendency is so obvious, that no doubt is entertained among men of reflection that, but for the props and checks thrown around them by the laws and usages of civilization, they would soon relapse into the savage state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>These facts are so obvious as long since to have engaged the attention of our domestics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/><pb id="p.195" n="195"/>Among them, the term <quote>free nigger</quote> is <num value="1">one</num> of deepest reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>Those who respect themselves, it is well known, form no matrimonial alliance with them, from sheer contempt of their degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>I have frequently met, in my travels, with old men, in independent circumstances, who by the doctrines of the pulpit, enforced by the personal influence of a favorite minister in private life, were induced, in early life, to free their slaves, who now confess, with the result of their mistaken piety before their eyes, that they conferred no boon upon them, but rather inflicted an injury both upon them and upon society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>They console themselves with the reflection that they intended all for the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>This picture is not surcharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>You will do me the justice to remember that no dark picture can be drawn without dipping the pencil in dark colors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>I have an interest in a slave, who is no doubt in the moral condition of freedom, as before defined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>I have assured this man that he ought to go to <placeName reg="Liberia,Africa" key="tgn,1000171">Liberia, in Africa</placeName>, and have insisted on his consenting to go. But still I am so deeply convinced of the truth and importance of the facts here stated in regard to our free colored population, that a sense of duty to him and to the community forbid that he be placed among the number.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>But it may be supposed that a popular feeling <pb id="p.196" n="196"/>of selfish hostility serves to crush a people who would otherwise rise at once in the scale of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>But this is not so. I repeat, with confidence, this is not so. The honorable exceptions, to which allusion has already been made, are universally respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/><quote><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName></quote> (to use a general title) <quote>is as honest a man, and has as much self-respect, as any man in the neighborhood,</quote> is a meed of praise which is readily accorded to free blacks, by all intelligent citizens,. and with peculiar satisfaction, whenever it can be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>Such men of course enjoy the confidence and respect of their white neighbors in a high degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>But, I repeat, that examples of this kind are rare among our free colored population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>No! an original cause of this general degradation is found in the fact stated, that is, that they are not prepared for self-government, and therefore can derive but little, if any, benefit from its political and social advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>The crushing weight of ages of barbarism still presses heavily upon the intellect of the <name>African</name>, and in his present circumstances, to say the least, he is too feeble to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>It is the accident of his position that he is free, and not the law of his intellectual and moral nature that makes him so. He is a slave in fact; and without the restraints of the domestic system, the tendencies of his barbarous nature are left, in a good degree, to take their <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>downward way. In many counties within our knowledge containing a large population of free colored persons, I am satisfied that nothing but the humanity developed by a high state of civilization, prevents the adoption of a summary process, by which the nuisance would be abated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>But if the objection I am combating be modified and restricted to the influence of that usage which denies them social freedom, I will agree that it has weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>It certainly retards the progress of those who are rising to the moral condition of freedom: hangs like an incubus upon those who have already risen to that state, and effectually shuts the door of enjoyment against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>This is no doubt true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>But why are they denied social freedom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>The answer is, Because they cannot amalgamate by a spontaneous intermarriage with the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>But this is a disability under which <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, by the nature of their physical constitution, has placed them, and which the progress of civilization itself forbids the whites to disregard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>Therefore it is obvious that they never can be free in a community of whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>Because, as there is no essential freedom, but that which is inseparable from social as well as political freedom, and as there can be no social freedom, but that which coincides with the law of amalgamation by intermarriage; and as <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> has closed is <pb id="p.198" n="198"/>the door against this, it follows that the <name>African</name> never can be free in the midst of a community of whites.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>But still, that this is not the primary and essential cause of the extreme degradation of those Africans upon whom the experiment of freedom has been tried in this country and found to be a failure, and that it is originally traceable to the fact that they are not, intellectually and morally, prepared for self-government, is still more clearly deducible from a</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>Thither all eyes are turned as the oasis of hope in her desert history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>But let us briefly trace the progress of this hopeful colony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>How has it arisen to its present position?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>It has been built up from the free colored population of this country &mdash; colonized by their own consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>Herein <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> has <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>wisely discriminated the proper subjects for this great enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>His own established order of things has effected a judicious discrimination of the proper persons for this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>The sacrifices to be made were great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>The climate was inhospitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>Extreme hazard of life, in all cases, was to be encountered in the process of acclimation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>A Pagan and savage population were to be encountered and subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>Every thing gave undoubted indications, that if ever the tree of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> liberty should be made to flourish upon that Pagan coast, its roots must be watered by the blood of many patriot martyrs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>In these circumstances, it is obvious that there would be no volunteers in this work but men of the right stamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>Those only whose intellects furnished the flint and steel from which the spark of liberty could be struck, and upon the altar of whose hearts the fires of freedom could be kindled, to light their pathway to that far-off and inhospitable land, would embark in this great work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>Those who were in the condition of freedom &mdash; whose hearts throbbed with the pulsations of liberty &mdash; were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to embark in the cause of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>For several years the work went on &mdash; slowly, but surely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>Many fell in the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>Still the work went on!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>The spirit which animated the patriot colonists is eloquently expressed in the dying words of the <pb id="p.200" n="200"/>immortal <persName n="Cox,,,,," id="n0062.0009.00200.00131" reg="mostcommon:Cox,nomatch:0"><surname>Cox</surname></persName>: <quote>Let a <num value="1000">thousand</num> missionaries fall, ere <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> be given up!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>Thus far the work went on in the order of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>The voluntary principle was discriminating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>Those who were in the moral condition of freedom gladly embraced the opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>Those who were below that condition were deaf to the call.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>It is a general, and indeed an almost universal Opinion in the <rs>South</rs>, that any thing like a system of emancipation, whether direct or gradual, by which the number of free colored persons should be materially increased in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, would inevitably be followed by their indiscriminate <hi rend="italics">massacre</hi>, as the only means <hi rend="italics">of</hi> abating an insufferable nuisance, unless the citizens were to forsake the soil in favor of a barbarous horde.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>Such an opinion, (I may repeat,) so generally entertained by so large a community of enlightened and virtuous citizens, who are in immediate proximity with the race, and acquainted with their character from early life, taken in connection with the historical facts here enumerated, affording to any mind so clear a proof of the correctness of <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>their opinion, should be admitted as an authoritative settlement of the position I have taken on this branch of the subject.

<p>On the general question, Is the system of domestic government existing amongst us, and involving the abstract principle of slavery, justified by the circumstances of the case, and therefore right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>we reach an affirmative conclusion, for the reasons:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>I. That the <name>Africans</name> are a distinct race of people, who cannot amalgamate to any material extent with the whites, and who, therefore, must continue to exist as a separate class.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>That they are, as a class, decidedly inferior to the whites in point of intellectual and moral development, so much so as to be incompetent to self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>Although they have shared largely in the progress of civilization, they have not reached this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>The proof is:</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>immediate emancipation is the scheme of the abolitionists proper, whilst gradual emancipation is the favorite plan of the anti-slavery party, The ground we should take is this, that no plan of emancipation, either immediate or gradual, is adapted to the present moral condition and relative circumstances of our <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>Nothing of the kind could at this time be attended with good, but only with evil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>I limit this discussion to the subject of gradual <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>emancipation, because the reasons by which we invalidate this doctrine will, <hi rend="italics">a fortiori</hi>, disprove the doctrine of immediate emancipation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>It is said that a system of gradual emancipation succeeded well in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and that it would succeed equally well in the <rs>Southern</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>But I deny the assumption in each case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>There never was a large slave population in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, owing to the unsuitableness of the climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>The question arises, How did this system operate with the few they had?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>It is well known that the owners anticipated the time appointed for the law of emancipation to go into operation, and sold their slaves in the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>This law only operated to transfer the slaves, for the most part, to a climate and soil more congenial to their constitution and habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>The operation of the scheme, therefore, resulted only in the emancipation of a few of the whole number, (see Lecture I., <ref n="page 22">page 22</ref>;) and these few, as has been proved, have, by the social, and, we may add, in many instances, by the municipal regulations of the <name>States</name> within which they reside, been essentially injured by the change instead of benefited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>Hence the scheme did not succeed well in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>And can it be assumed that it would succeed better in the <rs>Southern States</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>On the contrary, the result would be much more fatal <pb id="p.212" n="212"/>in the <rs>Southern</rs>, for the reason that we have a much larger <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slave population than existed in the <rs>Northern States</rs> at the time their emancipation laws were adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>Now, suppose (what, however, can scarcely, if at all, be allowed a supposable case) that all the <rs>Southern States</rs> should simultaneously pass laws, providing for the gradual emancipation of the slaves, and hence, ultimately, effect their emancipation, as provided for by law, for the reason that there would be no market open for the sale of them, as was the case when the scheme was attempted at the <rs>North</rs>: even in such a state of things, you cannot fail to perceive that the propriety of such a measure turns entirely upon the truth or error of a position already discussed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>If my position be correct, (and it is evidently Established by the facts adduced in the preceding lecture,) that their mental imbecility and moral degradation is such that, whilst it remains a fact that for physical and uncontrollable causes they cannot amalgamate, any material addition to our present number of free colored population would result in their extermination, humanity, leaving all other reasons out of the account, would forbid the measure!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>Nor can I persuade myself that there is an emancipationist, however fanatical, this side the strange delirium of a deliberately wicked <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>purpose to do wrong, who would not <quote>pause upon the brink of this <placeName key="tgn,2122297;tgn,2026089;tgn,2009415;tgn,1129218" n="0.014 000000.5450	placename;tgn,2122297;Rubicon, Dodge, Wisconsin,Dodge,Wisconsin,United States,North and Central America;0.014 000000.5450	placename;tgn,2026089;Rubicon, Adams, Idaho,Adams,Idaho,United States,North and Central America;0.014 000000.5450	placename;tgn,2009415;Rubicon, Saline, Arkansas,Saline,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America;0.014 000000.5450	placename;tgn,1129218;Rubicon, California, United States,California,United States,North and Central America" reg="Rubicon, Dodge, Wisconsin,Dodge,Wisconsin,United States,North and Central America;Rubicon, Adams, Idaho,Adams,Idaho,United States,North and Central America;Rubicon, Saline, Arkansas,Saline,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America;Rubicon, California, United States,California,United States,North and Central America">Rubicon</placeName>,</quote> when assured that the <rs>Southern</rs> people generally believed that extermination would, in all probability, be the result of his priceless experiment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>But it is extremely idle to suppose that all the <rs>Southern States</rs> would simultaneously pass such a law; nor does the scheme assume that they would do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>Let us now inquire what this plan promises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>If the owners of slaves in the <name>States</name> which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in order passed such a law, did not anticipate the time of its taking effect, (as in the case before referred to,) and sell them in the <name>States</name> where no such law had, as yet, been passed, the result would be, as already stated, an accumulation of free colored population, with its inevitable consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>But this would certainly not be the general operation of such a law. For if cupidity should not prompt a different course, the owners, foreseeing the results of such an accumulation of free colored population, both to the whites and <pb id="p.214" n="214"/>the blacks, would anticipate the law, in by far the greater number of instances, and sell their slaves in the <name>States</name> in which no such law had been passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>Still, many, no doubt, would not take this course: a want of forecast, and most generally a mistaken notion of humanity, would prevent its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>In this way, we cannot hesitate to believe that the accumulation of free colored population would be so great as to induce their extermination at no distant day. This calamity could be averted only by a sale of the slaves into some other State in anticipation of the law providing for their manumission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>Now, whatever of mere selfishness there may be in the proposed measure, nothing is more certain than that it is entirely destitute of all humanity for the slave, and of all just regard to his progress in civilization, and his more speedy elevation to moral fitness for freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>For by the tile this work had progressed through the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and, it might be, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, the far greater part of the numerous slave population of the whole country would be accumulated in the remaining States of the <name>South</name> and <name>South</name>-west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>This would be the inevitable result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>For the free-soilers, it seems, are determined, if the effect of agitation <pb id="p.215" n="215"/>can accomplish it at the ballot-box, that there shall be a cordon of free States, formed by the newly acquired territory of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>; and in this case there would be no further outlet for the retiring slave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>Let us now inquire what would be the effect of the accumulation of the race within the limits of a few States:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>At present, that element of slavery which is properly called domestic, confers incalculable advantages on the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>By this feature of the system, as it now operates, the slaves are distributed in small numbers in different families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>There they are brought, every <num value="1">one</num> of them, into more or less of immediate contact with a high state of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>Many of them pass the early part of their lives in the dwelling-houses, and around the tables and firesides of their owners, and in the midst of all the company visiting the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>Others are engaged in field and mechanical pursuits, requiring frequent intercourse with the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>Their Sabbaths are often spent (and it is daily becoming more and more so) in the midst of our worshipping assemblies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>In all these ways, to go no farther, they enjoy the means of improvement, and are making daily progress in civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>This, without doubt, is the plan indicated by <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, as affording the most natural <pb id="p.216" n="216"/>means of accomplishing their ultimate fitness for a more desirable form of civil liberty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>That it cannot be said of any material portion of them that they have thrown off the incubus of preceding ages of barbarism, may be true; yet it is equally true that their progress in civilization, and that in an increasing ratio, is perfectly obvious to any man whose age and acquaintance with the race would entitle his opinion to credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>Any old man amongst us is prepared to speak of the great improvement of slaves within <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>The domestic element of the system has accomplished this improvement, and will certainly in process of time greatly elevate the race above what it now is; and they are now a very different people from their forefathers who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came into this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>I have no hesitation in believing that it is the grand design of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> that they shall be thus fitted (the far greater portion of them) for position in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> as the source of civilization to that long-benighted continent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>Now, to take from the present system its domestic element, or, what is virtually the same thing, to place it under such disabilities as to prevent its benevolent results, would arrest the progress of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> civilization, and put off his moral elevation for ages to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>And this is precisely the effect which the accumulation of all the slaves of <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>the whole country within the limits of a few States must have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>The domestic element of the system would be effectually crippled, if not entirely destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>A large number of slaves would be congregated on single plantations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>The whole territory would be in the possession of but a few wealthy planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>They would chiefly reside in the cities and more healthy districts of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>Their plantations would be under the control of stewards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>The steward and his family (usually small) would constitute the whole white population on a plantation, numbering, as would often be the case, several <num value="100">hundred</num> slaves; and the same state of things would exist, to a greater or less extent, through large districts of country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>This would be a condition of the race essentially different from that in which they are placed by the present system; and we cannot fail to perceive that they would be well-nigh cut off from all contact with civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>Instead of continuing to rise in the scale of civilization, as they will do under the present system, they would begin at once to relapse into the barbarism of their original pagan state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>This result would be inevitable-only so far as their downward progress might be arrested by the occasional voice of the self-sacrificing missionary, calling to the altars of <name>Christian</name> worship!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>Would this be humane?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>Rather, would <pb id="p.218" n="218"/>it not be brutal?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>Yet such would be the result of the scheme of <quote>gradual emancipation!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>There is, however, another result of this pseudophilanthropy that I need not omit to mention: the removal of the slaves from the <name>States</name> named, and the extermination of the remaining free colored population, should they be found to exist (as it is most likely they would) in numbers so great as to constitute a nuisance requiring summary abatement, would make a fine opening for the enterprising farmers of the <rs>Northern States</rs> to come in and possess these fertile hills and valleys, abounding in wealth and blessed with a most salubrious climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>It would also afford a fine outlet for their own menial population, which threatens so many and serious results to them &mdash; the papal vice and ignorance from <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> and the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, which is now flooding the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>How far these lofty considerations may constitute items in the catalogue of motives which prompt the political agitators of the country to press the subject of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> emancipation, I pretend not to say <num value="1">One</num> thing, however, I may say in behalf of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and that is, that as they have no idea of perpetrating these cruel wrongs upon the unfortunate race which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has thrown amongst them, so they expect to have no use for those depraved and <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>perishing menials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>They prefer the slaves, in any view of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>We may conclude, then, that the position established is not weakened in any degree by considerations of either direct or gradual emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>No: the emancipation and removal to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> of those, and those only, whose moral and social condition entitles them to a higher form of political freedom, as the voluntary act of the individual owner, is the only natural and safe method of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>It affords the only hope of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, and of the <name>African</name> in <placeName key="tgn,7012149;tgn,2131963;tgn,2131961;tgn,2131960;tgn,2026331;tgn,2002460" n="0.012 000000.8390	placename;tgn,7012149;United States, North and Central America, ,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8390	placename;tgn,2131963;America City, Nemaha, Kansas,Nemaha,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8390	placename;tgn,2131961;America, McCurtain, Oklahoma,McCurtain,Oklahoma,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8390	placename;tgn,2131960;America, Wabash, Indiana,Wabash,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8390	placename;tgn,2026331;America, Pulaski, Illinois,Pulaski,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8390	placename;tgn,2002460;America, Walker, Alabama,Walker,Alabama,United States,North and Central America" reg="United States, North and Central America, ,North and Central America;America City, Nemaha, Kansas,Nemaha,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;America, McCurtain, Oklahoma,McCurtain,Oklahoma,United States,North and Central America;America, Wabash, Indiana,Wabash,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;America, Pulaski, Illinois,Pulaski,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;America, Walker, Alabama,Walker,Alabama,United States,North and Central America">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>The proposition discussed, and, I think, clearly established, relates to the essential propriety and the fitness of the system of domestic slavery as an institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>Whether this institution is capable of improvement, and, if so, what improvements are demanded by the progress of civilization, are questions quite independent of any thing yet discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>These topics may engage our attention at a future period in these lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>I would only remark, in this place, that the system has undergone great modifications since its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>Laws and usages that were, no doubt, eminently adapted to the extremely barbarous character of the race, when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought into the country, have long since become obsolete, and the same may be said of many subsequent regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>Even the stringent measures adopted on the rise of abolition <pb id="p.220" n="220"/>excitement in late years, have had but a brief authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>The progress of civilization is the same in its results in this case as in that of any other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>As a state of barbarism yields to the light of civilization, men are more and more disposed to do right, and the laws and usages which were before necessary to compel them to do right, are thereby superseded, and soon grow into disuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>Hence, many of our Northern citizens who form their opinions (as many do) of the practical character of this institution at the present day from the historical account of the laws and usages of a former period, regardless of the fact that they have become, for the most part, obsolete, entertain a very incorrect opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>The institution at this day is a very different affair, practically, from what they suppose it to be, judging, as they do, from the laws and usages appropriate to a more barbarous condition of the race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>I have no hesitation in affirming that in by far the greater number of instances, the condition of Southern families, embracing domestic slaves, is much better (that is, both whites and blacks) than that of the larger number of Northern families, with hired domestics, on large farms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>The labor is much less severe, and the discipline much less strict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>The Northern family has more frequently to appeal to the authority of civil law, and to the <pb id="p.221" n="221"/>right of dismissing unfaithful servants, than the <rs>Southern</rs> has to appeal to domestic discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>And still further, the <rs>Southern</rs> domestic is practically, in all respects save <num value="1">one</num>, quite as much upon a social footing with the white members of the family as the <rs>Northern</rs> domestic is with the family in which he is employed, whilst the sympathy existing between these different castes in the <rs>Southern</rs> family is much greater than that which exists in the <rs>Northern</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>I acknowledge but <num value="1">one</num> difference in regard to practical social equality between the domestics of these families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>The white domestic, from the fact that he belongs to the same race, is capable, by industry and enterprise, of rising to an entire social footing with his employer, whilst the <name>African</name> domestic cannot do so. Although the civil law should confer on him the right to do so, the paramount usages of civilized life, founded upon his physical condition, would forbid it. This advantage, we admit, is above all price; but having its foundation in the wise and inscrutable providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, it is without remedy by any means which we can adopt; and, indeed, why should we wish even to alter a condition of things founded in physical nature by Him <quote>who is too wise to err and too good to do wrong,</quote> simply because to our limited view of the <name>Divine</name> economy it presents <pb id="p.222" n="222"/>points of friction which, viewing them from another stand-point, we should desire to avoid!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>But aside from this advantage, I feel free to affirm, that in every neighborhood which is brought permanently under the influence of the apostolic precepts enjoining the relative duties of master and slave, the practical working of the system secures to the <name>African</name> a higher degree of essential happiness than is found to exist with the whites who fill the menial offices of society in the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>No white man can be satisfied with the position of a menial in society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>Perpetually chafed by the chains which fetter all his attempts to rise in the scale of social equality, he is the subject of a constant and painful irritation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>Every failure in an enterprise which promised to elevate him to social equality with those around him, is a new cause of heart-burning and jealousy of all about him, and often an overwhelming source of temptation, not only to distrust the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, but to employ the political franchise to unsettle the foundations of society, by levelling down the whole to a common platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>Hence the agrarian doctrines which find embodiment in various social organizations in the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>Nothing but that religion which both teaches the duty and imparts the moral power to <quote>be careful for nothing, but in every thing to give thanks,</quote> and in every condition <pb id="p.223" n="223"/>in which <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> places us, <quote>there &mdash; with to be content,</quote> can reconcile a white menial to his condition in such a country as ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>The government itself can only be secure in a republic so long as a pure Christianity (for that only can do it) operates to elevate the social condition of those laboring classes who would otherwise be menials, or reconcile them to a station to which the accident of birth, miscarriage in business, or inferiority in intellect, inevitably consigns them in the competition of business life; or so long as pure religion shall so operate as to leave the balance of political power with those who are either so elevated or so reconciled to an inferior condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>But little, if any thing, of all this, so far as it relates to our colored menials, is to be found at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>Always conscious of their intellectual inferiority (I speak of the masses) from constant contact with the superior moral power of the whites, and equally conscious that their physical condition is an impassable bar to all social equality by marriage, they not only do not aspire to it in their feelings, but, in all cases in which they are treated as the <name>Scriptures</name> require masters to treat their servants, they learn to be contented with their lot, and, looking to their owners as their lawful and safe protectors, become affectionately attached to the whole family, and, dismissing all care, are the most <pb id="p.224" n="224"/>cheerful and, indeed, merry class of people we have amongst us. A slave who did not think more of himself, and feel himself to be better off; in all respects, than the state which agreed with his idea of what he calls <quote>poor white folks</quote> and <quote>free niggers,</quote> really would not be worth having as a house servant in any <name>Christian</name> family of my acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>Indeed, in freedom from care, and all the elements of a mere temporal happiness, the slaves of an enlightened and well-ordered family are often in a much more desirable situation than the heads of the family, who are occupied with the duty of caring for all and of providing for all. For the master of such a family to plod his weary way to daily labor on his farm, with a care-worn countenance, which traces itself in his slow and measured step, whilst the loud laugh of his merry hearted slaves is echoing around him, is no uncommon thing in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>As to the corroding cares which weigh down the spirits and often bring on premature old age, the condition of heads of families do not perhaps materially differ in any part of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>But, I repeat, the difference is very great between the menials of families in the free and in the slave States, and this difference is greatly in favor of the slaves of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>The <num value="1">one</num>--especially in the cities &mdash; is often oppressed by a grinding poverty, and an <pb id="p.225" n="225"/>active discontent which is as corroding to the heart as it is dangerous to the state; whilst the other is a stranger, for the most part, to real want &mdash; is free from painful cares, contented and cheerful in his condition &mdash; adding daily to the progress of civilization and the permanency of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>The emancipation and removal to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> of those whose progress in civilization has so far developed their minds as to constitute them exceptions to this remark, for the reason that they are by their moral condition fitted for a higher form of civil freedom, may be allowed as the voluntary act of the owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>But all other schemes of emancipation, whether immediate or gradual, are totally inadmissible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>For if successful, for the reason that they cannot share social equality with the whites, they sink in the scale of civilization, and become a nuisance in the community requiring abatement; and if the scheme should prove a failure, the result of the effort can only be, as we have seen, to accumulate large bodies of slaves within small districts of country, cut them off from a more direct contact with civilization, and arrest their progress in improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>No: emancipation in the popular sense offers no relief to any of the evils, real or imaginary, of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery in <placeName key="tgn,7012149;tgn,2131963;tgn,2131961;tgn,2131960;tgn,2026331;tgn,2002460" n="0.010 000000.7270	placename;tgn,7012149;United States, North and Central America, ,North and Central America;0.010 000000.7270	placename;tgn,2131963;America City, Nemaha, Kansas,Nemaha,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.7270	placename;tgn,2131961;America, McCurtain, Oklahoma,McCurtain,Oklahoma,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.7270	placename;tgn,2131960;America, Wabash, Indiana,Wabash,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.7270	placename;tgn,2026331;America, Pulaski, Illinois,Pulaski,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.7270	placename;tgn,2002460;America, Walker, Alabama,Walker,Alabama,United States,North and Central America" reg="United States, North and Central America, ,North and Central America;America City, Nemaha, Kansas,Nemaha,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;America, McCurtain, Oklahoma,McCurtain,Oklahoma,United States,North and Central America;America, Wabash, Indiana,Wabash,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;America, Pulaski, Illinois,Pulaski,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;America, Walker, Alabama,Walker,Alabama,United States,North and Central America">America</placeName>; but rather aggravates all that now exist, and threatens to multiply them a <num value="1000">thousand</num>-fold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>By doing this they will lighten the task of masters, and, at the same time, interest them more deeply in all that concerns the welfare of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>They will greatly improve the physical comfort of the slaves, and, what is of far greater importance, they will develop their moral natures, and therein add to their present cheerful and contented state, the enjoyment of that religion which, as it fits them for the higher walks of life on earth, at the same time fits them for the rest of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>In a word, they will effect all that the most devoted friend of the slave can reasonably desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>For in this state of advanced progress, whatever modification of the system or change in either the condition or location of the race may be demanded by sound principles, will be readily adopted, and as peaceably effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>Thus the long-disputed problem <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>of emancipation will be found to solve itself, But instead of this active and efficient service in the cause of humanity, to stand aloof and pronounce silly and sluggish invectives &mdash; for such they really are &mdash; against the <rs>South</rs>, for not following the example of certain Northern States in manumitting their slaves,--which, by the way, we have shown they never did to any material extent,--is calculated only to produce an irritation which must result in the most incurable prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>These invectives are often founded upon certain abstract principles of political philosophy which are usually misunderstood, and still more frequently misapplied to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Such men, together with the nature and results of their labors, are graphically described by the <rs>Apostle Paul</rs>, as <quote>proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil-surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/><num value="1">one</num> point remains to be considered to complete a full and candid view of the <hi rend="italics">institution</hi> of domestic slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>It is erroneously said that <quote>we <hi rend="italics">keep</hi> the <name>African</name> in a state of barbarism, and then plead that barbarism in vindication of our policy.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>Every thing is liable to abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>I know that there are instances in the <rs>South</rs> of great neglect <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>of the slaves, both of their moral and physical condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>The same may be said of individuals at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>Superiors often neglect their inferiors, and that, in many instances, to a very culpable degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>I know no efficient remedy for this, but that which the diffusion of a pure Christianity is calculated to afford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>If any complain of these neglects in a captious spirit, we have nothing to hope from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>But from those who claim to be sincere, we have a right to expect an active and hearty cooperation in diffusing Christianity, as the only thing calculated to afford a remedy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>But it is said that a feature of the system, as established by law, <hi rend="italics">necessarily</hi> produces this result: that is, the law which excludes the <name>African</name> from the benefits of school instruction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>The term <hi rend="italics">necessarily</hi> is in this instance certainly misapplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>The barbarism in question is not the result of this law, <hi rend="italics">necessarily</hi>, or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>It existed originally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>It still exists, and to a great extent, though greatly modified; and in the present circumstances of the race, an authorized system of school instruction would cause it to continue to exist, and perhaps in a much greater degree than it now does, and for a longer time than it promises to do under the present system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>If this be so, it is the semi-barbarism that creates <pb id="p.230" n="230"/>the necessity for the <hi rend="italics">law</hi>, and not the <hi rend="italics">law</hi> that makes the barbarism the <hi rend="italics">necessary</hi> result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>An unwieldy mass of semi-barbarism dwelling in the midst of a civilized community, with whom they cannot amalgamate by intermarriage, will, at all times, require a peculiar system of appliances for their improvement, so as to make it consistent with the common welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>The principle of slavery must, of course, be kept in vigorous operation, and the means of improvement be wisely adapted to the state of the pupil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>Otherwise, there may not only be a very improvident expenditure of means, but the most disastrous results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>The horn-book might be a valuable agent in the hands of a child, but the instruments and agents in a chemical laboratory might prove its ruin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>Should the time ever arrive (which in the opinion of some will be the case, at some distant day) when the progress of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> civilization will justify it; and when an asylum in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> is provided for them &mdash; together with the means of their removal in large numbers &mdash; I have no doubt that a system of popular education would not only be indicated as proper, but afford <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant fields for the display of public and of individual benevolence, that has ever yet presented itself in behalf of that degraded race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>But what I have to say of this hypothesis is, that if it ever <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>should, the generations &mdash; both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>--that may then live, I have no doubt, will have both sagacity enough to perceive it, and benevolence enough to improve it to the mutual advantage of themselves and the <name>African</name> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>But it is very evident that neither of these conditions has been fulfilled as yet. In this state of things, it cannot be supposed that the <rs>Southern</rs> people are prepared for any enterprise of the kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>I cannot imagine that any public movement, having for its object the instruction of the blacks in reading and writing, could be made without involving the most disastrous results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>Let us suppose that a majority in our legislative councils were in favor of such a measure, and were actually to tax the people to support a system of primary education for the blacks : any man would certainly be excessively stupid who would not allow that a minority would, at all times, (in the present state of public experience,) exist, who deemed the law sufficiently oppressive to justify repudiation and physical resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>If this object were sought to be accomplished by individual enterprise, the results could scarcely be less embarrassing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>This will readily appear; for it would have to be effected either in the common schools of the country, or by the establishment of separate schools for the <name>Africans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>But I am not <pb id="p.232" n="232"/>aware that the former is allowed to any material extent even in the free States, where certainly, if the scheme were practicable, the free blacks might be educated in the same schools with the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>The usage of civilization, which denies them a social footing in so many other respects, must, of course, so far deny them this privilege as to render the scheme mainly ineffectual in the accomplishment of good, or the usage is singularly inconsistent with itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>And can it be supposed that such a scheme would operate better in the <rs>South</rs>, where the reasons against it are a <num value="1000">thousand</num>-fold stronger, growing out of the large number of the <name>African</name> population?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>Certainly nothing could be more utopian than an enterprise of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>Public opinion would scarcely be sufficiently divided to justify even the wildest schemer in making a serious attempt to effect it. The latter plan might perhaps be attempted, but, on account of the evils it would involve, it would still be subject to impassable objections.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>Slaves, though not owned by the poor, are held for the most part by farmers and planters whose pecuniary circumstances are what is called moderate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>There are exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>Occasionally, they are held by men of wealth; but in the older States particularly, (and of these I speak from <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>personal knowledge,) the great mass of those who own them cannot be said, in any popular sense of the term, to be rich.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>Now, the habits of half-labor, as any Northern man would regard them, in which the slaves are usually indulged, would put it quite out of the power of most of slave-owners to afford the necessary support for such schools, however favorable they might be to the scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>Withal, there is but little if any room to doubt that a great many, both among the rich as well as the poor, would oppose the measure, for what appeared to them reasons of sound policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>This would leave the scheme to be supported entirely by the few rich men, whose benevolence might lead them to overlook the strong popular objections against it. It requires no particular sagacity to foresee the practical mischiefs which would attend the efforts of a few rich men who might attempt to override the popular feeling on a subject of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>Public opinion would put it down!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>This would be the end of it in <num value="1">one</num> direction, but not in another.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>The whole movement would be attended, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, with an irritation of the public mind in the highest degree unfavorable, and, indeed, dangerous to the peace and prosperity of the commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>All irritations of the public mind in regard to the blacks, it is well known, result <pb id="p.234" n="234"/>injuriously to them, generally abridging them of their civil privileges and social comforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>In this instance, viewing the subject as a practical question, I cannot see that it would be attended with a single redeeming virtue, so far as the blacks are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>But to place it in the most favorable light, let us suppose that, by some means, <num value="1">one</num> or the other of these plans had actually gone into operation &mdash; which, by the way, can scarcely be conceived to be possible in the present state of society &mdash; and had already made a decided impression upon the public mind of the <name>Africans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>Even in this case it would still be liable to strong and impassable objections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>It would be educating them in advance of their circumstances and prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>In their circumstances, it would be even more objectionable than it could be to take the time and labor of a white youth, which (we will also suppose) were required for the immediate support of himself and of those depending upon his labor, and educate him for the learned pursuits of a Newton or a Macaulay, whilst at the same time, for causes beyond his control, he was doomed for the remainder of his days to work in the mines of <placeName key="tgn,2016736;tgn,7008116;tgn,2258010;tgn,2109544;tgn,1014693" n="0.022 000000.4362	placename;tgn,2016736;cornwall, litchfield, connecticut,Litchfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;0.015 000000.2912	placename;tgn,7008116;cornwall,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe;0.007 000000.1454	placename;tgn,2258010;corwall-on-hudson, orange, new york,Orange,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.004 000000.0727	placename;tgn,2109544;cornwall, addison, vermont,Addison,Vermont,United States,North and Central America;0.003 000000.0546	placename;tgn,1014693;cornwall, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="cornwall, litchfield, connecticut,Litchfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;cornwall,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe;corwall-on-hudson, orange, new york,Orange,New York,United States,North and Central America;cornwall, addison, vermont,Addison,Vermont,United States,North and Central America;cornwall, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Cornwall</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,2095539;tgn,2111165;tgn,2049595" n="0.036 000000.4362	placename;tgn,2095539;chesterfield, chesterfield, south carolina,Chesterfield,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;0.024 000000.2908	placename;tgn,2111165;chesterfield, chesterfield, virginia,Chesterfield,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.1454	placename;tgn,2049595;chesterfield, hampshire county, massachusetts,Hampshire,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America" reg="chesterfield, chesterfield, south carolina,Chesterfield,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;chesterfield, chesterfield, virginia,Chesterfield,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;chesterfield, hampshire county, massachusetts,Hampshire,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America">Chesterfield</placeName>, by the light of <persName n="Davy,Sir,Humphrey,,," id="n0062.0011.00234.00136" reg="default:Davy,Humphrey,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Humphrey</foreName> <surname>Davy</surname></persName>'s lamp!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>No <num value="1">one</num> of the important objects of so high an education is accessible to him. The least part of the objection to <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>such a course as this is, that it would be a useless expenditure of time and labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>But the reason is much stronger in the case of the <name>African</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>The civil offices are <hi rend="italics">all</hi> closed against him. No <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> of the learned professions is open to him. The Law of caste which forbids his amalgamation bars him out from every thing of the kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>He is doomed to occupy, so long as he remains in the midst of a white community, the position of an inferior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> himself has so ordered it. The bold line of distinction he has drawn between the races, is fully declarative of his will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>He only can reverse the decree, <quote>The <rs>Ethiopian</rs> cannot change his skin,</quote> any more than <quote>the leopard can change his spots.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>In this state of facts, would not the public mind &mdash; whose decisions must be authoritative in the settlement of such a question &mdash; very naturally inquire for <hi rend="italics">the good</hi> that it was thought might result from so material a change in the circumstances of the institution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>And is it not obvious that no answer could be given that would insure satisfaction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>No power of eloquence with which it is competent to enforce the claims of education, could possibly move the public mind from the sober conviction that the advantages and privileges of education, so necessary to a state of civil liberty, and so appropriate in other respects to that state, could not, with any <pb id="p.236" n="236"/>degree of propriety be demanded in behalf of a necessary condition of slavery!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>Thus far, the principles of political economy, alone considered, would, in the public estimation, fully settle this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>But this is not all. The question has much graver aspects than money can possibly give it. The effect of generally enlisting the <name>African</name> mind in literary pursuits and inquiries is too obvious either to be overlooked or slightly regarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>A state of popular disquietude must inevitably result, and this, too, at a time when the door of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> remains effectually closed against his release from slavery and his removal to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>This disquietude could not fail to lead to many fanatical and fruitless attempts to effect a change in the political condition of the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>Such a state of popular solicitude among the blacks would of course be followed by much greater solicitude and even irritation on the part of the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>So potent a cause would certainly precipitate its appropriate results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>The oppressive and, in some respects, the savage laws by which ancient <placeName key="tgn,7011065;tgn,7011058" n="0.018 000000.1820	placename;tgn,7011065;name,Nomos Lakonias,Peloponnisos,Ellas,Europe;0.018 000000.1820	placename;tgn,7011058;name,Nomos Lakonias,Peloponnisos,Ellas,Europe" reg="name,Nomos Lakonias,Peloponnisos,Ellas,Europe;name,Nomos Lakonias,Peloponnisos,Ellas,Europe">Sparta, Greece</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> governed their slaves &mdash; some of who were highly educated men &mdash; would of necessity be reenacted in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>Our present mild a form of slavery would be substituted by a form of oppression unknown to the history of this country, even in the most barbarous <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>condition of the <name>African</name> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>And thus would end the chapter of abolition benevolence in behalf of the <name>African</name> race in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>In view of these considerations, the policy of the <rs>South</rs> on this subject, allow me to affirm, is founded no less in benevolence to the <name>African</name> and the peace of the commonwealth, than in the soundest principles of political economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>It relies upon the <hi rend="italics">domestic</hi> element of the system of slavery, as the <hi rend="italics">natural</hi>, the only <hi rend="italics">safe</hi>, and ultimately the <hi rend="italics">effectual</hi> means of the intellectual and moral elevation of the <name>African</name> &mdash; so far as any means can be effectual in the accomplishment of that object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/><num value="1">1</num>. It is the <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> way &mdash; that is, the way adapted to their condition as an inferior and naturally distinct race, who, both on account of the physical facts which constitute them a distinct race, and the low state of civilization (if it may be called civilization at all) which they have yet been able to attain, should not be admitted to a social footing by intermarriage with the superior race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>In a former lecture, it was demonstrated that an uncivilized race, dwelling in the midst of a civilized community, had <hi rend="italics">no right</hi> to social equality, and, for a still stronger reason, <hi rend="italics">no right</hi> to political sovereignty in such a community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>It was also shown that their natural rights entitled them to <hi rend="italics">protection</hi>, and reasonable provision for their <hi rend="italics">improvement</hi>, <pb id="p.238" n="238"/>and, as in the case of minors, to such <quote><hi rend="italics">authoritative control</hi></quote> as is best calculated to preserve their power of self-action &mdash; their power of volition &mdash; from that enslavement to the baser passions of depraved nature, which is destructive of all true liberty, and the most degraded and ruinous form of slavery &mdash; subjection to the devil; in comparison with which, a physical subjection to a fellow-man, in civilized life, with a power, defined by law, only to control his time and labor to a reasonable extent, is a paradise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>These &mdash; we of the <rs>South</rs> say &mdash; are their <hi rend="italics">natural rights</hi>--the good to which they are entitled in virtue of their humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>Now as these rights are in their nature relative, they imply the <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> on the part of the civilized race amongst whom, in the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, they dwell, to afford them both the <hi rend="italics">protection</hi> and <hi rend="italics">control</hi> in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>Their duty, in these respects, is clearly reciprocal with the <hi rend="italics">rights</hi> of the <name>Africans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>They can no more omit these duties to the blacks with impunity, than they can do so to the minors and imbeciles of their own race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Now what form of control will more naturally or appropriately fulfil the conditions of this problem?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>They are to exercise the <hi rend="italics">sovereign</hi> control: all political freedom is denied the blacks by their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>They have no right to it. It is not, to them, the essential good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>Their <hi rend="italics">rights</hi> lie, <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>as in the case of imbecies of any other race, in being governed, not in governing themselves, in those matters which constitute the objects of civil government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>To exercise this sovereign control of the blacks, and at the same time afford them the <hi rend="italics">protection</hi> and <hi rend="italics">improvement</hi> which are appropriate to a necessary condition of slavery, or state of subjection to such sovereign control, is the solemn <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> of the superior race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>The position here advocated is, that the <hi rend="italics">domestic</hi> element of the present system in operation amongst us, affords a more perfect guaranty that all the conditions of this problem will be fulfilled, than could be effected by any other system, or by the proposed modification of the present system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>The element in question constitutes for them an invaluable school of instruction &mdash; a school in which both the mental and moral nature is developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>A school for the formal instruction of the blacks in letters, we have seen would operate only to defeat the end proposed by its establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>To govern and protect them, and at the same time make them useful to themselves and to society, by a system of military police, could find but few if any advocates, even among the visionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>But what more natural than to accomplish all these objects, by a system which distributes them n small numbers through the different families of civilized life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>Here they <pb id="p.240" n="240"/>are brought into immediate connection with much that is calculated to develop the mind, cultivate the moral sense, and train the will to the habit of obedience to its high behests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>The law confers upon the head of the family the same right to direct and appropriate the time and labor of the blacks, that he enjoys in the case of his children &mdash; and no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>The period of time to which this authority extends, differs in the <num value="1">one</num> case from that of the other; but this is the only difference known to the law. Great abuses of this authority sometimes occur in the case of the blacks; but the same is occasionally true of parental authority in all parts of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>The former may furnish a fit theme for the perverted genius of <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,Harriet,,," id="n0062.0011.00240.00137" reg="default:Stowe,Harriet,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Harriet</foreName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>The fruit of such a genius may have a poetry &mdash; of its kind; but it can lay claim to neither philosophy nor common sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>The same force of logic which is hurled against the authority of the master, rakes the authority of the parent in the line of its fire, with an effect no less destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>Both are equally necessary; both are equally protected by law; and both are open to great abuses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>The poetry which invests these abuses with the show of argument against the authority of the master may cater to the corrupt taste of both the <quote>great vulgar</quote> and the <quote>little vulgar;</quote> but it is the same cormorant <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>appetite which is fed, that leads the <hi rend="italics">mere</hi> <quote>readers and cipherers</quote> of the land to turn aside from those valuable productions so appropriate to their real wants, and delight themselves in tragic stories of murder, arson, and rape, from the perusal of which they rise with passions inflamed to crusade against the morals of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>Christianity sternly rebukes the abuses complained of; and equally condemns that perversion of genius which employs those abuses to corrupt the public taste and the public morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>As far as Christianity prevails, the civil law which requires humanity in the exercise of domestic authority, no less in the case of the slave than in the case of the child or the apprentice, is sanctioned, and, in cases demanding it, is duly enforced by public opinion and sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>In all communities in which Christianity is the presiding influence, <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery must, therefore, be a mild form of domestic servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>It even contributes in a measure to a knowledge of letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>Many servants are raised by their associations with civilized life to a desire to read the word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>The domestic relation often supplies them with the means of gratifying this desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>Many pious slaves read the word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as a part of their family worship; and instances are not wanting of those of whom it may be said, they <quote>are mighty in the <name>Scriptures</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>Such are the tendencies <pb id="p.242" n="242"/>and capabilities of domestic slavery as a system recognized by law; and apart from those abuses which all good men deplore &mdash; no less in the case of the slave than in the case of the child and the apprentice, who are no further protected from inhumanity by the provisions of law than is the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>Hence this system is the natural way of protecting, improving, and governing the <name>African</name> for the mutual benefit of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>It is evidently indicated by <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>No other can be appropriate to a mass of population who can never be politically free in our midst, for the reason that, in the order of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, they never can amalgamate with us. But it is,</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>It is slow, it is true, but it is for that reason only the more safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>Its effects are, for the most part, without observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>Hence, it produces no irritation of the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>It develops the law of sympathy on both sides in the ratio in which it unfolds the intellectual and moral nature of the subordinate race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>It raises no visionary and fanatical hopes in the <num value="1">one</num>, nor excites any morbid fears in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>I say, its results march forward without observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>A <hi rend="italics">revenue tariff</hi>, for example, affords a full support to the government by a virtual tax upon the pockets of the people; and it does this at a time when they <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>would not for a moment consent to pay that tax, if it were made a <hi rend="italics">direct</hi> tax, to be collected by the authority of an exciseman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>So, without observation, the domestic element of slavery is accomplishing its results, with equal safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>Or, more in point, perhaps, it is like the <quote>kingdom of heaven,</quote> which <quote>comes without observation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>The <quote>kingdom of heaven,</quote> in the form of <hi rend="italics">principles</hi>, diffuses itself through the mass of society, and ultimately works, as a legitimate result, the boldest political revolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>But by diffusing itself quietly, or <quote>without observation,</quote> it prepares the public mind for its changes in the exact ratio in which it effects them; and thus accomplishes that, by the popular will, the attempt to do which in another way would have razed the foundations of civil society, and closed the history of civilization for ages to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>So, this divine agent &mdash; for such I must consider it &mdash; is working constant changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>It is daily modifying the features of the system, and so developing the moral character of the <name>African</name>, as to throw him up, by successive steps, higher and still higher on the scale of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>But this it does so quietly, because naturally, that it actually works a specific result on the masters, and accomplishes its objects by the consent of their wills and their own active cooperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/><pb id="p.244" n="244"/></p> 
<p>All this, we see, is effected with entire <hi rend="italics">safety</hi>. Even in those instances-and they are numerous &mdash; in which the working of the domestic element of the system results in teaching the <name>African</name> to read, we are not aware that it involves, or even threatens, society, with any of those evils which it is so obvious a more formal system of school instruction would precipitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>Slaves who are below a certain point in civilization, cannot be induced, by any of the influences employed by young masters and mistresses, (and they are often specific,) to deal with the task of learning to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>Only those who are so far raised in the scale of civilization as to have awakened in them a hallowed desire to learn more of the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and their duty as Christians, ever avail themselves of the opportunities afforded them by their domestic relations, and learn to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>These devote a portion of their spare hours to reading the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>; and a pious <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName>, who reads his Bible, is always known and appreciated as a better servant, as well as a better man. He enjoys the respect and confidence of his owner, and is highly appreciated by all the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>I have often known the prayer of such a slave to be more relied on in times of domestic affliction than that of any minister whose services could be commanded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>But, more than this, the results which have <pb id="p.245" n="245"/>been brought to view are not only effected with safety, but also with a high degree of satisfaction to the owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>Everywhere families may be met with, who will call your attention with hallowed satisfaction to what they have done for the improvement or comfort of their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>But it will be found that this very good is just such that if you had attempted to effect it by other means than the quiet influences of the <hi rend="italics">domestic</hi> element of this system, you would, by a universal law of our nature &mdash; self-preservation---have converted each of those families into a kind of <name>Roman</name> amphitheatre, and made the unhappy slaves the chief victims of your rashness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>Hence, it is not without the gravest reasons that the intelligence of the <rs>South</rs> rebukes the fanatical spirit of abolitionists, with the most solemn assurances that they know not the things whereof they speak, when they urge upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people the duty of schooling and emancipating their slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/><num value="3">3</num>. But I also affirm that the feature of the system under consideration will ultimately effect the moral elevation of the <name>African</name>, so far as any means can be effectual in the accomplishment of this object, whilst he remains in the bosom of a community with which he cannot be admitted to a social footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/><pb id="p.246" n="246"/></p> 
<p>So unobserved is the influence of this <hi rend="italics">element</hi>, that I find but few, even among intelligent and practical men, who, before their attention is particularly called to the subject, are aware of what it has already effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>But in numerous public addresses in the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, I have appealed to the oldest and most observant men in large assemblies, and in no instance have I met with a single individual who did not concur in my statement that the present race of Africans were very materially improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>both in their moral and physical condition, above what they were some <num value="20">twenty</num> or <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, and that the change has been much greater with the slaves than with the free colored population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>Now, it is obvious that this improvement will continue to go on, and in an increasing ratio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>On the same principle that labor applied to capital is productive in an increasing ratio, the means in operation for the improvement of the <name>African</name> will greatly accelerate his progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>Hence, <hi rend="italics">some</hi> future period will present a generation of Africans highly improved above what they are now. Consequently, there will arrive, at some distant day, a period at which this people will have reached that point of moral progress at which they will be capable of appreciating, and, <hi rend="italics">in a suitable physical</hi> <pb id="p.247" n="247"/><hi rend="italics">condition, adapting them to social equality</hi>, will be prepared to occupy and wisely improve, the privileges of civil liberty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>It is on this principle that the laws of all civilized States confer the privilege of political freedom on the descendants of their free citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>At the age of <num value="21">twenty-one</num>, they are made politically free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>The law assumes, what is found generally to be true, that previously to this period they are incapable of using this privilege to the advantage of themselves and of the community; but that, at this age, their capacities are sufficiently developed to make a proper use of this privilege; and as ,neither their physical condition nor any accidents of their position operate as a bar to their social equality with other free citizens, it is conferred on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>By analogy, therefore, we may infer, that when the <name>African</name> in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> shall have reached a similar moral state, and when his physical condition and the accidents of his position shall lit him for social equality with other free citizens, a similar right of political freedom will inure to him. It will be to him <hi rend="italics">the right</hi>--that is, <hi rend="italics">the good</hi>--which ought to be allowed him. To withhold it would be despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>Now, the former condition of this problem, his moral state in this country at some future day may fulfil; but that the latter can never be fulfilled in this country is <pb id="p.248" n="248"/>obvious from the facts and reasonings already adduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>But when in future time his state shall fulfil the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> condition, it is a grave question which we may safely anticipate, whether it will not be the duty of the superior race amongst whom the <name>Africans</name> now dwell, to remove them to a land where they can enjoy social equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>We hazard nothing in deciding this question in the affirmative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>Rights and duties are reciprocal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>Then whatever it shall be the right of the <name>African</name> to claim of their superiors, it will be their duty to confer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>That they would be entitled to removal in large numbers, will appear--<num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>They will have contributed largely to develop the resources of the country, as the price of their civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/><num value="2">2</num>. It would be to them the good, without which their civilization could but partially avail them Hence, it would be the duty of their superiors to remove them in such numbers as their means of doing so might allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>But more than this, it would be a duty which they owed themselves, even if they were under no obligations to the inferior race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>For when a numerous population in our midst, though confessedly inferior, shall arise to the moral condition defined, the difficulties attending their longer continuance in a state of slavery, domestic or otherwise, will be far too great to justify the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/><pb id="p.249" n="249"/></p> 
<p>Hence I have long thought that there was usually a very unnecessary expenditure of sympathy on behalf of certain enslaved nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, as well as the <name>African</name> of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>A nation, the masses of whom have arisen to the moral condition of freedom, will assert their political rights; and they will usually do it on practicable grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>It is only at this point that they challenge public sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>For the mind was never before sufficiently free to make their situation an oppressive <num value="1">one</num>, assuming that their rulers do not abuse their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>Before this period, their rights lay in being governed &mdash; not in governing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>Political freedom would be as dangerous intrusted to them, as a razor would be in the hands of a child, and should, for the same general reasons, be withheld from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>But withheld by whom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>asks the philosophy of <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0062.0011.00249.00138" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>I answer, By those who have the intelligence to do it. Both the principle of benevolence and the law of reciprocity require this; and that intelligence which imposes this duty, can never fail to supply the means for the restraint of brute force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>Of the truth of this general position no people appear to be more sensible than the aristocracy of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/><persName n="Tocqueville,,De,,," id="n0062.0011.00249.00139" reg="default:Tocqueville,De,,,"><foreName>De</foreName> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName> clearly asserts this on their behalf, when he states that the object of his tour through the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> arose from the <pb id="p.250" n="250"/>necessity of becoming acquainted with the spirit and character of democracy, that a proper direction might be given to it in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>To direct it wisely might be done; but to crush it was utterly impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>Now if this author be correct in supposing that the spirit of democracy is truly awake among the masses of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> population, and that consequently they are asserting their right to freedom &mdash; not from the abuse of legitimate power, which calls for <hi rend="italics">reform</hi> merely, but, from the power <hi rend="italics">itself</hi>, which their improved moral and social condition has rendered no longer appropriate, and which, therefore, they now sensibly feel to be an oppression, calling for revolution &mdash; they are following the indications of nature, and there is no power in those nations that can shut the door of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>An obedient child will cheerfully submit to the reasonable though <hi rend="italics">stringent despotism</hi> exercised over him by his parent, and even look back upon it in after life with the highest pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>Nevertheless, on reaching his maturity, he will refuse to submit to it any longer, and even feel an attempt to force it upon him as an oppression too intolerable to be borne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>So, by parity of reasoning, will the masses of these nations demand an entire abolition of the existing modes of government, and claim such as are adapted to their state of maturity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>But, on the other hand, if the <pb id="p.251" n="251"/>movements in question are the work of only a few master-spirits who have mistaken the actual condition of the masses, who have not yet risen to the moral condition of freedom, they will be found to be fighting against <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>The door of his providence is closed against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>There are no means in the compass of their power by which they can force an entrance through this door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>They may shed oceans of blood, but it shall not avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>So, in the former case, the aristocracy may exhaust alike their treasures and their diplomatic resources, but it can only be to fill the land with desolation and mourning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>The enlightened popular mind and will must prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/><quote>Verily,</quote> a premature resistance in either case <quote>has its reward</quote> --great suffering, and a vast accumulation of guilt, but not success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>These principles are not without their application to the <name>Africans</name> in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>Should the remote period arrive when the state of the <name>Africans</name> fulfils the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> condition of the problem laid down, they will certainly feel their political condition in this country to be an oppressive <num value="1">one</num>, and, if necessary, assert their right to remove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>I say, assert their right to remove; for in the mental Condition assumed, they would have far too much good sense to do what many less qualified to judge than they would then be have done-ask for <hi rend="italics">political</hi> <pb id="p.252" n="252"/>equality amongst a people with whom they could never be on a footing of <hi rend="italics">social</hi> equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>I am equally satisfied that they would be under no necessity to ask this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>The intelligence and virtue, no less than the interest, of that age, will forestall such a necessity, by the measures which justice and humanity will dictate as proper to meet the circumstances of the case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>For my own part, I have no doubt that, under that wise superintending <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which has so signally marked the progress of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> civilization, by introducing so large a portion of the race into this country, that distant day, when it arrives, will provide for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>Anxious solicitude on the part of the present age is not demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>Neither the intelligence nor the benevolence of <hi rend="italics">that</hi> remote age will be unequal to the task of providing for the necessities of its times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>Already, indeed, <quote>coming events cast their shadows before.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>The elements have been long combining, both to usher in and to dispose of those events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>The <hi rend="italics">domestic</hi> element of slavery is, as we have seen, quietly and effectually doing its work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> is raising up a vast government on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, which promises to reach a respectable station among the civilized nations of the earth &mdash; in moral and physical resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>In the progress of events, there is no ground to doubt that the abolition spirit, abroad <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>in so large a portion of our country, will have had its day, and run its course through all the usual stages and phases of fanaticism, and, giving place to a sounder philanthropy and a purer benevolence, those who now advocate it will be prepared to unite with the philosophy of the <rs>South</rs>, and availing themselves of the vast resources of this great country, and of those of the new government in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, will <hi rend="italics">transport</hi> large numbers to a community in which their social equality will enable them to enjoy the freedom for which they were fitted in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>Many of those who remain will, no doubt, amalgamate with the whites, however it may be in violation of the laws of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>Those barriers which free-soilism is now erecting on our Southern border, will ultimately yield to a sounder policy, and many of our slaves will find their way to the remote <rs>South</rs>, where the state of civilization will admit of a more general amalgamation, and be lost in the <rs>Mexican</rs> races; whilst the remainder &mdash; perhaps a large number &mdash; will continue in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but in a highly improved condition, and under a form of civil government which will not be felt by them as a political oppression, and continue to bless the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>I have no idea that the race will ever become extinct in this country, or cease to exist under a subordinate government of some kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/><pb id="p.254" n="254"/></p> 
<p>I would not claim entire accuracy for these views of the distant future; but of their general accuracy I have no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>Future history will, doubtless, challenge the gratitude of the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName> for that wonderful providence by which the residence of the <name>African</name> in this country was made as the sojourn of <persName><foreName>Joseph</foreName></persName> in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>As <name n="God" type="God">God</name> sent him before his brethren <quote>to preserve life,</quote> so it will be found that he permitted the introduction of the pagan <rs>African</rs> into this country, that he might be raised by contact with civilization, redeemed by the genius of the gospel, and returned to bless his kindred and his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>Thus all <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> shall, sooner or later, share the blessings of civilization and religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>I am not able to see any thing that can or will embarrass the progress of this great work, but the spirit of a premature abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>The doctrines of emancipation and school instruction may keep up an irritated state of the public mind, that must act as a serious check to the civilizing tendencies of the <hi rend="italics">domestic</hi> element of the system; for the long-continued agitation of these questions may excite fanatical aspirants to attempt to pass limits which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has declared to be impassable &mdash; that is, to procure political freedom for a people who are not prepared for it, and that in the midst of another people with whom they can never generally amalgamate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>All <pb id="p.255" n="255"/>attempts of this sort, it is well known, are extremely hurtful to the progress of the <name>African</name> in civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>Every consideration, therefore, of policy and of humanity forbids that these doctrines should receive the slightest encouragement from an enlightened people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>The race is not prepared for the operation of either of these schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>No better evidence need be required by those not personally acquainted with the character of the <name>Africans</name>, than the fact that they have never once attempted to assert a right to political freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>The fact that, nowhere throughout the <rs>Southern States</rs>, can it be said of even a respectable minority of the race, that they have given the slightest indication of such a disposition, <hi rend="italics">is proof</hi> that they have not yet risen to that mental state, and hence are not entitled to the political privileges which are appropriate to it. It is vain to point to the few attempts at local insurrection which have occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>The highest conception which the masses have ever yet formed of political freedom is simply <hi rend="italics">liberty to do nothing</hi>. To win this cherished object of <hi rend="italics">barbarism</hi>-not of <hi rend="italics">civilization</hi>--a bare handful, on a few occasions, have concocted plans as hopeless as the spirit in which they were conceived was barbarian, and as visionary as the dreams of <persName n="Miller,,,,," id="n0062.0011.00255.00140" reg="mostcommon:Miller,nomatch:0"><surname>Miller</surname></persName> that he could make an intelligent <name>Christian</name> people believe his vagaries; or the <pb id="p.256" n="256"/>leaders of the <rs>Mormon</rs> folly and wickedness, that they could impose their grossly stupid imposture upon the civilized world.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>In view, therefore, of these facts and reasonings, we conclude that the <rs>Southern</rs> people are not obnoxious to the charge of keeping the <name>Africans</name> in a state of barbarism, by their policy, either on the subject of emancipation or of school instruction; but that they are following the indications of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, and serving the cause of humanity in the civilization of the <name>African</name> in <placeName key="tgn,7012149;tgn,2131963;tgn,2131961;tgn,2131960;tgn,2026331;tgn,2002460" n="0.012 000000.8680	placename;tgn,7012149;United States, North and Central America, ,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2131963;America City, Nemaha, Kansas,Nemaha,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2131961;America, McCurtain, Oklahoma,McCurtain,Oklahoma,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2131960;America, Wabash, Indiana,Wabash,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2026331;America, Pulaski, Illinois,Pulaski,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2002460;America, Walker, Alabama,Walker,Alabama,United States,North and Central America" reg="United States, North and Central America, ,North and Central America;America City, Nemaha, Kansas,Nemaha,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;America, McCurtain, Oklahoma,McCurtain,Oklahoma,United States,North and Central America;America, Wabash, Indiana,Wabash,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;America, Pulaski, Illinois,Pulaski,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;America, Walker, Alabama,Walker,Alabama,United States,North and Central America">America</placeName>, and the redemption of his fatherland. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/><pb id="p.259" n="259"/></p> 
<p>We live in a country of vast geographical extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>A large portion of it is uninhabited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>It is, however, rapidly filling up. Immigrants from every section of the civilized world are rapidly arriving in our eastern cities, and spreading to remote sections of our republic: men of every conceivable variety of taste, disposition, and opinion, both in politics and in religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>The fertility and abundance of our soil, and the variety of our staple articles of produce, have attracted universal activity and enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>To compare the civilized world to <num value="1">one</num> vast city, our republic seems destined to become the great market or business-street of it. Here, all is bustle and activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>Nowhere on the face of the globe is so much energy of character displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>No attentive observer can fail to perceive the tendency of all this to call off the mind from those moral and intellectual pursuits that so eminently fit men for the sober duties of life and the felicities of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>The public mind is already kept in a state of most unnatural excitement, stimulated in the highest degree to the pursuits of wealth and political distinction, to the almost-entire neglect of every other interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>This is daily becoming the supreme attraction, to which the popular impulse yields as readily as the unfortunate ship obeys the resistless circles of the maelstrom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/><pb id="p.260" n="260"/></p> 
<p>Thus far, it is true, we have succeeded to <quote>lay that broad foundation of <orgName n="Modern Society" type="society">modern society</orgName> which promises the noble superstructure of rational liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>But regarding the tendencies of this restless people, looking at the growth of our own improvidence, and at the copious additions which overstocked and perishing <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is daily sending us, in multiplied forms of ignorance and superstition, insomuch that in many respects in our Northern States our republican fabric is fast changing and passing away before our very eyes, who can exult in the certainty of success!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Who will not despair, except so far as he may be sanguine that a tone and energy of moral effort is put forth, equal to that which achieved our national liberties!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>For if this be not done, in a day we may go down into hopeless bondage!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>The physical battle of our liberties has been fought and won, and we are fast rushing up to unparalleled eminence; but from this dizzy height, if we be not sustained by some conservative power, we shall go down in a moment to the degradation of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>For let it be remembered that whilst liberty may be achieved by the sword, it cannot be maintained by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>Enlightened principles and moral excellence alone can maintain the liberty that force achieves.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>I say nothing of that large class of foreign <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>population whose education and pecuniary resources enable them to come among us from a choice of our institutions, and the other means of happiness which this great country affords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/><num value="1">1</num> bid them all welcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>They add alike to the permanency and strength of our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>Nor do I say any thing against that unfortunate multitude which accompanies these, whose ignorance and vice compel them, reluctantly or not, to seek their bread in our fruitful country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>So far as we may be able to receive them, I rejoice that we have a home for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>But it is obvious that our safety can be found only in our ability to absorb them into our political body, and impart our character to them; and in those providential arrangements which shall sustain us through the protracted process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>Without these, there is no ground to hope for success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>For what power is that which (in the language of another) <quote>has been fitly styled the <q direct="unspecified">terror of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName></q> --the power that has sent earthquake after earthquake, rolling under the deep foundations of governments, till they have rocked to their basis, and tottered to their fall?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>It is the order, or rather the mass of vicious ignorance and poverty which has there accumulated for ages.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>This maniac power must continue to work its extended desolations in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, except so far as it may be enervated by <pb id="p.262" n="262"/>expanding on the wilderness of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>It is fortunate for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that this enfeebling process is rapidly going forward; but it is most unfortunate for us that we are destined soon to concentrate a power which <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is so happily expanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>We are destined, ere long, to become a great manufacturing, as well as commercial and agricultural people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>Our condition is soon to condense <num value="1000000">millions</num> into cities and manufacturing districts, where, as in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, from the class of population flowing in upon us, a distinct class of menial poverty will be formed, <quote>imbecile of mind, and inapt but for <num value="1">one</num> employment.</quote>

<p>Some years ago, a pamphlet fell into my hands, written by some <num value="1">one</num> whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>But reasoning from the past, or from well-established principles of political economy, it is morally certain that our present population of <num value="23000000">twenty-three millions</num> will then have swelled to near <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num>. <quote>Agriculture, commerce, and manufactures will have expanded their resources <pb id="p.263" n="263"/>and powers of production to an inconceivable extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>The various portions of our country will be linked together by railroads, canals,</quote> telegraphic wires and by some other--<name n="God" type="God">God</name> knows what!--as yet undiscovered means of connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>Already, the cities of our <placeName reg="Atlantic coast">Atlantic coast</placeName> converse freely, by means of <quote>lightning post-boys,</quote> with their next-door neighbors &mdash; the cities of the great <placeName reg="Mississippi valley">Mississippi valley</placeName>! <quote>Flourishing cities are now lifting their spires in the hitherto pathless wilds of <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName>, <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>,</quote> and <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, and will soon be in telegraphic connection with those of the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>Can any man doubt the political and commercial changes that will then follow throughout the civilized world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>But who can estimate the extent of these changes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>Already the walls of pagan <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName> have bowed to the thunder of <name>British</name> cannon, and the deep foundations of her ancient government are destined at no distant day to yield alike to American enterprise and American liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of her perishing population &mdash; indeed, already they come!--shall, ere long, flow in from the <rs>West</rs>, and meet the vast tide of papal superstition and vice that has been long setting in from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> on the east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>I am free to own that I contemplate this period with profound amazement!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>I know not the extent of the vision that confounds me. And when I turn my eyes to the canvas of Divine inspiration, and decipher its unerring pencillings, I cannot doubt that the strange elements that even now are so rapidly combining, and that are soon to concentrate the maddened powers of pagan ignorance, and papal superstition and vice, in the heart of this republic, are, ere long, to make my native land the great <pb id="p.265" n="265"/>theatre of those eventful battles &mdash; the conflicts of truth and error in both politics and religion &mdash; so graphically described in the apocalyptic vision of <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>And as I believe in the truth of the prophecy, and confide in the promise of Heaven, I cannot doubt the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>But mark you, <quote>the peril of our condition &mdash; the peril of that state of things on which our children may be but just entering!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>This conflict is to be the more or less fierce, the more or less disastrous to those who shall immediately sustain its calamities, as they shall be the more or less prepared for it. And what are the great agencies that shall prepare us for a successful conflict?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>What is it that shall give comparative mildness to this great moral and perhaps physical conflict that awaits our children, or the want of which shall arm it with all the terrors of a barbarous warfare?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>But <num value="1">one</num> answer can be given to these questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>The general education of the sovereigns of the land, and the conservative influence of our institutions, or perdition, is the alternative.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Upon the importance of the great educational movement of the country, I need not remark just now; nor need we notice in this connection the conservative influence of our free institutions, or rather the tendency of the great principle of liberty, (as embodied in our civil and religious institutions,) <pb id="p.266" n="266"/>which, with all true <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0062.0012.00266.00143" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, is a kind of instinctive belief, to diffuse itself through the mass of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>The <num value="2">two</num> together may justly be regarded as forming a bulwark of American liberty, upon which the intelligent mind of the country may repose with great confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>But still, history scarcely leaves us room to doubt that a <hi rend="italics">politico</hi>-religious priesthood, firmly established in the superstitious devotions of a strong minority even of <hi rend="italics">menials</hi>, who at the same time are political sovereigns, presents fearful odds in the strife of principles with the <quote>man of sin.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Nor need we be surprised at this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>A large mass of our population &mdash; however they may constitute but a minority of the whole population &mdash; have been educated from their cradles in the firm belief that it is a sin, involving the damnation of the soul, to read <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> word, or to exercise private judgment upon any matters which such a priesthood may choose to affirm are taught therein, and who are equally established in a superstitious opinion and feeling of devotion and submission, not only to its right to decide all such matters, but also its authority to punish with the highest spiritual torments all who shall heretically disregard its decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>This power has proved itself an overmatch for the genius of liberty in the states of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>Thrones and kingdoms have fallen before it. To this day the despots of <pb id="p.267" n="267"/><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> hold their sceptres in virtue of a league with it. <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n0062.0012.00267.00144" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> exercises despotic sway over a large portion of as free a people in their opinions and sentiments on all subjects without the range of priestly dictation and dogmatism as can be found on the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>But how does he do it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>He crushed the measures of liberty in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, and restored the <rs>Pope</rs> to his throne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>And why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>Not only because a republic in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> would be a dangerous neighbor, but also because he needed the authority of the priesthood to enforce the politico-religious dogmas upon which alone his despotic throne could repose with safety!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>Thus a large community who are among the most enlightened and devoted friends of liberty, are ruled by a grinding despotism; and this is only an instance in which the genius of liberty is crushed and trodden under foot by the man of sin. <quote>Education and the genius of liberty have done much in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and are daily struggling against fearful odds; and may do much more in this country to modify and restrain this power, but they are impotent to its destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>It is, in itself, so entirely contradictory of all liberty, and at the same time so full of vitality, that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in mercy has only relieved the despair of the world by the assurance that he would destroy it. Thus <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0062.0012.00267.00145" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> says:</quote> <hi rend="italics">The man of sin, who opposeth and</hi> <pb id="p.268" n="268"/><hi rend="italics">exalteth himself above all that is called <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, or that is worshipped; so that he, as <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, sitteth in the temple of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, showing himself that he is <name n="God" type="God">God</name></hi>--whom the <rs>Lord</rs> shall Consume with the spirit of his Mouth, and shall destroy with the <name>Brightness</name> of his coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/><quote><num value="2">2</num> Thess. <num value="2">II</num>. <num value="1">1</num>-<num value="12">12</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>The world has no hope of relief from the oppression of this nightmare of superstition, but that which is found in <hi rend="italics">this</hi> promise of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that the word of his truth shall overthrow and utterly destroy this monster power, which for so many ages has been the terror and the scourge of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>The <rs type="document">Bible</rs>--the word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>--freely circulated, read, and expounded, and freely judged of by all who read or hear, according to the dictates of their own judgments and consciences &mdash; this is the religion of Protestants!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>in exact antagonism to the teachings of the <hi rend="italics">man of sin</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>The triumph of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> is the overthrow of his power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>Now, the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> is not only being circulated, and its truths enforced from the pulpit, but a great many arrangements of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> are in constant operation, not only to secure the prevalence of Bible truths in our land, but also to place these truths in such circumstances as shall secure the permanent establishment of civil and religious liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>Of these arrangements of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, we may select as germane to the general <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>subject of discussion, the <hi rend="italics">conservative influence of the system of domestic slavery</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>That providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, by which so large a number of the <name>States</name> of this Union have been supplied with a population who cannot be absorbed by the body politic, but must exist among us, and for so long a time, in a distinct and menial position, provided the means of safety to the whole Union in the coming conflict which is already awakening the fears of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>If we do not greatly mistake the signs of the times, it is to these States that all eyes and all hopes will be turned as the great bulwarks of American liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> race in these States will give them this advantage of position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>Review the facts of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>As to that class of population coming into the country with that liberty of choice which intelligence and pecuniary means afford them, the whole land is before them, and few are more welcome than they, whatever may be their errors in religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>But relatively, they make but a small portion of the whole number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>The great mass of this coming population necessarily seek the <hi rend="italics">menial</hi> offices of society as the only means of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>This evil is already sorely felt in some portions of our country; and as our unoccupied lands shall be filled up by Western as well as Eastern immigration, this will <pb id="p.270" n="270"/>be still more generally and deeply felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>For all these are absorbed by the body politic, and form a part of the sovereignty of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>But what portion of our country is it which now suffers, and is chiefly threatened in future with this heavy calamity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>Not the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>This is evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>Our menial offices are already occupied by a race which cannot be absorbed, and who therefore can never form a part of the sovereignty of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>Hence, there is no room for the menials of either <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> or <placeName reg="Zhonghua" key="tgn,1000111">China</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>The door of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> is closed against their admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>The foreign population which finds its way into the <rs>South</rs> are, for the most part, a valued and welcome class of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>No: it is in the midst of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and those new States which repudiate the <name>African</name> race, that these shoals of vice, superstition, and ignorance &mdash; these hordes of modern Canaanites &mdash; are gathering, <quote>thick as the frogs and flies of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Upon these States, and not upon the <rs>South</rs>, this great and increasing calamity is to display its strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>Are they destined to control the <hi rend="italics">primary</hi> schools to a great extent, from which they exclude the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, and educate a large mass of the population to abandon the inherent right of private judgment on all matters which the priesthood may please to define &mdash; whether correctly or not &mdash; as matters of religion: <pb id="p.271" n="271"/>that is, to abandon those rights of conscience which are guaranteed to every citizen by the constitution of our country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>Already, many of these schools are thus controlled, and a large portion of the citizens are thus being educated in the city and <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>, and other places <num value="1">1</num> But nothing of this sort can exist to any extent in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>So far as popular education is promoted in these States, it must be strictly Protestant education &mdash; Protestant, at least, in its main feature: that is, every citizen brought up among us grows up in the educated belief that, whatever aid he may seek or derive from a gospel ministry, he is still individually and personally responsible to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and his country, for his opinions and his practices, both as to politics and religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>He should, therefore, read, reflect, and judge for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>No <quote>man of sin,</quote> in the shape of pope, <rs type="role" n="Bishop">bishop</rs>, priest, minister, or preacher of the gospel, or with any other title, has authority to <quote><hi rend="italics">oppose and exalt himself above all that is called <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, or that is worshipped</hi>,</quote> by dispensing either political or religious beliefs; <quote><hi rend="italics">so that he, as <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, sitteth in the temple of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, showing himself that he is <name n="God" type="God">God</name></hi>:</quote> enforcing his right to control the consciences of men, by severe spiritual and temporal penalties &mdash; reaching even to <quote><hi rend="italics">anathema maranatha</hi>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>No material portion of Southern <pb id="p.272" n="272"/>sovereigns can ever grow up in such an utter abandonment of all liberty, whilst the <name>African</name> race shall fill the menial offices of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>All this, however, and perhaps much more, is reserved for those States which repudiate this race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>And still further, Is all this calculated to corrupt the purity of elections, as it has done in many sections of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>, and eminently so in the cities of New York and <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>?--and is this evil also destined to reach the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">national Legislature</orgName>, either directly, as the result of numerical strength, or indirectly, as the action of a powerful minority, holding the balance of power between contending political parties, and, in either case, sooner or later, seriously threatening if not precipitating evils upon the whole country, of which the oppressions of many of the <name>States</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> now furnish us the mournful examples!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>But no such influence can ever reach, to any material extent, the ballot-boxes of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>With an educated sovereignty, we have only to consummate our triumph over intemperance, and our elections are at once fair exponents of the will of an enlightened people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>Our people may err in opinion, but, always right in sentiment, and with no motive to stay wrong, they may, in due time, be put right in <hi rend="italics">opinion</hi> also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>The Southern States may be labored by the <pb id="p.273" n="273"/>tempests that shall break upon them from other sources, but not from this, which its history in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> shows to be the most terrible calamity that ever scourged humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>With their ships well trimmed and their sails well set, and both worked and governed by an educated sovereignty, it is morally impossible that they should founder in the open sea of free discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>These States, therefore, will remain, and shall ever remain, through all this fierce conflict, <hi rend="italics">free</hi> to settle the great quarrel of the country between light and darkness, between religion and a vile superstition!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>Upon these States will devolve the duty of holding the balance of power between these great contending forces, and of preserving the ark of American liberty in the politico-religious storms that are to sweep over the land, and shake the foundations of our confederacy.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>it has been shown in previous lectures that the principle of slavery accords fully with the doctrine of abstract rights, civil and social; and that a system of domestic slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is demanded by the circumstances of the <name>African</name> population in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>But it by no means follows that the conduct of all masters, in the exercise of their functions as masters, is proper, any <pb id="p.277" n="277"/>more than that the conduct of all parents, or the owners of apprentices, is such as it should be. The opinion is entertained that the domestic government of children does not more than approximate propriety as a general thing; and that the government of apprentices and of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slaves falls far short of what is proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>In this lecture it is proposed to deal with the relations of masters to slaves, that is, the duties they owe them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>The doctrine that the system of domestic slavery assumes that the slave is a <quote>mere machine &mdash; a chattel,</quote> has been fully exploded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>The <rs type="document">Bible</rs> particularly regards the slave an accountable being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>It requires him to yield a willing obedience to his master, and teaches him that such service is accepted of the <rs>Lord</rs> as service done unto himself, Ephesians <num value="6">VI</num>. <num value="5">5</num>-<num value="8">8</num>; and in the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> verse, the master is required to <quote>do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>And again, (Colossians <num value="4">IV</num>. <num value="1">1</num>,) <quote>Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>Hence, in the strictest sense, religion holds the scales of justice between masters and slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Each <num value="1">one</num> is held to a strict accountability for the faithful performance of his duty, the <num value="1">one</num> to the other--<quote>for there is no respect of persons with <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>It behooves us, then, who are masters, or who <pb id="p.278" n="278"/>expect to become masters, to inquire into the duties of this relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>The master who does not inform himself on this subject, and endeavor conscientiously to do his duty, is strangely wanting in important elements of <name>Christian</name> character, and, indeed, even in some of those attributes which enter materially into the character of a good citizen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>A most fanatical spirit is abroad in the land on the subject of domestic slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>The inhumanity of masters at the <rs>South</rs> is greatly exaggerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>(Instances in which the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> is abused no doubt contribute to this excitement.) Even those who are deficient in the duties they owe their domestics and apprentices &mdash; quite as much so as is common at the <rs>South</rs> with the masters of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slaves &mdash; lend a willing ear to political demagogues and fanatical party-leaders in their denunciations of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>Want of sympathy for hired servants, aid instances in which they are overreached and oppressed beyond the means of legal redress, are as common in certain quarters as are the cases of inhumanity to the slaves at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>But this does not help the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>Evils of this kind are to be deplored whether they occur at the <rs>North</rs> or the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>The injunction of the apostle reaches every case of the kind--<quote>Masters, give unto your servants <pb id="p.279" n="279"/>that which is just and equal: knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>But what may the apostle mean by this precept?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>The view before taken of the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> will justify a departure from the usual line of thought on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>To give any <num value="1">one</num> that which is <hi rend="italics">just</hi> is to confer upon him that which is his right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>To give that which is just and equal, is a form of expression that may limit the term <quote>just</quote> to its legal sense, that is, confer on him all the rights guaranteed to him by law. There is a special necessity for this command in any state of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>For whatever advantages the law might confer on the slave, his subordinate relation, and the superior position and authority of the master, will of necessity place it in his power to defeat the provisions of the law in favor of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>But the command goes farther than this: Give unto your servants that which is <hi rend="italics">equal, equitable</hi>, that is, justice in a moral sense, or that which is <hi rend="italics">right</hi>--good in itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>Whatever provision the law might make for the benefit of the slave, as a slave, might be secured to him by his master, and yet many of his natural and acquired rights might be overlooked, and the claims of <name>Christian</name> charity annulled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>To fulfil the command, however, we must give the slave <hi rend="italics">equity</hi>, as well as legal justice: we must do unto the slave what we would have the slave to do <pb id="p.280" n="280"/>unto us, on a change of relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>It is needless to repeat the discussion of this topic in a former lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>Suffice it to say, that the master is not required to give to his slave (any more than the parent is required to give to his child) whatever he might wish, but whatever justice and equity claim for him, that is, whatever is right or good in itself; or, if you please, accord to him all his natural and acquired rights, as a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>For this is precisely that, and no more, to which the master would be entitled on a change of relations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>We now meet the question-What are the rights of the slave?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>The duties of the master are reciprocal of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>Those who believe, witt <persName n="Channing,,,,," id="n0062.0013.00280.00149" reg="mostcommon:Channing,nomatch:0"><surname>Channing</surname></persName>, that the relation they sustain as masters assumes that their slaves have no rights, we may consider are beyond the reach of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>If the master owes any duties to his slave, it is because the rights of the slave entitle him to the benefit of the faithful performance of these duties on the part of his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>No point is more fully settled in Scripture than this: masters are held to a strict accountability to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the faithful performance of certain duties to their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>The <rs type="document">Bible</rs> puts it beyond all dispute that <quote>the master stands to his bond-servant, <num value="1">one</num> bought with his money or born in his house, in a relation widely different from that which he sustains to the hired <pb id="p.281" n="281"/>servant, or the stranger within his gates, or the neighbor without them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>And as he may be a good neighbor, and yet at fault as a husband and father, so he may be a good husband, a good father, and yet a bad master.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>The duties which the master owes the slave are as binding on the conscience as those which the slave owes the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>To neglect either involves the party so neglecting in sin. Indeed, the duties of the master are as binding as those of any relation in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>On many accounts, they are peculiarly solemn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>They are duties owed to inferiors, and inferiors in a helpless condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>They appeal to the magnanimity of the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>He who disregards this appeal, not only violates duty, but betrays a want of magnanimity, bordering upon that meanness of spirit which delights to oppress an inferior, whilst it cowers before an equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>A brave man is always magnanimous, and a magnanimous man will rarely fail to respect the rights of the helpless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/><hi rend="italics">Guardianship</hi>, as well as authority, enters as an element into the idea of master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>Masters are not only rulers, but protectors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>If the servant is defrauded of his own, if his wants are not regarded and his grievances redressed, or he is otherwise oppressed, to whom can he complain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>True, his miseries are not voiceless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>His cries <quote>enter into the ears of the <pb id="p.282" n="282"/><rs type="role" reg="Lord">Lord</rs> of sabaoth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>But his only earthly appeal lies to his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>He has permitted or done this thing, and it is laid upon the conscience of the slave to submit, <quote>not answering again.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>His master is his only earthly protector.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>His guaranty that his master will protect him, is that he too has a <quote>Master in heaven,</quote> who is no respecter of persons, and that to him belongeth vengeance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>According to principles established in the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> and <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> lectures, the <name>Africans</name> of this country, in common with minors, imbeciles, and uncivilized persons, have a right to be governed and protected, and to such means of physical comfort and moral improvement as are necessary and compatible with their providential condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>That which it is their right to have as slaves, it is the duty of masters to secure to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>Superior positions devolve higher and more important duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>The master who ignores these claims, and affects to be offended with any who may assert them on behalf of the slave, will do well to consider that the <quote>cries of those who have reaped down their fields,</quote> that is, the claims of those who have labored for them, and have no earthly friend to vindicate their rights, are heard by Him who has said, Vengeance is mine: <quote>I will repay, saith the <rs>Lord</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>But <name>Christian</name> masters, or even men of religious sentiments, who always respect the <pb id="p.283" n="283"/>claims of the poor, find pleasure in attending to the wants of the helpless, and to none more than those of their own slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>Humanity, the claims of religion, and the pecuniary interest of the master, all unite to enforce the claims of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>The physical and the moral man are so nicely blended, and the duties we owe the <num value="1">one</num> run so naturally into those we owe the other, that it is difficult to make a well-defined classification, especially in the case of either slaves or children.

Instances are to be found in which ignorance with a natural tendency to idleness, or vast wealth, joined with a kind of sentimental religion, which exhausts itself in a morbid sympathy for the poor, leads to a disregard of that great law of nature under which slaves should be subjected to labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>Many are indulged in idleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>Idleness is a crime in any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>Even those whose wealth and social position in society enable them to indulge in idleness without incurring the ordinary penalties, inflict a great evil upon society thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>And for those who can only be occupied in the menial offices of society to be indulged in idleness is to create a nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>There are families in the <rs>Southern</rs> country whose slaves can only be regarded as nuisances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>Sometimes the ignorance, but more frequently the dissipated habits of the master, lead to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>Again, in some cases, widows with large fortunes in slaves furnish examples of the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>They are not generally in circumstances to manage a farm, without the aid of an intelligent and judicious steward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>But a morbid sympathy, joined, perhaps, with parsimony, prevents the employment of such a <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>The consequence is, the slaves are indulged in <pb id="p.285" n="285"/>great idleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>Families are sometimes broken up from these causes, and the slaves sold under the hammer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>The separation of family ties, which under given circumstances is a cause for so much regret, is often to be traced to these sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>But long before this result, the slaves are considered and felt to be a nuisance in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>Many intelligent and humane neighbors, who deplore the dissolution of the family and the separations consequent upon it, are bound to admit that these disasters after all are the least of evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>Hence, slaves should be subjected to physical labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>The slaves on these prosperous farms, although they are made to observe great constancy and system in their labor, are not subjected to the same amount of hard labor as are those of many less thrifty farmers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>This is a general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>Some do with less: a few require more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>But in every case there is a limit beyond which we cannot habitually go, without the sacrifice of health or life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>The constitutions of some laboring men can bear a great loss of sleep; but it is on the same principle that a few constitutions can, for a long time, resist the effects of the daily use of alcohol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>We unyoke the ox, we stable the horse, and the whole night is devoted to their repose,.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>I say <quote>reposes,</quote> for sleep is not all that is required for rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>There is a time of leisure, a waking repose, which is as necessary as sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>No reasonable <pb id="p.290" n="290"/>man denies himself the benefit of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>The slave is entitled to the early part of the night for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>There is the refreshment of mind resulting from repose from ordinary pursuits, and occupation with things which may please the humor or minister to innocent gratification, by which, to a certain degree, the exhausted system is restored as much as by sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>The slave, like his master, is entitled to the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>What if he do employ a reasonable part of it to turn a penny, and in arranging for his personal comfort?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>It gives repose to his mind: it ministers to his cheerfulness: along with sleep it reinvigorates his whole system, and makes him a more valuable as well as a more happy servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>Who, then, shall deny him the boon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>Surely not the economist, who calls him his <quote>money,</quote> and who, by any <pb id="p.291" n="291"/>other course, would be reducing the value of <quote>his money</quote> below par</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>A clear evidence of the economy of this system is afforded by the striking contrast which in some cases is to be found on plantations between slaves thus treated, and masters of a certain description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>The slaves are fat, sleek, cheerful, and long-lived: spending their leisure time in cheerful conversation, in singing, or in those little personal offices which give elasticity to mind and body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>But not so with some masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>They sleep as much &mdash; that is, lie down as much &mdash; as their slaves; but their sleep is disturbed by an incoherent tracing of the anxious thoughts of the troubled day. They are not refreshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>Both mind and body are worn down by excessive friction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>They hasten to premature old age; and the weary wheels of life stand still long before the appointed time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>Some masters are personally very industrious and enterprising: they work side by side with their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>It is their boast that they require no more of their slaves than they do themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>Yea, they do more than they, having the direction and care of <pb id="p.292" n="292"/>all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>Surely, say they, my slaves have no right to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>But this reasoning is not always fair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>It may be that the master overtasks him self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>This does not give the right to overtask his slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>Withal, he brings to his task a physical system stimulated to a high degree by those mental activities which push him forward to enterprise great things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>He labors to exhaustion and enjoys his rest only the more for having done so. Not so with the slave who works by his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>When he yields to over-fatigue, his thoughts administer <num value="110">110</num> cordial to his weary limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>The head of the family should not only do this himself, but see that all his household observe the <name>Sabbath</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>It is not enough that the children and servants be left free to keep the <name>Sabbath</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>The head of the family should see that all the arrangements necessary to promote the due observance of the <name>Sabbath</name> are properly made, so that, whilst he requires the observance of the <name>Sabbath</name>, all the domestic arrangements invite to its observance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>There are certain individuals about many families <pb id="p.293" n="293"/>whose offices are so difficult to be dispensed with, because they are so necessary to self-indulgence, that they are often deprived of the rest of the <name>Sabbath</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>Of this class there are <num value="2">two</num> humble but very important personages, which it is neither beneath the subject nor the occasion to notice, namely, the cook and the carriage-driver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>To the carriage-driver of some families, all days are alike <quote>days of rest.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>He is the most idle personage about the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>It is well if a farm-hand be not presently sold to support his idleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>But the carriage-driver of another family.is himself also a farm-hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>With him the case may be widely different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>He may toil on the farm <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> in the week, and spend the day of rest in burnishing harness, and with carriage and horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>If he drive to church, the care of his horses is at least a pretext for neglecting the sermon; and if he drive to spend the day with a neighbor, it is not a day of rest, and may not be a day of enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>In either case, there is but little companionship, but few church privileges, and still less opportunity for rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>It may be no better with the cook, and is often not so well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>Indeed, the <name>Sabbath</name> is seldom a day of rest with the cook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>It is oftener a day of much closer confinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>Stewing, roasting, baking, and broiling the greater part of the day on Sabbath, afford but little time for the <pb id="p.294" n="294"/>repose for which the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> commandment provides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2158"/>These are evils in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>It lies on right-minded men to correct them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>On the principle of good economy, slaves are entitled to habitations sufficiently airy and cool in summer, close and warm in winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>And as it costs no more, why may not their houses be located with due regard to their health, their convenience, and comfort?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>Let them then be grouped together on the gentle slope of a hill, and, as lime is cheap, let them all be neatly whitewashed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2165"/>Who could object to a little garden spot attached to each?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2166"/>And why may there not be nice rows of shade trees, and neat grass-plots upon which the children can sport, and where the men and women can sit and enjoy a delightful Sabbath evening?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2167"/>Economy will not object to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2168"/>The miserable smoky hovels in low damp situations, black and disagreeable to the sight, in which, in some instances, they are huddled together, cannot be too severely condemned on the principles of economy, no less than on those of good morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2169"/>For if the inhabitants <pb id="p.295" n="295"/>of such buildings are not filthy, degraded, and thievish to an extent that materially depreciates their value, it can only be because they are extraordinary examples of moral purity.</p>

All those families whose self-respect leads them to regard their position in society, supply their slaves with comfortable clothing, and pay particular attention to the neatness as well as the comfort of those kept about the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2171"/>It would indicate a very low state of civilization, if these things should be generally neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2172"/>The improvements in the manufacture of cotton, wool, and leather have been so great that nothing short of these could be tolerated in decent society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2173"/>Our slaves are no doubt generally better fed, clothed, and housed than are the menials in most of the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2174"/>Still, there are instances of neglect, which should be noticed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2175"/>Those who pay but little attention to their habitations, generally neglect their clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2176"/>Feet are to be found unshod when frost is on the ground; the head uncovered in all weathers; and the body far from being suitably protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2177"/>The color and tropical habitudes of our slaves render them peculiarly liable to suffer from cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2178"/>Health as well as comfort requires them to be warmly clad in cold weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2179"/><quote>A shivering servant is a shame to any master.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2180"/>It <pb id="p.296" n="296"/>is economy to sell a slave occasionally rather than let all suffer for the want of clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2181"/>But they should also be supplied with suitable beds and bedding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2182"/>The expense is really so trifling, and the economy so great, that masters entitled to respect cannot be excused for the neglect of this duty <persName n="Shucks,,,,," id="n0062.0013.00296.00150" reg="mostcommon:Shucks,nomatch:0"><surname>Shucks</surname></persName> are plentiful on all farms, and cotton is abundant on many, and can be easily had at cheap rates on those on which it is not raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2183"/>These articles make excellent mattresses, and the latter makes most excellent comforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2184"/>Those rainy days on which slaves should not be allowed to work out, should be employed in providing these articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2185"/>Health and life are often thus preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2186"/>To allow slaves to labor in filth and rags through the week, and lie about or stroll about on the <name>Sabbath</name> in their unwashed rags, should be severely censured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2187"/>It does not help the matter a great deal to throw them a thin blanket occasionally, with liberty to take repose wherever they can find it. Such masters pay more in doctors' bills than it would cost to make their slaves as comfortable as those of their more prudent neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2188"/>It is a shame to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2191"/>A sufficient quantity of good substantial food, well prepared, should be furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/>Meat should form a fair proportion of the diet of a laboring <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2193"/>The <rs>Irish</rs>, it is true, eat but little meat, and do well,--that is, such as do not perish,--but the <name>African</name> constitution in this climate requires meat, and they must have it if they do full labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2194"/>Their food should be well prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2195"/>To secure this, it should be prepared by a cook, and eaten at a common table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>To put laboring farm-hands off with an allowance of meat and meal, to prepare it or seek its preparation as they may, is too obviously wrong to require argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>The force of habit is exceedingly stubborn in the <name>African</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>To eat a piece of meat exhausted of its nutriment by being crisped on the coals, is very much to the taste of those accustomed to it: they will yield with great reluctance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>But still, this plan should give place to the better preparation of the public table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>An excellent habit of the slaves is to eat slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>Usually something like <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> in the long days s allowed them to eat and refresh themselves at <time value="12pm">noon</time>. It is not too much to allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>The early roasting ear, the ripe fruit, the melons, the potatoes, the <pb id="p.298" n="298"/>fat stock, all enter of right in due season and limited proportions into their bill of fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>Better do all this than pay doctors' bills, or tempt them to steal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>Nor do I fall out with the custom of some of our better families, to supply their tables with a portion of all the delicacies of the <quote>great house,</quote> on particular occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>Some may think this too much for slaves!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>But the attachment of Southern slaves to the families in which they were born and brought up is proverbial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>And let Northern fanatics believe and prate what they will, it is still true that the practical workings of the system generally, on the basis of the duties here inculcated, is in a good degree the cause of this attachment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>Every right-minded master contemplates the <hi rend="italics">physique</hi> of his servants with emotions of pride and pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>Their looks reflect his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>A gang of half-starved, meanlyclad, overworked slaves, with no heart to laugh or sing, and even without that attachment for their owners which the ox and the ass have for theirs, is a disgusting spectacle, and as revolting to every feeling of humanity as it is in violation of every principle of economy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/><num value="5">5</num>. <hi rend="italics">Provision should be made for slaves in times of sickness</hi>. Each of the topics discussed derives much of its importance from its connection with this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>Reasonable labor, time for repose and sleep, <pb id="p.299" n="299"/>habitations, clothing, and food, are each and all of them provisions against the occurrence of sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>Still, the topic deserves a more special notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>All families should have such domestic provisions as anticipate sickness by suitable arrangements for it when it comes &mdash; such as comfortable apartments and the ordinary conveniences for nursing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>All families and manufactories employing a sufficient number of slaves to require it) should have a hospital: that is, a house so situated as to location and internal arrangements as to be a convenient and comfortable place for the sick, and equally convenient to those who may have to nurse the sick or to overlook those who do. The economy of such an arrangement on large farms commends itself to approbation So far front encouraging a well-known disposition among slaves of a certain character to lie by for trifling causes, it will contribute very much to discourage such habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>If slaves are permitted to lounge about their own houses when sick, they may often elude observation, and spend their time in idleness, when they should be at work; and in cases of actual silliness, they are liable to suffer for want of attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>On the hospital plan, the case will be very different with each of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>If all who are sick have to go to the hospital, and take physic, the former will not be so likely to feign <pb id="p.300" n="300"/>sickness, and the really sick will be better attended to.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>Some masters obviate the necessity for a portion of this, by cultivating a part of the crop, and dividing the proceeds of its sale among them for their exclusive benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>None but a tyrant, who is always a bad economist, will disregard their claims to what is known as their own time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>Any other man who should attempt it, would soon be taught to feel that the force of public opinion, even among slaves, well sustained as it is on these points, is a matter not to be despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>The claims of slaves and the rights of the public coincide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>Plantation slaves who may be no less than a body of ragamuffins, carrying on petty depredations upon the rights of property in the neighborhood, are a serious <pb id="p.301" n="301"/>nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>Some employ them that they may with less loss indulge in idleness: others, because they distrust their own experience in farming; and others again, because more important duties put it out of their power to give the necessary personal attention to their farms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>But whether from the <num value="1">one</num> cause or the other, the master owes certain duties to his slave as well as to himself in selecting an individual to take his place over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>Economically considered, the rights of the slave and the interests of the master coincide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>Many overlook this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>An industrious but heartless business man may be found to act as steward, who, with an interest in the crop, will stir late and early, and drive hard all the day; but the great laws which regulate the <pb id="p.302" n="302"/>reciprocal operations of labor, sleep, and repose will be strangely disregarded by such a man. He may succeed in a crop for a year, perhaps for a series of years; but the value of the personal property as well as of the lands will be annually depreciating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>There is no economy in employing an agent of this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>A plantation is an empire within itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>If the territory be large, and the subjects numerous, the mind that presides, whether as master or steward, must be competent to direct a proper division of labor, and to govern on the principles of justice and equity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>It is only the income from such estates that will justify the employment of the best talents, for these will always command high prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>Though industrious, he need not be cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>Industry, good moral habits, and common sense, are essential qualities in an overseer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>To be himself immoral, and to contribute to corrupt the <pb id="p.303" n="303"/>morals of those under him, involves the master who employs him in the guilt of sin, as well as depreciates the value of his property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>The civil government assumes that the pecuniary interest of the master and the duty which he owes his slaves coincide so perfectly, that the performance of certain duties may with propriety be left to him. He is the patriarch of his whole house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>He commands the time and labor of his children and his slaves &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> for a definite period in life, the other for an indefinite period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>He gives law to the <num value="1">one</num> and to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>So long as he does not violate the constitution and laws of the political commonwealth of which he is himself a subject, his authority is absolute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>All the rights of his children and his servants appeal to him. He is responsible to the civil government not to violate its provisions, and he is responsible to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the faithful performance of his duties to his children and his servants; for the sin of omitting to do <pb id="p.305" n="305"/>his duty to his children or servants could rarely be reached by the civil authority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>The duty of the master to his slaves as social beings is to give them laws within the limits prescribed by the civil government, and to govern them according to the principles of justice and equity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>As his empire is constantly under his eye, or the eye of his immediate agent, it is not necessary that he have recourse to a code of laws definitely drawn up and formally announced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>As the teacher in his room, and the mother in her nursery, may have their rules, and have them obeyed without these formalities, so may the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>But these rules should not relate merely to the economical use of the slave's time and labor, but should be adapted to his character as a social being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>Hence, it is not proposed to give a code of laws for the plantation, but to discuss certain principles which should influence the conduct of the master in the government of his domestic empire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/><num value="1">1</num>. <hi rend="italics">In regard to punishments</hi>. Neither the magistrate, the parent, nor the master, should bear the sword in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>Disobedience, which, in all wise governments, is wickedness, must be restrained, and in extreme cases by severe punishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>It would be great weakness to forbear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>But <num value="1">one</num> law, however, should govern in the infliction <pb id="p.306" n="306"/>of punishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>They should be inflicted for the purpose of correction, or as <quote>a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well,</quote> and not to gratify passion or resentment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>Punishments inflicted from motives of resentment merely, and often repeated, tend directly to cow the spirit, stultify the intellect, destroy self-respect, and greatly weaken the power of arbitrary volition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>Such a man approximates the nature of a brute and is, in fact, scarcely of the value of a common horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>He is a human being, but in circumstances in which he has few motives of action above those which influence a brute &mdash; namely, the indulgence of his animal nature, restrained only by the fear of present punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>He is not as serviceable as a brute, and is far more dangerous than a brute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>A slave to whose sense of what is right and proper to be done nothing can be trusted, and from whom nothing can be gotten but that which is extorted from his fears, is of no value unless it be to a master of the same genus &mdash; that is, like himself, a brute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>The prodigality as well as wickedness of this course requires no comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>There is a more excellent way of maintaining authority, and it lies upon the conscience of every master no less than upon his purse to observe it as a duty: it is <hi rend="italics">to punish for the purpose of correction only &mdash; not to destroy, but to save</hi>. <pb id="p.307" n="307"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>Punishments can only be salutary as a means of moral discipline in the measure in which they produce shame and mortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>But <num value="1">one</num> who has no self-respect can have no shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>The effect of punishment in such a case is lost only so far as it may help to brutalize him. A desire to secure the favor and preserve the confidence of those upon whom we are dependent is the highest guaranty for faithfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>But he only who respects himself will value the respect and confidence of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>And it is difficult for any man to retain his self-respect when he knows that no <num value="1">one</num> respects him. It is not impossible to be done; but only men of great moral firmness and conscious integrity succeed in doing it. We have no right to expect it from slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>They universally concede the superior intelligence of the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>And for <num value="1">one</num> of these, accustomed from early childhood to hear himself disparaged in company, and degraded by harsh epithets for his stupidity and disobedience by those whom he thinks to be superior in every thing, to grow up with the necessary self-respect, is not to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>It would be singular, indeed, even if <num value="1">one</num> who had been better brought up should be able to retain his self-respect under this kind of treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>And without self-respect, punishment can have no moral effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>Why then should we thus sin against <name n="God" type="God">God</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>How <pb id="p.308" n="308"/>much better to regard the counsel of <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0062.0013.00308.00155" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>: <quote><hi rend="italics">And ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>We sometimes meet with these remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>There is often a great deal of reason for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>Our slaves have many faults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>They are ignorant, careless, slothful, and sometimes perverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>These things are at all times vexatious, and sometimes a great temptation to sin. But then it should not be forgotten that our children sometimes give us <pb id="p.309" n="309"/>more trouble, and furnish stronger temptations to sin, than our slaves could possibly do. Having all the perverseness of the slave, their superior intelligence may make them much more potent for evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>But still they are our children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>The wisest and best parents will have to be blind to a great many faults, and ultimately bear in silence with a great deal which cannot be concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>The parent that does his best, and commits results to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, will find in the end that things turn out a great deal better than his fears dictated they would do. So our slaves are ours still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>They are <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> poor, committed to us. We must control and protect them for their profit, as well as work them for our mutual profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>They have great faults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>Still, they are our heritage both for good and for evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>We may not dissolve the relation between us and them, any more than that between us and our children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>We dare not turn them loose in the savage wilds of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, any more than we dare allow them to be hunted down as wild beasts by the advances of a superior race, with whom they cannot be permitted to amalgamate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>To govern as well as work them, is, then, a moral necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>We cannot fulfil our duty without perhaps a great deal of trouble in given cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>At all times we must be blind to many faults, and bear with some others which cannot be concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>There is no release from <pb id="p.310" n="310"/>this war. Penalties, severe penalties must be inflicted occasionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>Every steady government will sometimes have to wield authority with a strong hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>This is a source of trouble to all, and often of great pain to good people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>Still, there are views to be taken of the condition of the <name>African</name> which go far to relieve the whole subject of its difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>Many of those faults which are sources of so much annoyance are to be traced to <hi rend="italics">ignorance</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">want of self-respect</hi>, and these are oftentimes their infirmities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>They are by nature slow to learn, and hence their ignorance; and few perhaps have taken pains to cultivate in them much self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>Do not these facts plead in their behalf?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>Again, what master who desires to do justly can be wholly indifferent to their good qualities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>For a more docile and kind-hearted race of people are not to be found than the <name>Africans</name> of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>Readiness to forgive, gratitude in their rude notions of it, hospitality to strangers, and affection for friends, are characteristics of the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>Cases of ingratitude and resentment are the exceptions, not the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>Confide, then, in your slaves, as far as these qualities will allow you to do it. They will not disappoint your confidence, as seriously, at least, as many others with the same opportunities would probably do it. Give attention to their comfort in little things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>This will not cost you <pb id="p.311" n="311"/>much, and will show your care for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>Pay due respect to their feelings and their reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>This may cost you no more than a pleasant look or a kind word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>Never be backward under proper circumstances to trust them in any thing in which it is proper to trust persons in a menial position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>This course will not be without its effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>Confidence will beget confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>For <num value="1">one</num> to be respected by others, goes far to beget respect in <num value="1">one</num>'s self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>With a reasonable degree of self-respect in the slave, and confidence in the kindness and justice of his master, his discipline cannot fail to be salutary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2336"/>He may punish in cases of disobedience with great firmness, and to a merited extent, and it will not fail to produce shame and mortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>His authority will be <quote>a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>The public opinion of his little commonwealth will fully sustain his administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>The counsels of age, the cutting jokes of early manhood, and the merry laugh of the young, will all unite to teach the offender a valuable lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>He who governs a plantation of slaves without the aid of a certain measure of public opinion, is a loser in the end. Some masters affect to despise this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>Brute force may sustain them; but the public opinion even of so humble a commonwealth as a plantation of slaves is not to be despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>The sensible and <pb id="p.312" n="312"/>humane master, who would obey the apostolic precept, and maintain a sound and judicious discipline among his slaves, will obey what is equally implied in another injunction, and entitle himself to the respect and confidence of his subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>Tyrants who have operated upon wider and nobler fields have affected to despise public opinion, and lost their crowns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>The petty tyrants of whom we treat cannot fail to lose the respect of their neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>It is impossible to respect a man whose policy infests the neighborhood with a band of freebooters, and this policy will rarely fail to reduce such a man to poverty also.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/><num value="2">2</num>. <hi rend="italics">In regard to the social principle</hi>. They are social beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>There are among them those great impulses of our nature, general love for society, and attachment to the sexes, out of which arise the affection of husband and wife, the love of parents to children, and children to parents, and all the various modifications of affection, resulting from collateral and more distant relationships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>Besides these, there is the feeling of friendship between individuals of similar habits and corresponding pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>All these social principles are common to our <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>Any evidence to the-contrary is only a proof of a low state of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>Now, it is an easy matter for some minds to overlook the fact that they are <hi rend="italics">social</hi> <pb id="p.313" n="313"/>and not <hi rend="italics">mere</hi> sentient beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>But all the elements of simple society are to be found among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>They associate together as other races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>It is not peculiar to them to wish to be together and to find pleasure in each other's society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>They obey the common law of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>These elements of the social nature give rise to various relations and duties among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>They do not operate mechanically, but morally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>Hence their society is subject to all the mutations, the conflict of rights and the violation of duties, of any other simple society, under like restrictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>As in any other society, these relations must be understood and made to operate within certain limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>These rights must be guarded and protected by the observance of certain duties enforced by certain penalties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>Otherwise they may herd together, as in the wilds of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>; but they cannot dwell together as rational beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>For the impulses of nature are not fulfilled when they are permitted merely to herd together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>At this point, the master owes an important duty to his slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>Its observance will greatly promote their progress in civilization, and enhance the value of his property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>He is their civil lawgiver, and the judge in all the grave controversies which arise among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>He should not be derelict in duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>He should not think it beneath him to arrest their broils by <pb id="p.314" n="314"/>authority, and settle their controversies by a kind of judicial decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>A sensible man will not content himself by saying: <quote>There were no bones broken: no <num value="1">one</num> was killed or crippled,</quote> or, <quote>A fine child is born.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>These are not the only things which concern his interest or his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>It is not doing as he would be done by. The civil government which protects him would not be worth a tithe of the taxes, if it concerned itself no further to protect his rights of property and his happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>His decisions, therefore, should regulate the relations of this society, should protect such rights of property as he allows among them, and enforce the observance of such contracts as he allows them to negotiate either among their own fellow-servants or those of another plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>At the same time that he sees that they keep themselves within the position which they hold in the great community of whites, in which they are subordinate members, he should see that they are not overborne and oppressed by their superiors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most important of all the social relations <hi rend="italics">is the marriage relation</hi>. The civil government has not thought it wise to interfere with this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>It leaves this to the control of the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2375"/>His interest and his duty afford a high guaranty that he will consult the interests of his slaves in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2376"/>He should encourage the young to <pb id="p.315" n="315"/>marry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>He should not only positively forbid the herding together in indiscriminate intercourse, but he should promote marriage by all suitable arrangements and influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>It is an important interest and duty with him to have his slaves suitably married and at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>He should not scruple to buy and to sell to effect proper marriages among the slaves of his own plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>And when this cannot be done, he should permit his slaves to intermarry with those of a neighboring plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>There should be in all cases separate apartments for families, and separate houses as soon as they can be provided.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>From causes which need not be enumerated, they are peculiarly addicted to licentious indulgences, and particularly disposed to violate the marriage-bed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2383"/>No master is at liberty to neglect or overlook these immoralities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>He should not allow any to marry without understanding the obligations of the relation, and he should enforce, as far as his discipline can reach the case, the obligations of the marriage-bed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>The custom of leaving <num value="1">one</num> wife and taking another, should be positively prohibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>Those masters whose policy actually makes this custom in a good degree necessary, cannot be too severely censured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>If slaves were mere chattels, as abolitionists affirm they are, there might be an apology <pb id="p.316" n="316"/>for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>But as it is, there is no apology for it. The custom of separating man and wife is the remnant of a barbarous age: any gentleman should be ashamed of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>No: the marriage relation must be maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>Indiscriminate intercourse should be restrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>Those masters whose policy renders this custom in a good degree necessary should revise their system, and they must revise their system unless they would continue to outrage the moral sense of their fellow-citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>For myself, I do not feel at liberty &mdash; and I speak as a citizen &mdash; to treat the marriage relation among slaves other than as a most sacred relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>Those marriages which are maintained in good faith, no master should feel himself at liberty to violate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>Nothing but conjugal infidelity or some capital offence which subjects the party offending to imprisonment for life, to banishment, or to death, can dissolve the marriage obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>I have said that the <name>Africans</name> are a kind and <pb id="p.317" n="317"/>docile race of people; but still it is true of them, as of all other barbarous people, that they have but little conception of moral influence as an element of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>Fear is the motive to which in all cases they appeal &mdash; and with the best intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>They have but little idea of any thing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>Whatever authority, therefore, is placed in their hands is likely to be exercised with great harshness, perhaps with cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>Many masters avail themselves of the services of an intelligent servant, and make him <quote>head-man,</quote> instead of incurring the expense of an overseer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>In many cases the plan succeeds remarkably well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>But in most cases of the kind, the master owes an important duty to his other slaves: it is to overlook the exercise of the delegated authority, and restrain the tendency to excessive severity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>There are other points at which this tendency is liable to display itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>The husband is likely to exhibit it in the authority exercised over the wife, and both the husband and the wife in the authority exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>over the children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>The husband is often found to beat and otherwise maltreat the wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>In fits of passion, some of them are extremely cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>The children are brought up in the same way. They are often subjected to cruel treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>Impatience, fretfulness, and stunning blows, make up the system of cabin-discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/><pb id="p.318" n="318"/>The child is often stultified in early life, and, without self-respect, grows up a stupid, slovenly, and insufferable eye-servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>Thus, that which made the young slave a source of so much annoyance in the kitchen, the chamber, and the dining-room, began in the discipline of the cabin, and with those who themselves were good servants, and who, for the most part, intended to do their duty in their humble way to their children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>Now, there are many families of great moral worth among us who entirely neglect the discipline of the cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>They take no account of the young negro, nor do they inquire into the treatment of wives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>This is a fault &mdash; a great fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>It presses with great force upon the interests of the master, as well as upon the domestic happiness of the <name>African</name> family and the moral character of the rising generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>The duty of the master is urgent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>He should restrain the exercise of cruelty to wives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>He should do the same in behalf of the children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>Both his example and his precepts should unite to introduce a sounder system of discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>A well-trained slave, who respects himself, is far more valuable in any view than a stupid eye-servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>The master who will not condescend to pay some attention to the discipline of the cabin must content himself with the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>the duties of masters to slaves as religious beings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>There are no duties which we owe our slaves as <quote>our money,</quote> or as social beings, which do not derive additional weight and importance from the fact that they are religious beings, and that, as such, we owe them all these duties, and still higher and more solemn duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/><quote>But I am not a Christian, and therefore am not concerned in the discussion of this topic.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>But I am not aware that to omit to profess to be an honest man, or to neglect to strive to be an honest man, absolves <pb id="p.321" n="321"/><num value="1">one</num> from the obligation to be honest: so neither will a failure to profess Christianity free any <num value="1">one</num> from the duty of being a Christian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>Both you and your slaves are religious beings; and if you are not a Christian, you ought to be, and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> will hold you to account for all the duties of a Christian life, whether in this world you acknowledge the obligation or not. Your slaves are entitled to the rights which belong to religious beings in their circumstances; and it is your duty to treat them as such; nor is there a single master who will not be held to a strict account for the faithful performance of these duties to his slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>The religious sentiment is strong in the <name>African</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>Both his mind and his heart respond readily to the fear of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the love of virtue, and the hope of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>But they are religious beings in a low state of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>Their intellects are usually dull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>They are subject to wild, extravagant, and superstitious opinions, and consequently to strong and violent religious emotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>They do not, as some suppose, have stronger feelings naturally than others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>They do not differ in this respect from barbarians of any other race of people; but they have a low grade of mental development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>Their wills, therefore, are not supplied with those motives which would enable them to hold their attention to views of truth <pb id="p.322" n="322"/>such as produce a more chastened, substantial, and elevated tone of <name>Christian</name> feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>For the want of enlightened views, the religious sentiment displays itself in superstitious conceits, which usually lead to wild and sometimes frantic feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>We need not dwell upon the evils of this state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>They are too obvious, in their influence upon the blacks, and oftentimes through them upon the nursery of white children, to require discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2456"/>That which demands attention is this: it is a duty which the master owes his slave to pursue that course in the government of his domestic empire which shall contribute to correct these evils, and to fit his slaves for their destiny in the spirit-world, where the distinction of master and slave will no longer exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2457"/>Aside, then, from other and less important objects in that Divine economy which introduced the <name>African</name> into this country, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has thereby committed to you these ignorant, these suffering poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>He requires you to care for their souls as well as their bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2459"/>The latter of these duties you may fulfil for your own interests merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2460"/>But each <num value="1">one</num> of them you ought faithfully to perform, both for <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake and for the common interests of yourselves and your slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/><quote>And ye masters, do the same things unto them:</quote> that is, as the context shows, serve their interests faithfully, and that for the <pb id="p.323" n="323"/>sake of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0062.0013.00323.00157" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, as they are required to serve your commands faithfully, and that for the sake of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0062.0013.00323.00158" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>But how may you do this?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>You should provide for them the means of public religious instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>The owner of a large plantation of slaves should charge himself with the expense of a minister of the gospel for his slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>Smaller plantations should unite to employ the services of a minister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2466"/>The owners of still smaller plantations in thinly settled communities of whites, should see that the usual supply of ministerial service for the neighborhood is sufficient to meet the demands of their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>Those who employ a minister, or those who unite with others to employ <num value="1">one</num> to devote himself to the religious instruction of their slaves, should see that he is a man of blameless life, of sound, practical <name>Christian</name> experience, simple in his language, familiar in his manners, and fervent in spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>He should devote himself to teach the children the oral catechism, to visit the sick, to bury the dead, and preach the gospel regularly on the <name>Sabbath</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>On all occasions of public worship on the <name>Sabbath</name>, both old and young should be required to be present, and in their best clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>Masters should occasionally attend all these meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>Our missions on plantations are fine examples of the system here recommended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>The Sabbath &mdash; the <pb id="p.324" n="324"/>Christian Sabbath &mdash; is the great civilizer of men. The clean skin, the <name>Sunday</name> suit, the companionship of friends, all unite with the sound instruction of the pulpit, and the warm-hearted reception of the truth, to raise man in the scale of being, to make him a better servant, and a better citizen &mdash; an heir, together with the master, of the inheritance of the saints in light.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>Those more densely populated white communities which are well supplied with the <rs>Christian</rs> ministry should afford ample accommodations to the colored population to hear the word of life, and share the blessings of the holy Sabbath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>Masters should see to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/>They have not done their duty when they subscribe to build a church in the neighborhood, and pay a trifle to the preacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>Their slaves should also be provided for. If they will not go to heaven themselves, their slaves can go there, and many of them desire to go there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>Their masters unjustly withhold the means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>In many instances, suitable provision is not made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>The houses are small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>The slaves are crowded out. They hear but little; at least, they are not instructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/>A still greater defect of this system in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is, the slaves are but poorly supplied with pastoral labor out of the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/>The sick are seldom visited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2483"/>The dead are only buried in crowds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2484"/>There is great room <pb id="p.325" n="325"/>then, for improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>Why may not the masters of a neighborhood engage the services of their minister to have a regular appointment for an afternoon on the plantation of some <num value="1">one</num>, for the benefit of the slaves of the neighborhood, and to visit their sick?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>I know many masters who are always ready to subscribe liberally to their minister if he would engage in this service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>Why should he not do it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>Perhaps some do. I should rejoice to see this system more generally adopted, and by our circuit preachers especially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>They would accomplish great good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>I doubt if a better remedy for the wants of the <name>African</name> population in such communities can be found.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>But not only to help supply this deficiency, but also on the score of its own intrinsic value, each family should contribute their personal attention to supply the religious wants of their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>The Sabbath should be a day of rest, of companionship, and of religious instruction and enjoyment in every family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>From no part of these should the slaves be excluded or overlooked in the domestic arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>That slaves appear in their clean Sunday-clothes, is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>They should all know that they are expected to be at church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>For the invalids and the aged, the means of conveyance should be provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>The old man, the old woman who nursed your parents, and who <pb id="p.326" n="326"/>have descended to you as the heir-looms of an ancient house; or, it may be, who began life with you, have nursed your children, and helped to build up your house and your fortune &mdash; shall they be forgotten in the feebleness of their age?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>Do they still stand to service, and help to make their bread; and when the merry crowd hies away <quote>to the Sabbath-meeting,</quote> shall the weight of their years make them turn to their seat, because they shrink from the journey of a few miles on foot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>This should not be. We should provide for the old and the infirm to ride to meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>I wonder some masters do not fear that an ungrateful son will <num value="1">one</num> day feed them in their old age in a private room and from a trencher, instead of at the family table and around the domestic hearthstone!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>To the credit of our system, the old family servants are generally honored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/><rs type="color">White</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> do reverence to their age and their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>This is right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>But why should the master think it beneath him to call the young together on a Sabbath afternoon, and invite the attendance of all the slaves, and instruct them orally in the truths and lessons of our holy religion: What <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is: what the <name>Saviour</name> is: what man is: what is to become of us when we die; and how we may be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>The simple forms of these truths as laid down in our Catechism may by any <num value="1">one</num> be made interesting <pb id="p.327" n="327"/>to children and instructive to all. The children should be taught by being made to repeat after us and respond all together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>Their attention will be aroused, and they will readily catch the idea of a great many truths that may lead them to fear <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and desire to do right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>Withal, it will make them feel that you care for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>They will think more of themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>They will rise in the scale of social being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>They will be less trouble to you. They will be more happy in themselves, and ultimately share with you the joys of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>Much of all that is here enjoined, any gentleman may do and ought to do, though he may not be a Christian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>He will himself be profited by the exercise it will give his mind on spiritual subjects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>I should not omit to notice, that in speaking of the duty of the <hi rend="italics">master</hi>, I use the term generically &mdash; I embrace the mistress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>All the duties enjoined require the cordial cooperation of the mistress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>Much of it, if done at all, must be done by her. She oftener has a heart to do it. She can do it, and, with a little encouragement, will do it, when other persons perhaps cannot or will not. If, then, the master will not be the high-priest as well as the lawgiver of his house, let him, at least, devolve a portion of the care for the religious interest of the slaves upon his wife, and especially that which relates to the instruction of the young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/><pb id="p.328" n="328"/>She, also, can often employ her own children to aid in this service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>It will both interest and instruct them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>So far as my observation goes, I am satisfied that the <rs>Southern</rs> family in which a proper discipline is maintained, and domestic religion, in that wide sense which embraces both blacks and whites is duly cultivated, for good order, for peace and quiet, for general morality and general prosperity, in all that concerns the comfort and happiness of a family, stands unrivalled in the history of the country. </p></div1></body><back> <pb id="p.adv.1" n="1"/>
