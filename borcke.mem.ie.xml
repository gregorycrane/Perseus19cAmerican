<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The kind interest with which the public received the <name>Memoirs</name> as they appeared in <quote><persName n="Blackwood,,,,," id="n0008.0001.00000.00001" reg="mostcommon:Blackwood,nomatch:0"><surname>Blackwood</surname></persName>'s Magazine</quote> induced me to think of republishing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>When they were on the point of republication, the news reached me that my <persName n="King,,,,," id="n0008.0001.00000.00002" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName> had called his people to arms against <placeName>Austria</placeName> and her allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I offered at once my sword to my native country, and had the proud satisfaction of fighting, in the <orgName>army of <persName n="Charles,Prince,Frederick,,," id="n0008.0001.00000.00003" reg="default:Charles,Frederick,,,"><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName></orgName>, in the great battle of Konigsgratz, and of taking part in the victorious advance through Bohemia, <placeName>Moravia</placeName>, and the <name>Duchy</name> of <placeName>Austria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>A new great war has turned the interest of the public to new matters,--many months have passed away since the termination of the great American struggle,--and many may have forgotten that the splendid <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">Army of Virginia</orgName> was ever in existence; but I do not hesitate to publish my account of battles lost and won, trusting that there are many still left who will read with some interest the simple narrative of a soldier who is proud to have shared the sufferings and the glory of the unfortunate people of the late Confederacy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>On the <dateStruct value="1862-04-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month> <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, I embarked at <placeName reg="Cobh, Cork, Munster" key="tgn,1042730">Queenstown</placeName> on board the fine new <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Hero</rs>, a vessel which had been built for running the blockade into the ports of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>, and was soon upon the bright waters of the <rs type="place">Channel</rs>, bound for the theatre of war in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Several most agreeable companions shared with me the accommodations of the steamer, and with smooth seas and pleasant skies we made a delightful voyage of <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure> to <placeName key="tgn,7006630;tgn,2535807" n="0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America" reg="nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, unattended by any other than the ordinary incidents of the ocean transit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Off the <rs>Spanish</rs> coast we skirted a heavy gale; but as we proceeded from high to low latitudes the weather became every day more and more charming, until we ran upon an even keel into the blue phosphorescent seas that lave the coral reefs of the <name>Bahamas</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Here we met with an interruption which seemed likely for a time to terminate my American adventures, if I may be allowed the <name>Hibernicism</name>, before they had begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>As we were nearing the island of New Providence, within sight of the island of Abaco, a steamer appeared on our quarter bearing towards us under <name>English</name> colours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The captain of the <rs>Hero</rs>, apprehending no trouble from a vessel which he mistook for the regular <name>English</name> mail-packet, kept on his course, though it <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> would have been an easy matter to escape the pursuit of the stranger had he supposed her intentions were unfriendly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As we came within range, a light puff of smoke from the stranger's side, and the whiz of a shell through the air a little astern of us, made it clear enough that the purpose was to board the <rs type="ship">Hero</rs>; and accordingly our engines were immediately stopped, and there speedily danced alongside a small boat, from which <num value="3">three</num> Federal officers ascended to our decks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The steamer proved to be the <term n="US gunboat">U. S. gunboat</term> <rs type="ship">Mercedita</rs>, and her commander, not doubting for a moment that he had made a valuable capture, had sent off a boat's crew to take possession of his prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Whether the officers who represented him were annoyed at discovering that the <rs>Hero</rs> was not as yet liable to capture, or whether incivility was habitual to them, it is certain that they behaved towards us with a degree of rudeness such as I have rarely witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>After a detention of <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure>, however, we were permitted to continue our course; the <rs>Federal</rs> officers rowed back to the <rs>Mercedita</rs>, and we had the satisfaction of seeing that vigilant cruiser soon become a mere speck on the evening horizon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I was the more disturbed by this most unwelcome visitation, because it deprived me of many valuable papers and Mss., letters of introduction, and the like, which, fearing they might be seized and read by our visitors, I burned upon their approach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>A few hours later the island of Abaco appeared plainly in view, and with the rich sunset we ran past the islets of coral, each tufted with tropical vegetation, which mark the entrance of the harbour of <placeName key="tgn,7006630;tgn,2535807" n="0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America" reg="nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The cargo of the <rs>Hero</rs> consisting in great part of powder, we were compelled, in accordance with the regulations of the port, to lie &mdash; to <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> off shore; but the vessel having been signalled, a boat was soon sent to us, from which stepped aboard a young <name>English</name> midshipman who could not have been more than <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> of age, <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> but who seemed fully conscious of the importance wherewith he was clothed by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This beardless officer, having taken a look at the ship's papers and a glass of grog with becoming dignity, returned to <placeName key="tgn,7006630;tgn,2535807" n="0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America" reg="nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, leaving us ill content to remain all night in the steamer, from which we saw the sparkling lights of the city and caught the delicious perfume wafted seaward from the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>At <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> next morning we found the ship surrounded by barges filled with negroes, who clamoured loudly for the privilege of taking us ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We had some difficulty in conducting negotiations from the ship's side amid the horrible din that assailed our ears, but we at last succeeded in securing a boat with <num value="6">six</num> dusky oarsmen, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of them Africans by birth, who pulled us to the landing in <measure n="2.5hours" type="date">two and a half hours</measure>. The sun poured down upon the sea with almost intolerable fervour, but there was refreshment in looking into the cool blue water, which was so marvellously clear that we could easily distinguish the pebbles strewn upon the bottom at the depth of <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>New Providence is the smallest of the <name>Bahamas</name>, belonging to the <rs>West Indian Archipelago</rs>, and contains about <num value="13000">13,000</num> inhabitants, of whom <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> are free negroes, under the colonial government of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This large and comfortable establishment occupies the highest point of the island, and looks down upon the town, which stretches away to the right and left, terraced from the sea in regular gradations of ascent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>What strikes <num value="1">one</num> most <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> forcibly in the external appearance of <placeName key="tgn,7006630;tgn,2535807" n="0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America" reg="nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName> are the violent contrasts it presents to the eye. Nothing is subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The white Spanish houses absolutely glister in the overpowering glare of the sun. The roofs are as white as if they were covered with snow, being constructed, like the walls, of the coral formation of the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The streets and roadways are dazzlingly white, and an impalpable dust rises in white clouds from every passing vehicle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The men are dressed in white from top to toe-white muslin turbans around their straw hats, and their feet encased in white canvass shoes, like those worn by the boating crews of the <rs>Thames</rs> rowing-clubs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Such are the lights of the picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The shadows are supplied by the dark foliage of the orange and banana trees, the dense shade of the laurel thickets, and the intense black of the faces of the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Black waiters at the hotel, black shopkeepers in the town, black soldiers on guard, black <hi rend="italics">belles</hi> on the promenade &mdash; the effect was striking against the whiteness of the buildings and the thoroughfares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The <quote>irrepressible negro</quote> asserts himself immensely at <placeName key="tgn,7006630;tgn,2535807" n="0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America" reg="nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He seeks, and not altogether in vain, to unite the greatest possible amount of consequence with the least possible amount of work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But the negro women amused me most of any. In all their native hideousness of form and feature, they bedizen their persons with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> costumes, of every fashion, fabric, and colour, and walk the streets with a solemn dignity that even a Spanish hidalgo might envy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I had not supposed that I should be so much impressed with the variety and beauty of the vegetable and insect life of the tropics; but even the broiling sun did not deter me from making daily little excursions around the island, armed with a white cotton umbrella, and wearing, after the manner of the foreign residents, the broad-brimmed <placeName reg="Panama, Provincia de Panama, Panama" key="tgn,7006455">Panama</placeName> hat with its encircling muslin turban.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I must have afforded some amusement to the natives, and others familiar with tropical scenery, <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> as I stalked abroad thus defended, stopping every now and then to examine some strange and beautiful flower, or to admire the innumerable humming-birds and gorgeous butterflies that fluttered above it, or to purchase, at the stalls of the incessantly chattering negresses, luscious fruits which they offered me, and of which I did not even know the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The heat of the day was tempered, up to the hour of <time value="10am">10 A. M.</time>, by a mild sea-breeze, but the air then became perfectly calm and slumberous, and about mid-day the sun was burning with such power that <num value="1">one</num> felt oppressed as by a leaden weight upon the chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I rose generally at <time value="5am">five in the morning</time> and strolled down to the negro cottages, some of which were very pleasant little dwellings, and all were surrounded by small gardens filled with a profusion of fruit and flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Here I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw the <rs n="pine apple" type="product">pine-apple</rs> growing in the open air, the orangetree, heavy with its golden globes and fragrant blossoms, the palmetto, and the cocoa-palm with its ripening nuts, the cactus of every size, from the small creeper, winding along the rocks and walls, to the large tree-like specimen that lifts its head high above the ground, and flings out its scarlet bloom like a banner in the air. Near to the hotel was a magnificent cotton-tree of tremendous size, the trunk being <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> in diameter, and the branches covering nearly an acre of ground, which was justly esteemed the pride of the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Here, as indeed everywhere else, were hundreds of lizards darting over the rocky surface, of which the most interesting was the chameleon, so strangely and rapidly changing its colours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Among the guests in the <rs type="place">Royal Victoria Hotel</rs> at this time were many gentlemen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, who, as soon as my intentions were made known to them, manifested the liveliest interest in my behalf; and a number of captains of steamers destined for Southern parts, with like unanimity, offered me a free passage to the <quote>sunny South.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It was our custom to assemble on the highest verandah of the building <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> to witness the setting of the sun, which seemed to dive into the blue ocean, reddening and gilding with transient splendours the distant reefs of coral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>No lingering, pensive twilight, such as belongs to the latitude of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in the long days of summer, marks the approach of night in the <name>Bahamas</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>For a brief period sky and wave are tinged with crimson, and then <quote>at <num value="1">one</num> stride came the dark.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The decline of the sun was the signal for all the flowers, shrivelled and half-killed by the day's heat, to open their long-closed petals, lading the air with voluptuous perfumes, which were borne to us by every passing breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Myriads of fire-flies glittered around us; the temperature was delightful; the stars shone with a brilliancy unknown to me; and I enjoyed the strange, mysterious beauty of those tropical nights more deeply than I can express. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I had linked my fortunes upon the <rs>Atlantic</rs> with those of the <rs>Hero</rs>, but it very soon appeared that she would be obliged to unload a portion of her cargo at <placeName key="tgn,7006630;tgn,2535807" n="0.034 000000.0682	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;0.034 000000.0682	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America" reg="nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, and thus be detained at that port for several weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The news from <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> by every arrival became more and more exciting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It appeared inevitable that heavy battles would very soon be fought before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and I earnestly desired to take an active part in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>My position, besides, was embarrassing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>My letters of introduction and recommendation had been destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I did not know a human being in the foreign country whither I was going, nor did I even speak the <rs>English</rs> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I was at a loss, therefore, to conjecture how I should carry out my objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>At this juncture, <num value="1">one</num> of my travelling companions, Mr W., readily apprehending my difficulty, gave me the best proof of his friendship by offering to run the blockade with me in the next steamer to <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName>, and accompany me, without loss of time, to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, where he would present me to the authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Accordingly we found ourselves, <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> after our arrival at <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.051 000000.1023	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.017 000000.0341	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, early on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-05-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, on board the steamer <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> <persName><foreName>Kate</foreName></persName>, and soon <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.051 000000.1023	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.017 000000.0341	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, with its white houses and white streets, and dark laurel thickets, and harbour crowded with steamers, among which I regarded with peculiar interest the well-known <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, was far behind us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> of our voyage to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> passed without incident, but on the morning of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> we ran in sight of the coast of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and the greatest excitement prevailed in our small community, the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName> being, as we knew, not far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Our furnaces were fed with the anthracite coal of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, which emits but little smoke to arrest the notice of blockaders; yet we proceeded very cautiously at half-speed, until we arrived within <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> by chart of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> harbour, when we stopped to await the protecting darkness of the coming night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>At that time running the blockade was not thought so easy a matter as it afterwards proved to be, and the anxiety of many of our passengers began to be gravely and, in some cases, ludicrously exhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The vigilant captain did not leave the mast-head; and whoever could procure a marine glass swept the line of sea and sky for hours together, looking out in every direction with the greatest solicitude for the dreaded sails of the <rs>Federal</rs> cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I had myself got my arms ready, and gathered together such of my effects as I supposed I should need most in future campaigning, so that in case we should be chased and obliged to abandon the vessel I might be able to carry them with me in the small boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>But no cruiser appeared, all remained quiet, and about dusk the sky began to be darkened with heavy clouds, which were greeted by us with extreme satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>There was a large quantity of powder on board the <rs type="ship">Kate</rs>, and this powder for some reason had been stored immediately beneath the decks: we had therefore an uncomfortably reasonable prospect of being blown into eternity by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shell from the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> that should be only too well directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The captain had <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> informed us of this circumstance before he consented to receive us as passengers, but we willingly accepted the risk, <quote>trusting to luck</quote> as to the steamer and ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>At nightfall our engines were again set in motion; the clouds had overspread the whole firmament; only here and there a star twinkled through the black canopy; and the sombre silence was unbroken save by the sound of the paddles striking against the water, and the whispers of our ship's company, who were all on deck peering most anxiously into the surrounding darkness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It was about an hour past midnight when, reaching the entrance of the harbour of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, we discovered a red light on our right hand, a green light on our left hand, and <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> others of various colours at a little distance all around us. These were the <rs>Federal</rs> blockaders awaiting their prey, and right between them had we to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The excitement now mounted to its highest point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The reflection of the red light upon the water ran out towards us like the coil of a fiery serpent, seeming to touch the wheelhouse, and to sport with the reflection of the green light from the opposite quarter, and we expected every moment to hear the booming of the blockaders' guns; but good fortune favoured us &mdash; the dreaded lights were soon glimmering in our wake-and from the frowning fortress of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> there thundered forth, as we interpreted it, a friendly salute that gladdened every heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>With no complimentary intentions, however, was this gun fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We had been mistaken for an enemy, and had a narrow escape of being sent to the bottom by Confederate cannoneers, after having safely passed the perils of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Our engines were immediately stopped, a boat came off from the fort, explanations and congratulations were interchanged, after which we moved in perfect security up the harbour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The early morning found me awake and looking with great interest upon the strange land where I knew not what the immediate future had in store for me. <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> lay before me in the full splendour of the newly-risen sun, and presented &mdash; with its harbour full of vessels, its commodious villa-like private dwellings, its luxuriant gardens, its straight streets lined on either side by noble trees, its sparkling sea-front, against which the blue wave broke gently-a magnificent appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>As I walked into the town I could not fail to remark the absence of that bustle <num value="1">one</num> usually finds in a large city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>This was explained by the fact that an attack by the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> was daily expected, in consequence of which many places of business were closed, and many families had gone into the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But if the traffic of the town was suspended, the streets gave evidence everywhere of great military activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Companies of infantry in every variety of dress and armed with all sorts of weapons were marching about, and cavalrymen in the most picturesque costumes were galloping up and down on fine-looking horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Accustomed as I was to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> discipline and uniform, I must confess that on me the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression of these Confederate soldiers was not favourable, and far was I from any idea how soon these same men would excite my highest admiration on the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>But I had little opportunity for extended observation at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The train for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> left the station about noon, and I was of its passengers, wondering at the odd-shaped, long lumbering railway carriage or <quote>car,</quote> rolling, rapidly and dangerously, with more than <num value="50">fifty</num> other occupants, towards the scene of military operations in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I need say nothing of the wretched railway system, or want of system, of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>; the single line of rails, the loosely-built road-bed, the frightful trestle-work over deep <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> gorges, the frail wooden bridges thrown across rushing rivers, and the headlong speed at which the train is often urged on its perilous way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Whizzing through the rice and cotton fields, the oozy swamps and dark pine-woods of the <num value="2">two</num> Carolinas, we came at last to forests of oak and hickory, alternating with peaceful-looking farms and fertile estates in the fair land of the <quote>Old Dominion;</quote> and, crossing the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> upon a bridge of giddy elevation, we entered within the walls of the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Opposite the upper portion of the city the river flows between lofty hills over a rocky bed, which breaks it into innumerable cascades, murmuring in the stillness of the night a perpetual lullaby to the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>In the immediate centre of the town is a pretty little park, with several fine statues, some trumpery fountains, and a grove of umbrageous lindens, surrounding the <rs>Capitol</rs>, a large building of brick and stucco, erected in <dateStruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></dateStruct>, which looks noble in the distant view, but is mean and paltry upon near approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The streets are long and straight, intersecting each other, with few exceptions, at right angles, and shaded throughout the larger part of the city's limits by native trees, the maple and tulip-poplar predominating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Pleasant dwellings, with porticoes and trellised verandahs, embowered in gardens, crowned the hills-dwellings that <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> still remain to render more painful by contrast the ruin caused by the great conflagration which, <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> later, laid the whole business quarter of the town in ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The din of active preparation struck continuously upon the ear in the roar of the forge, and the clatter of the army-waggon, and the heavy tramp of armed men. Large bodies of troops were marching and countermarching through the streets, orderlies and couriers were galloping about in every direction, and the notes of the fife and drum had hardly died away in the distance before the echoes were waked by the stormier music of a full military band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The vast <orgName>army of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0008.0002.00011.00004" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName></orgName> hovered upon the northern and eastern skirts of the city, and over the line of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, which might be faintly traced from the tops of the highest buildings, his camp-fires could even be seen by night, and his balloons of observation, hanging like oranges in the sky, were clearly discernible in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It was plain enough that an attack of the enemy in heavy force was expected at any moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Under such exciting circumstances it was no less remarkable than gratifying to see how calmly and with what perfect confidence the people awaited the momentous events which were so near at hand. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>In the uncertain state of affairs at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the prices of all articles in the shops augmented daily, but I converted my gold into Confederate money at a broker's at the liberal rate <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> of <num value="2">two</num> for <num value="1">one</num>, and thought it a very clever financial operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The difficulties I met with, however, in securing a position in the army were far greater than I had expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The ashes of my letters of introduction were suspended in the restless waters of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The <rs type="place">Government stables</rs> were full of good horses, and I had no difficulty in finding an excellent chestnut mare, which afterwards carried me nobly on many a hard ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>At the earliest dawn of morning, on the <dateStruct value="--30"><day reg="2">30th</day></dateStruct>, an orderly reported to me with the mare in front of my hotel, and I jumped into the saddle, well equipped from head to foot, full of strength and buoyant in spirits, to ride forward to the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>We trotted out of the city, and across the wooded plain through which runs the <rs type="place">Brooke turnpike</rs>, passing the extensive fortifications and the long lines of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>. <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> With the liveliest interest I looked upon these masses of warrior-like men, in their ill-assorted costumes, who had come with alacrity from the <name>Carolinas</name>, from distant <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and yet more distant <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, from sunny <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, from fertile <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, land of mountain and canebrake, from the regions of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, to imperil their lives in the defence of their much-loved South, and for the expulsion of the invader from its borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Brigade after brigade we saw awaiting the summons to the battle which was so soon to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Here I presented myself for information to the officer in command, <persName n="Lee,Colonel,Fitzhugh,,," id="n0008.0002.00013.00010" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Fitzhugh</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who assured me that it would be next to impossible to find <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0002.00013.00011" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> that night, and kindly offered me the hospitality of his tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>As threatening thunderclouds were driving up the western horizon, and I was much fatigued by my day's ride, I gladly accepted the invitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The camp was a novelty to me in the art of castrametation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The horses were not picketed in regular lines as in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> armies, but were scattered about anywhere in the neighbouring wood, some tethered to swinging limbs, some tied to small trees, others again left to browse at will upon the undergrowth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>In a very short time I was perfectly at home in the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s tent, where the officers of his regiment had assembled, and where the lively strains of the banjo alternated with patriotic songs and animated discourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>During the evening a supper was served which, under existing circumstances, was really luxurious, and <num value="1">one</num> of the chief dishes of which consisted of the eggs of the terrapin found in a creek near the camp by <persName n="Lee,Colonel,,,," id="n0008.0002.00013.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s faithful negro servant, who was at once head-cook, valet, and steward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>I am sure that no work of art from the kitchen of the <rs>Cafe Riche</rs> could have <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> been more gratifying to my hungry appetite than these terrapin's eggs taken out of a Virginia swamp and cooked upon the instant in a cavalry encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Soon after supper we retired to rest, but little sleep came to my weary eyelids; for a terrible hurricane, accompanied by thunder and lightning, raged throughout the night, the peals of thunder shaking the earth, and the flashes of lightning almost blinding me with their incessant vivid glare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>I was awake and fully dressed the next morning when, with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glimpse of the sun breaking through the battered clouds, the trumpet sounded to saddle, and <persName n="Lee,Colonel,,,," id="n0008.0002.00014.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> informed me that he had just received marching orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>He added that he should start in <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>, and my best chance of meeting <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0002.00014.00014" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was to ride with the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It was marvellous to see how recently these unmilitary-looking troopers obeyed the orders of their colonel, and with what discipline and rapidity the breaking up of the camp was managed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>I suffered the whole regiment, <num value="800">800</num> strong, to pass me, that I might observe more narrowly its composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The scrutiny called forth my admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The men were all <persName n="Virginians,,,,," id="n0008.0002.00014.00015" reg="mostcommon:Virginians,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginians</surname></persName>, whose easy and graceful seat betrayed the constant habit of horseback exercise, and they were mounted mostly on blooded animals, some of which the most ambitious Guardsman or the most particular <quote>swell</quote> in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> would have been glad to show off in <placeName reg="Hyde Park, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015004">Hyde Park</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Looking back across <num value="3">three</num> eventful years to that morning's march, I realise how little it was in my thought that my lot should be knit so closely with that of these brave fellows in fatigue and in fight, and that I should have to mourn the loss of, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>It was at this moment that <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0003.00018.00027" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> sent me with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> order to <persName n="Lee,Colonel,,,," id="n0008.0003.00018.00028" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>To reach him I had to ride more to the front, and to cross a morass, where some horses belonging to the ambulances were standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Just as I rode past I heard a loud whiz in the air, and saw <num value="1">one</num> of the horses struck down, and at the same moment was almost deafened by an explosion, which covered me with mud and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shell that had burst so close to me, and a strange feeling came over me at the thought of having been so near death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It was not fear, but a vivid realisation of the pitiless power of destruction which is let loose in war. I discharged my commission without farther adventure, and returned to the <rs>Generals</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The battle had meanwhile been turning in our favour; our troops were slowly pressing back the whole Federal line; only in the centre of our <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> a <orgName type="mil" key="NCBrigade">North Carolina brigade</orgName> had begun to give way a little before the superior strength of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>I followed him into the hail of bullets, of whizzing grape and bursting bombs, <num value="1">one</num> of which rolled between my horse's legs. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Our men had now expended almost all their ammunition, <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> and were falling back, when <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0003.00019.00030" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, here with threats, there with eloquent entreaties, rallied them, and brought them forward again into the battle to check the enemy as they pressed hard upon us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>A Virginia brigade soon came up as reinforcement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>With banners flying, and loud war-cries, they threw themselves unhesitatingly on the foe, driving them before them, and taking their earthworks, which bristled with cannon. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The setting sun lighted up with crimson splendour a broad and bloody battle-field, strewn with the dead and wounded of the enemy, and as many brave Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Numerous prisoners were being brought up from all sides, whom every man and officer not absolutely required to fill the thinning ranks was employed to convey away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The most horrible spectacle was that presented near the bastions and earthworks which the day before had been stormed by our men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>He was a stout man, of middle height, and most agreeable countenance; his long brown beard gave something leonine to his appearance; an engaging simplicity was his prevailing characteristic, manifested not less in his manners than in his dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The next day did not pass without excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>A renewed attack from the enemy was expected, and our troops were kept for the greater part of the day under arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>This place, standing at some distance from the highroad, was surrounded by copses and thickets, and afforded us a capital opportunity of recovering from our fatigues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>We had to provide our own food, which, in consequence of the prevailing scarcity, was scanty and bad; a little bacon and maize-bread composed our breakfast, dinner, and supper, and we thought it an extraordinary luxury when we could gather wild strawberries enough in the wood to make a dish to add to our repast. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>This ride was strangely exciting to me; now that I have become so accustomed to such expeditions, I could go through it with the most perfect composure, but then I was feverishly agitated, and every rustling bough, every bird flying past, increased the strain. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Such rides and expeditions were habitual with this bold General, and we often escaped as by a miracle from the dangers which surrounded us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>None of us knew where we were going; <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0003.00026.00060" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> only communicated the object of the expedition to the colonels commanding; nevertheless every <num value="1">one</num> followed our honoured leader with perfect confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>We marched the whole day long without halting, and towards evening bivouacked near the little town of <placeName reg="Taylorsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2114568">Taylorsville</placeName> in <placeName reg="Hanover county, Virginia" key="tgn,1002451">Hanover County</placeName>, where we were already within the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>At daybreak we again mounted our horses, and our <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> vanguard was soon reported to have met with a party of the enemy's dragoons, who on their approach had hurried off in hasty flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Without waiting to pursue them, we continued our march, greeted everywhere with enthusiasm by the inhabitants, especially by the ladies, who for a long time had seen none other than Federal troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>A few miles from <placeName reg="Hanover Court-house">Hanover Court-house</placeName> we surprised a picket of the enemy's cavalry, every man of which fell into our hands from the suddenness of our attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Whilst we were occupied with sending the prisoners to the rear, our advance-guard came back at a run, hotly pursued by a large body of the enemy's dragoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Our leading squadron spurred immediately forward to meet the attack, and, having obtained <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0003.00027.00062" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s permission, I joined them as with loud war-cries they hurled themselves against the blue masses of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> were not able to withstand the impetuous onset of the <rs>Virginia</rs> horsemen, and, after a <hi rend="italics">melee</hi> of a very few minutes, there commenced a most exciting chase, which was continued for nearly <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>. Friend and foe were soon enveloped in blinding clouds of dust, through which pistol and carbine shots were seen darting to and fro like flashes of lightning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The larger number of the enemy escaped, thanks to their fresher animals, but we took many of them prisoners, and their dead and wounded men and horses encumbered the road as we pushed along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Half an hour later our advanceguard again came in collision with the enemy, who had rallied, and, with strong reinforcements, were awaiting us. <num value="2">Two</num> squadrons of the <orgName type="regiment" key="9VACav">9th Virginia Cavalry</orgName> were immediately sent forward to the attack, and I received orders from <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0003.00027.00063" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to hasten with our main column to the scene of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>I rode at once to bring on the main column; but <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> though I used the utmost speed to get back in time to take part in the charge, when I arrived at the scene of the sharp conflict the work had already been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The enemy's lines were broken and in full flight, leaving many of their dead and wounded, and a large number of prisoners, among whom were several officers, in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>We had to lament the loss of the gallant <persName n="Latane,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0003.00028.00064" reg="mostcommon:Latane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Latane</surname></persName>, who, while boldly leading his men, fell pierced by <num value="5">five</num> bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>In a few seconds the <orgName type="regiment" key="1VACav">1st Virginia Cavalry</orgName> had arrived, and we instantly dashed forward in pursuit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The enemy made <num value="1">one</num> more attempt to rally, but their lines were broken by our furious attack; they fled in confusion, and we chased them in wild pursuit across an open field, through their camp, and far into the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>When we had returned to their camp the work of destruction began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> tried to rescue for himself as much as possible of the articles of luxury with which the <rs>Yankees</rs> had overloaded themselves, but few succeeded in the end; for, in accordance with the well-laid plan of our leader, flames flashed up, now in <num value="1">one</num> place, now in another, and in a few minutes the whole camp was enveloped in <num value="1">one</num> blaze, hundreds of tents burning together presenting a wonderfully beautiful spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Many horses and mules, and <measure n="2" type="captured">two captured</measure> standards, were all that we carried off with us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We now found ourselves in the heart of the enemy's position, and their encampment lay around us on all sides.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>On either side of the road we constantly seized upon unsuspecting Federal soldiers, who had no idea of the close proximity of the dreaded <rs>Stuart</rs> until collared by his horsemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>A considerable number of waggons laden with provisions and goods fell into our hands, among them <num value="1">one</num> containing the personal stores of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0008.0003.00029.00066" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, with his cigars, wines, and other dainties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>But we could not be burdened with booty, so the entire train was committed to the flames, the champagne popped bootlessly, and the cabanas wasted their fragrance on the air. <num value="3">Three</num> transport-ships which lay in the river <rs>Pamunkey</rs> near at hand, laden with wheat, corn, and provisions from all quarters, were seized by us, together with the guard and the agents stationed there, and ere long the flames mounting towards heaven proclaimed how complete was our work of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>A brigade of the enemy's cavalry here sought to intercept our way and to detain us till the troops, which were marching upon us from all sides, could arrive; but it was broken by our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack, and crossed our path no more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Thus towards evening we reached the railroad which was so useful to the enemy in giving them communication with the north; and just as the demolition of the road-bed was about to begin, the train was seen coming up. Without delay <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0003.00029.00067" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> posted a portion of his men on either side of the embankment, with orders to fire if the train refused to stop at the station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The train moved slowly nearer and nearer, puffing off the steam, and we could soon perceive that it was laden with soldiers, most of them being in open carriages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>As the command to stop was disregarded, but on the contrary the movement of the train was accelerated, firing began along our whole line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The engine-driver was shot down by <persName n="Farley,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0003.00029.00068" reg="mostcommon:Farley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Farley</surname></persName>, to whom I had lent my blunderbuss; but before the <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> deadly bullet reached him he had put the train in somewhat quicker motion, so that we could not make ourselves masters of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>A battle of the strangest description now arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Some of the soldiers in the train returned our fire, others sprang out to save themselves by flight, or lay down flat at the bottom of the carriages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The train, though its motion had been quickened, was not going at so rapid a pace that we could not keep up with it by galloping hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Meantime, having had my hat almost knocked off my head by <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's bullets, I became so wildly excited that, without heeding our own fire, I spurred my horse over the embankment, and very soon had discharged all the <num value="5">five</num> charges of my revolver at the foe. We heard later that few of the occupants of the train had escaped unhurt; the greater part were either killed or severely wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>I reproached myself afterwards with having so given the reins to my passion; but after all I only acted in obedience to orders and the requirements of war. After having done as much injury as we could to the railroad, we proceeded on our march, whilst the last beams of the sun lighted up the scene of destruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It had been a hard ride and a hard day's work, and my parched tongue was cleaving to the roof of my mouth, when <num value="1">one</num> of our men galloped up to me, and held out a bottle of champagne, saying, <quote><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, you did pretty hot work to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>I got this bottle of champagne for you out of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0008.0003.00030.00069" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s waggon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It will do you good.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Never in my life have I enjoyed a bottle of wine so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Late in the evening a baggage-train and <num value="2">two</num> sutler's waggons fell into our hands, and we took possession of a large quantity of luxuries, such as pickles, oysters, preserved fruits, oranges, lemons, and cigars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>About <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> we had an hour's rest to feed our horses, and then rode on all the night through towards the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> River, which we reached at <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>From the reports we had received we expected to find little difficulty in fording the stream, but who can describe our astonishment at finding it so swollen by the rain which had fallen in the mountains during the past twentyfour hours that the water was more than <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> deep!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>At the same time our <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName> announced that a whole division of the enemy was on our track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> felt the weight of the danger that threatened us, every <num value="1">one</num> looked with anxiety towards our leader, who, with the greatest possible calmness and coolness, gave his orders and made his arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>A bridge for foot-passengers was hastily constructed across the stream, which was about <measure n="90feet" type="distance">ninety feet</measure> in breadth, and the saddles, &amp;c., were carried over it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>This last expedient I thought the best, and in this manner I took <num value="65">sixty-five</num> horses myself through the angry torrent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>After about <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> work a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> bridge for the artillery was completed, and more than half the horses had reached the other side of the river; also the prisoners, about <num value="500">five hundred</num> in number, and hundreds of captured horses and mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cannon was drawn by the soldiers across the bridge, which, standing the test well, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> soon followed, and then the reserve regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Hitherto I had had no sensation of fatigue, but after this hard work in the water I <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> felt it severely in all my limbs, and we had still to march the remainder of the day and all the night before we could rest in security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Both horses and men performed wonders during this expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>As soon as I had attended to my horse, who had carried me nobly through the severe fatigue, I fell fast asleep, and so continued during the whole day and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Our march was directed towards <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, where the enemy's <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> rested, as I have said, on strong fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>With the exception of encounters with small patrols, we saw little of the enemy until <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> in the afternoon, when <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s vanguard attacked them, and was soon engaged in a sharp skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Jackson at once brought up his troops with his usual celerity of movement, and towards <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> the battle was at its height. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Our cavalry was in reserve, and as we had reason to fear an attack on the left flank, <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00037.00098" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> despatched me with a small body of men on a reconnoitring expedition, which was so far successful that, after about half an hour's ride, we came upon a strong detachment of the enemy's cavalry, who instantly set to work to chase us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>This created extreme confusion among our pursuers; they left their dead and wounded behind them, and took to immediate flight, followed by <num value="1">one</num> of our regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Meanwhile the battle was going in our favour; the enemy were driven from <num value="1">one</num> position to another, and by <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> at night were retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Our cavalry force occupied its old position on the left flank of our army, and during the forenoon of the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num> had several encounters with the enemy's horse, all which, as was usual at that time, terminated in our favour. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/><num value="1">One</num> of these encounters, an affair of a few minutes, was with a newly-organised regiment of Federal Lancers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They stood <measure n="300yards" type="distance">300 yards</measure> from us in line of battle, and presented, with their glittering lances, from the point of each of which fluttered a red-and-white pennon, and their fresh, well-fitting blue uniforms turned up with yellow, a fine martial appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/><num value="1">One</num> of our regiments was immediately ordered to attack them; but before our <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> horsemen got within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of their line, this magnificent regiment, which had doubtless excited the liveliest admiration in the <rs>Northern</rs> cities on its way to the seat of war, turned tail and fled in disorder, strewing the whole line of their retreat with their picturesque but inconvenient arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The entire skirmish, if such it may be called, was over in less time than is required to record it; and I do not believe that out of the whole body of <num value="700">700</num> men more than <num value="20">twenty</num> retained their lances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Their <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> sudden and total discomfiture furnished a striking proof of the fact that this weapon, formidable enough in the hand of <num value="1">one</num> accustomed to wield it, is a downright absurdity and encumbrance to the inexperienced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>About <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the afternoon the battle became general along the lines, and at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> raged in its full fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The fire of musketry rolled continuously, and more than <num value="150">150</num> howitzers and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0008.0004.00039.00101" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> and Parrot guns opened all around us, and united in <num value="1">one</num> incessant roar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The ground being not favourable for cavalry operations, we occupied a place on the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of the line of battle, but were nearly all day under fire of the enemy's cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/><persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00039.00102" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, accompanied by his Staff and personal escort, pressed forward with his <num value="2">two</num> batteries of <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse-artillery</orgName>, which, under the command of my gallant friend <persName n="Pelham,,John,,," id="n0008.0004.00039.00103" reg="default:Pelham,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Pelham</surname></persName>, soon did most admirable execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The enemy at once concentrated the fire of <num value="5">five</num> batteries on this point, and every kind of missile hurtled heavily through the smoky air, spreading death and destruction on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>I had many a hot ride during the afternoon through this tempest of shot and shell, and it appears now almost incomprehensible that I escaped uninjured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It was about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> when <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00039.00104" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> returned with us to his cavalry, which had been, and were still, suffering severely from the fire of a battery that had been boldly pressed forward to a favourable position, and kept thundering down on our much-exposed horsemen with rapid and terrible discharges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Just as we were galloping along the line, the enemy opened upon us with grape and canister, and our men began to waver a little, the ranks getting into some confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>At this moment <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00039.00105" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, who had to ride a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> farther to meet <persName n="Lee,Colonel,Fitz,,," id="n0008.0004.00039.00106" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, turned round to me, saying, <quote><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, I wish you to remain here with my Staff and escort until I come back, to give a good <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> example to the men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>So we had to stand for many minutes in this diabolical fire of canister, which came rattling along the hard dry ground, or howled over us right and left-a pretty severe trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It requires but little courage to attack the enemy, or even to ride about composedly under fire, in comparison with what is demanded to sit quietly in face of several batteries, from which, with every momentary puff of smoke from the mouths of the guns, <num value="1">one</num> may reasonably expect the messenger of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>A shell which exploded directly over our heads tore nearly to pieces the captain of the squadron nearest to me, with whom I had just been talking, and killed or wounded several of the men. But our example had a telling effect; the ranks closed up and remained in good order until the command was given, and the long line of horsemen, soon in rapid trot, disappeared behind a range of friendly hills. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/><persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00040.00107" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and Staff now galloped forward again to our artillery, which in the mean time had lost many men and horses, but was still answering with the greatest energy the galling fire of the numerous batteries of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Just at this time a little incident occurred, which, in the very carnival of death, provoked our hearty laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/><num value="1">One</num> of our Staffofficers, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> , whom we had often joked about the nimble and successful manner in which he dodged the shells of the enemy, and who had this day again made the politest obeisance to their missiles, annoyed at our raillery, had declared that he would never again bow at their approach, and was sitting with the utmost gravity bolt-upright in the saddle, when a <num value="12">12</num>-pounder solid shot screamed through the air only a few feet over his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Down went the head not merely to the saddle, but, with the body to which it was still securely attached, to the earth, amidst the convulsive shouts of his comrades and the cannoneers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Another incident which we witnessed about the same time, produced no less merriment <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> amid the fury of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>A wounded man was borne along by <num value="2">two</num> of his comrades, his limbs hanging motionless and his head dangling bout as if life was nearly extinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The fire of the enemy was still murderous, and <num value="1">one</num> of the carriers, struck by a musket-ball, fell to the ground, dropping his charge, who, seeing himself in great danger, suddenly revived, and, jumping up, took to his heels with the most surprising agility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The explosive laughter which followed him in his rapid flight all along our lines absolutely drowned for a few moments the tumult and hurly-burly of the engagement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>About <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> in the evening I was sent by <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00041.00108" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to order to the front <num value="2">two</num> squadrons of our <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> regiment to attack <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Federal</rs> batteries which, without proper support, had been making a very bold advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The enemy had brought up to the distant heights <num value="20">twenty</num> pieces of rifled ordnance, which, by undue elevation, firing too high for the effect they desired, were playing upon an open space of ground over which I had to ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The fire was so terrific that I found <num value="1">one</num> of our reserve batteries, not actively engaged at the moment, entirely deserted by its gunners, who had sought protection with the horses in a deep ravine, and who cried out to me to dismount and join them, or certain death must be my fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I pushed on, and reached my destination in safety; but galloping back I felt a stunning blow across the spine, and at the same moment my horse rolled over with me. I was confident the animal had been struck by cannon-ball; but, to my great surprise, I was not able to discover any wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>As I was myself unhurt, I remounted my brave animal, and continued my way. A solid shot had passed close to my horse's back, and the current of air set in motion by its passage had knocked over both horse and rider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Afterwards, during the war, I witnessed many similar cases of prostration of men and animals by <quote>windage.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/><pb id="p.42" n="42"/> </p> 
<p>At <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> in the evening the battle had taken the most favourable turn for our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>At this time the enemy, who had offered throughout the day the most obstinate resistance, intrenched in very strong positions, and attacking us in the centre with <num value="25000">25,000</num> regular troops, the <hi rend="italics">elite</hi> of <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0008.0004.00042.00109" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, began slowly to give way before the impetuous valour of our men, who drove these veterans from <num value="1">one</num> intrenchment to another, until, at <time value="8pm">eight P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of prisoners, among whom were <num value="2">two</num> generals, several colonels, and many inferior officers, a large number of field-pieces, and many flags, fell into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Returning, we were compelled to ride with great caution, for the field was strewn with wounded men, many of whom had crept to the edge of the highroad to get within reach of the ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>There is no sadder sight than that of a battle-field after the conflict is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Happily, night at this moment veiled from us its full horrors; but there was an overwhelming sense of utter hopelessness in riding among so many poor fellows, whom <num value="1">one</num> would have so much liked to assist, even with the <quote>cup of cold water,</quote> --brave fellows, groaning in their agony, and calling upon every passer-by for help &mdash; with an entire consciousness on our part of the fearful aggregate of the misery, and, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>of the little we could do for its alleviation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>We encamped upon the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>About midnight I felt myself touched on the shoulder; and when, grasping the hilt of my sword, I abruptly demanded who was there, a mild voice answered me, <quote><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00042.00111" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>I left them alone, those grand warriors, in their midnight council, and wandered about, meditating on the stirring events of the day. I was deeply impressed by the blackness of the night and the profound stillness of the slumbering camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Here and there a camp-fire shed a red glow around, and the stillness was only too mournfully interrupted by the groans of wounded and dying men, who, not many hours before, had been full of health and hope. </p>

<p>About <time value="10am">10 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>It was, indeed, a sad and cruel spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Death had raged fearfully in many places, especially where our troops had been compelled to storm the strong intrenchments of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>On some of these perilous slopes the dead bodies might be seen piled <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>I was struck here by the piteous contrast presented by the bodies of <num value="2">two</num> of our dead which were lying side by side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>I can never forget the sight; I can see them now-<num value="1">one</num> a man of more than <num value="50">fifty</num>, who had been shot through the head, and whose silvery white hair was dabbled in his blood; the other, next to him, a lad of <num value="16">sixteen</num>, whose frank face was lighted up by clustering fair hair, and whose small hands were crossed over his heart, where the enemy's bullet had struck him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Among <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s men on the previous day I had looked with astonishment at a soldier from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>--a perfect giant, whose appearance had attracted the more attention from a vest of bear-skin that he wore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Here among the dead I found him again, with a small hole in the breast, which had been sufficient to make an end at once of all his strength and vigour. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Many stories had been recited in camp about a tremendous bayonet-fight, hand to hand, during the battle, between our Texans and the <orgName type="mil" key="NYZouaveVolunteer">New York Zouaves</orgName>, and it was said that <num value="2">two</num> of these determined antagonists had pierced each other through and through with their formidable and fatal weapons, and that their dead bodies had been found standing erect in the very attitude in which each had received his deathwound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Curiosity carried me to the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>An obstinate struggle had indeed taken place there between the troops named, which had ended in the utter annihilation of the much-vaunted Zouaves, whose bodies, dressed in flashy red <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> uniforms, were scattered about all over the ground like the scarlet poppies in a corn-field; but the never-erring bullet of the famous <placeName reg="Texan">Texan</placeName> marksmen had brought them down, not the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>I carefully examined many of the corpses, and found only <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> with bayonet-wounds, and these had been received evidently after the bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>These accounts of bayonet-fights are current after every general engagement, and are frequently embodied in subsequent <quote>histories,</quote> so called; but as far as my experience goes, recalling all the battles in which I have borne a part, bayonet-fights rarely if ever occur, and exist only in the imagination. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>About mid-day I returned to our encampment, where I found, to my great delight, a fresh horse that <persName n="Fitzhugh,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0004.00045.00124" reg="mostcommon:Fitzhugh,Norman,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Fitzhugh</surname></persName> had procured for me, and a company of our cavalry which was just starting to join our comrades at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>As the officer in command pretended to know the way very well, I made up my mind at once to join them; and after a march of more than <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure>, discovered, to my intense disgust, that the captain had missed his road completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>As night was now approaching, and squads of the enemy's cavalry were reported in every direction, nothing was left to us but to return to our starting-point, which we reached again about midnight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>During our march back to camp, passing <num value="1">one</num> of our picket-posts, we found our men there in great excitement, and were informed by them that the enemy had poisoned all the wells and springs in the neighbourhood, in consequence of which several of their number were in a dying condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/><num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num>, indeed, were very bad; but although I do not love the <rs>Yankees</rs>, I am quite sure they were entirely innocent <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The sufferers had been made ill by the too abundant use of bad <rs n="apple brandy" type="product">apple-brandy</rs>, which will kill anybody. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> streak of day of the <num value="29" type="ordinal">29th</num> found us once more in the saddle, marching gaily along through the dense green forests of oak and hickory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The distant thunder of cannon soon announced to us that the fight had opened; but eagerly as we pushed our horses, it was nearly <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> when we reached a plateau about <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> from the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName></placeName>, only to learn that the battle was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>This wide verdant flat was covered with <num value="1000">thousands</num> of tents and storehouses, and formed the main depot of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, numbering, before the late battles, at least <num value="150000">150,000</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>All over the field our horsemen were busy as ants, here rescuing from destruction quantities of valuable provisions, there enjoying luxuries of which they had long been deprived, that were scattered in the greatest profusion on every hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Ice, lemons, <rs n="crushed sugar" type="product">crushed sugar</rs>, and many other dainties and delicacies, which we knew only by <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> recollection, were heaped around us in large piles, for the benefit of any <num value="1">one</num> who would reach out his hand to take them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The General was in excellent spirits, and received me most cordially, losing no time in recounting to me the splendid results of his expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>He had broken the enemy's cavalry by his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack, taken many prisoners, captured untold wealth of spoil, and, what amused and delighted him most of all, disabled and driven off a Federal gunboat by the fire of his dismounted sharpshooters and <num value="2">two</num> pieces of <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse-artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>After a few minutes' rest, my curiosity led me through the burning encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Hundreds of boxes of oranges and lemons were piled up together, many of which, broken, sent the golden fruit rolling all over the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Great pyramids of barrels of white and <rs n="brown sugar" type="product">brown sugar</rs>, and of salt fish, and eggs packed in salt, were blazing on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/><num value="1">One</num> of the burning barrels of eggs we knocked open, and found its contents roasted <hi rend="italics">a merveille</hi>, which gave us, with other edibles within easy reach, such a repast as we had not enjoyed for many months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>A large number of railway carriages and new locomotive engines, and a pontoon train, also fell into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>In strolling through the more distant camps, I had the good fortune to secure a fine horse which had been left behind by his Federal owner in the hurry of his departure; but I lost my prize very soon afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>I set a guard over the corpse to protect it from casual injury, and it was soon afterwards delivered to the relatives of the deceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>The report was circulated in camp, and obtained some credence, that it was <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>French</rs> princes of the <name>Orleans</name> family, who were then serving on the <rs>Staff</rs> of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00048.00132" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, and had taken part in the recent engagements; but this story was never believed by <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0004.00048.00133" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> or myself. </p>

That we might regain the main body as speedily as possible, we marched for the remainder of the day without stopping in the hot sun, and encamped at nightfall upon the exact spot on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> where, a few weeks before, we had made so narrow an escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>At daybreak next morning we received orders to move as rapidly as we might <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> higher up the river, to ford it in the neighbourhood of <placeName reg="Bottom's Bridge">Bottom's Bridge</placeName>, and, falling upon the flank of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, to intercept its hasty retreat; but upon reaching this point we received counter orders, as the <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> Federal army had already passed, and we rode back in full gallop to <placeName reg="Forge Bridge">Forge Bridge</placeName>, our starting-point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Here we found that the enemy, anticipating our movement, had posted artillery and sharpshooters in advantageous position on the river-bank, and we were accordingly received with a very determined resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The sun was now pouring down with intense fervour, and as our horses were wellnigh exhausted with our rapid marching and counter-marching, we were compelled to take a few hours' rest on the roadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>We lay down in a corner of the fence beneath the shade of some cherry-trees hanging full of their delicious fruit, the bunches unfortunately just a little too high to serve our parched mouths with grateful refreshment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Without hesitation I jumped from my elevated position, grasping the higher part of the trunk, and breaking down the tree, amid the loud cheers and laughter of the <rs>Staff</rs> and the soldiers around, who finished the spoil, now so easily to be gathered, in an incredibly short time. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>In the midst of our mirth over the fallen cherry-tree, we were interrupted by the heavy boom of artillery brought to us from the heights of <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>, where a sanguinary battle had just begun, and we were again ordered into the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Hundreds of the largest trees were riven and shattered, and lay in fragments around, as if all the thunderbolts of heaven had been hurled against them; and in many places the fallen trunks and branches barricaded the road so that it was difficult to get along at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Having been detained by some duty at headquarters, I left about an hour later than the column, quite alone, and had on my ride a little adventure which gave rise to a great deal of merriment at my expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Suddenly, through the profound stillness of the night, there struck upon my quick ear the sound of hoofs upon my right hand, and out of a small dark bridle-path on the side of the road there emerged a horseman, who wore, as well as I could distinguish, the <rs>Federal</rs> uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/><quote>Halt!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>He entertained me on the way with many stories about the <rs>Yankee</rs> army, how long he had served in it, &amp;c. &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>As he made this recital, not without a certain latent satire at my prowess in making a prisoner of a private of the <orgName type="regiment" key="9VACav">9th Virginia Cavalry</orgName>, I confess that, recalling his extreme terror at the moment of his surrender, I lost all patience with him, and again levelling my pistol at him, I gave him to understand that I would make short work of him at any future repetition of his jests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>This substitution of dress <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> was unfortunately very often done by our men, and many a poor fellow has been killed by his own friends because he could not resist the temptation of discarding his duty rags for a new blue coat and trousers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Orders were now given us to proceed immediately to the front and co-operate with <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0008.0006.00082.00247" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:5"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in the event of any further extensive operations being attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>The firing of the morning we soon found to have been nothing more than an artillery duel between some of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s guns and the <rs>Federal</rs> batteries, from which the latter withdrew after <num value="1">one</num> of their caissons had been exploded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>This we found readily enough, on a commanding hill in the midst of a corn-field, as we met with no resistance, and saw only a few squads of cavalry afar off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>The spot where the caisson had been blown up was covered with dead and wounded men, and muskets and all sorts of equipments lay around, which had been thrown away by the supporting force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>As this had consisted of new levies, the men had been demoralised by our well-directed fire, and fled in utter stampede upon the <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> explosion of an ammunition-chest in the very midst of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Scarcely had our rifle pieces been put in position, when there came in sight a considerable force of the enemy's cavalry, which was held in check only by the accurate aim and rapid service of our gunners, and the bold advance of the <orgName type="regiment" key="5VACav">5th Virginia Cavalry</orgName> under <persName n="Rosser,Colonel,,,," id="n0008.0006.00083.00248" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName> on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>We very soon discovered, however, that just now the enemy was disinclined to allow any further proceedings on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Several batteries from different points opened upon us, and a large body of infantry made its appearance, throwing forward at double-quick <num value="2">two</num> lines of skirmishers in excellent order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>The enemy's artillery was soon engaged in a brisk duel with our <num value="2">two</num> batteries of <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse-artillery</orgName>, which suffered severely, losing many men and horses, in consequence of the superior positions and greater weight of metal of their antagonists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>About <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> we were relieved by <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s batteries, and, withdrawing from the field without the knowledge of the enemy, proceeded in rapid trot <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> higher up the river to <placeName reg="Waterloo Bridge">Waterloo Bridge</placeName>, where we crossed it, and continued our march to <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Late in the evening we entered this little town, and were received with the liveliest demonstrations of joy by the inhabitants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>We were now again exactly in the rear of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of which we had marched round; and our bold design was nothing less than to capture the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> and his headquarters, which, as our scouts reported, had been established at <placeName reg="Catlett's Station">Catlett's Station</placeName>, a point on the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>After an hour's rest to feed our horses, we left <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> behind us, continuing our march with great caution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Night was now rapidly approaching, and the angry clouds, which had been gathering in the sky throughout the afternoon, soon burst upon us in a tremendous thunderstorm and the heaviest rain I ever witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/><pb id="p.86" n="86"/> The narrow roads became in a short time running streams of water, and the little creeks on our route foamed and raged like mountain torrents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>But this was the very condition of the elements we could most have desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>The enemy's pickets, in the fury of the storm, indifferent to everything but their own personal comfort, were picked up, <num value="1">one</num> after another, by our advanced-guard to the last man, and we had thus arrived within the immediate neighbourhood of the main body of the enemy without the least information on their part of our approach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>Having been sent back by <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0006.00086.00255" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> with some orders to the rear of our column, I had, on my return, a very amusing adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>In passing <num value="1">one</num> of the farmhouses on the road, my sharp eye discovered, behind the curtains of <num value="1">one</num> of the windows, a Federal officer, who disappeared on my approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Instantly dismounting, I knocked at the door, ordering it to be opened at once; but instead of this, I heard tables and chairs moved hurriedly against it, which so much provoked me that I threw my whole weight upon the light frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>The door gave way with a loud crash, and hurled my <persName n="Yankee,,,,," id="n0008.0006.00086.00256" reg="mostcommon:Yankee,nomatch:0"><surname>Yankee</surname></persName>, with all his chair-and-table fortifications, over upon the floor of the little parlour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Before I could lay hands upon the poor fellow-who, being unarmed, and seeing himself at the mercy of so powerful-looking an adversary, had risen from his humiliating position with the drollest expression of extreme terror on his face &mdash; a very pretty young woman came out of the adjoining room, bearing a waiter in her hands with a bottle of wine and other refreshments, which she offered me in the most graceful manner possible, placing herself at the same time between me and my victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Tactics like these were so novel to me that for a moment I quite lost my selfpossession; <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> but, very soon recovering my wits, I thanked her politely for her hospitality, which I should be very ready to accept after I had done my duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>But approaching again and again my prisoner, I encountered again and again this charming obstacle, so that we played for a good while the juvenile game of fox-and-goose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>The scene of action had in the mean time shifted towards a broad door-like window, which opened upon the garden side, and from the gathering darkness, and its proximity to the surrounding forest, afforded a very fair opportunity of escape; so seeing no other way of bringing the interview to a satisfactory conclusion, I levelled my pistol at the officer's breast, and said, <quote><rs type="role2">Madam</rs>, if you cannot bear separation from the enemy of your country, I will leave him with you, but not alive.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>This had the desired effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>The fair creature abandoned her position, and in the midst of her bitter tears and pathetic appealings, which my sense of duty alone enabled me to resist, I bore my prisoner off. He was a handsome young man, a lieutenant in an infantry regiment, and had contracted an engagement of marriage with his protectress before the war commenced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The rain was still pouring in torrents at <time value="11pm">eleven P. M.</time>, when we came directly upon the <rs>Federal</rs> encampment, which extended about a mile in length on either side of the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>We halted at the distance of about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> to form our long lines and make our dispositions, which we accomplished without attracting the notice of our adversaries in the heavy rain and amid the incessantly-rolling thunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>The sound of a single trumpet was the signal for nearly <num value="2000">2000</num> horsemen to dash, as they did with loud shouts, upon the utterly paralysed <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, who were cut down and made prisoners before they had recovered from their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>I myself had instructions to proceed with a select body of men to <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0008.0006.00087.00257" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s tent, which was pointed out to us by a negro whom we had captured during the day, and who had <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> been <quote>impressed</quote> by <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0008.0006.00088.00258" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s staff-officers as a servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Unfortunately for us, the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> had, for once, this day his <quote>headquarters in the saddle</quote> --an intention which he had so boastfully announced at the commencement of his campaign-and had started a few hours before our arrival on a reconnaissance, so that we found only his private baggage, official papers, horses, &amp;c. &amp;c. I obtained as booty a magnificent field-glass, which was afterwards of great service to me. The scene had become in the mean time a most exciting <num value="1">one</num>, and the confusion, which is always the consequence of a night attack, had reached its highest point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>The Federal troops on the other side of the railroad, which was not so easily accessible, had recovered from their panic, and, reinforced by some companies of the so-called Bucktail Rifles, commenced a vigorous fire upon our men, who were scattered all over the field burning and plundering to their hearts' content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>In the background our reserves were actively employed in firing the immense depots and waggon-trains and the railway bridge; and the flames, rising from a <num value="100">hundred</num> different points at once, reddened the dark cloudy night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>It was difficult to recognise friend or foe.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Having received orders from <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0006.00088.00259" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to cut the telegraph wire, I proceeded with <num value="20">twenty</num> men to the execution of this purpose; but just as we had reached a pole, I saw suddenly, by the vivid illumination of a flash of lightning, a whole company of the enemy drawn up in line not <num value="15">fifteen</num> steps from us; and I had just time to call out to my men to lie down, when a rattling volley sent a shower of bullets over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>I galloped back to the <rs>General</rs> asking for a squadron to assist me in carrying out his orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>The squadron was <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> immediately granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>But they still maintained a rapid fusillade, and to climb the pole and cut the wire was a very dangerous undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>A young fellow of not more than <num value="17">seventeen</num> volunteered to perform the daring feat, and, using my shoulders as a starting-point, he ran up the pole with the agility of a squirrel; the wire, severed by a stroke of his sabre, was soon dangling to the ground; and the brave boy escaped unhurt, several bullets, however, having struck the pole during his occupation of it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>About <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the morning the work of destruction at <placeName reg="Catlett's Station">Catlett's Station</placeName> was complete, and the order was given to re-form and start upon our return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>The alarm had been spread over a great part of the <rs>Federal</rs> wing, and troops were marching against us from several directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>Our success, in spite of the great confusion of the midnight attack, had been very decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>We had killed and wounded a great number of the enemy; <measure n="400" type="captured">captured 400</measure> prisoners, among whom were several officers, and more than <num value="500">500</num> horses; destroyed several <num value="100">hundred</num> tents, large supply-depots, and long waggon-trains; secured, in the possession of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> of <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0008.0006.00089.00261" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>, <measure n="500000dollars" type="currency">500,000 dollars</measure> in greenbacks, and <num value="20000">20,000</num> in gold; and, most important of all, had deprived the <rs>Federal</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Commander">Commander</rs> of all his baggage and private and official papers, exposing to us the effective strength of his army, the disposition of his different <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>, and the plans of his whole campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Our loss was comparatively small; and after a rapid march, impeded only by the deluge of water still pouring down upon us, and compelling us to swim several creeks which were ordinarily but a few inches in depth, we reached <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, with all our prisoners and booty, at <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> the following morning. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>Wet by the rain of <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure>, and chilled by the sharp air of the morning, we found grateful reinvigoration in the viands that were offered us by the kind citizens of the place, who heard with the greatest delight of the success of our expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>I was enjoying some delicious coffee, served by the fair hands of a lovely and accomplished young girl, whose acquaintance I had made the previous day, when, hearing that we had taken <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0008.0006.00090.00262" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s Quartermaster, she laughed heartily, and told us that when he had been quartered at her father's house a few days before, he had, in boasting of the magnificent <orgName>army of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0008.0006.00090.00263" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName></orgName>, declared his intention of entering <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> before the end of the month, and that she had made him a bet of a bottle of champagne that he would not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>The glowing radiance of the sun breaking at last through the parting <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> clouds brought life and cheer to our drenched and chilled column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>About <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> we reached the scene of action, where there had been only a <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>-fight, and not, as we had supposed, a general engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Our pursuers having stopped at <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, we had therefore a short period of welcome inactivity, and the orders to dismount and feed the horses were received with pleasure by every man of our fatigued command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>As soon as I had taken the proper care of my horse, and emptied my long cavalry boots of several quarts of water they contained, I fell fast asleep in the shade of a gigantic hickory-tree, from which refreshing slumber I was suddenly aroused some hours later by a spirited cannonade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The enemy were advancing, and the guns of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Robertson,,,,," id="n0008.0006.00091.00266" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> had engaged a Federal battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>The position of a senior staff-officer in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> was a very important and responsible <num value="1">one</num>, and <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0006.00092.00269" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> had given me instructions, in his absence, to issue any necessary commands in his name; so I immediately despatched a courier to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of the nearest regiment, the <orgName type="regiment" key="7VACav">7th Virginia Cavalry</orgName>, with orders for him to proceed with all haste to the river, and post his men as dismounted sharpshooters on the woody cliffs on both sides of the bridge; and galloping myself after our artillery, which had marched some distance to the rear, and taking back with me the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> pieces I fell in with, I arrived at the bridge just in time to receive the dense column of the approaching Federals with a destructive fire of canister from my light howitzers, which for a little while effectually checked their advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>It was not long, however, before they threw their skirmishers forward, and a brisk fusillade was rattling along the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>The fight now became more and more general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>The enemy brought several brigades of infantry into action, and opened upon us with several new batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>In the mean time all the guns of our <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse-artillery</orgName> had arrived upon the ground, and were pouring their deadly missiles into the <rs>Federal</rs> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Twice did the <rs>Yankees</rs> succeed in setting fire to the bridge with incendiary shell, but the flames were instantly extinguished by our gallant men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>As these were contained in solid iron safes, of which the key had been lost, it was not the easiest matter in the world to get at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>It was thought, however, a profitable employment of our earliest leisure to investigate <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0008.0006.00093.00273" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s sub-treasury, and our men had been hammering away at the safes for some time without result, when <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0006.00093.00274" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> turned round to me and said, laughingly, <quote>If nobody can open these strong boxes, we must call on <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Armstrong,Major,,,," id="n0008.0006.00093.00275" reg="mostcommon:Armstrong,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Armstrong</surname></persName></hi> (a nickname he had given me) to assist us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Accepting the banter at once, I delivered a few heavy blows upon the safes with a serviceable axe, which laid them open, amid the loud cheers of our soldiers, who, with their accustomed idle curiosity, had formed a large circle round us. <measure n="2boxes" type="mass">Two boxes</measure> of excellent cigars, which the <rs>Yankee Quartermaster</rs> had kept in this place of security, doubtless as the <name>Cockney</name> at the <rs>French</rs> custom-house expressed it, <quote>pour fumigation luimeme,</quote> fell to me as my share of the spoil &mdash; a great luxury indeed, to <num value="1">one</num> who had long been deprived of the aromatic <rs>Havana</rs> weed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>There was a good deal of merriment among the young staff-officers at headquarters concerning <num value="1">one</num> of our <placeName reg="Catlett's Station">Catlett's Station</placeName> prisoners, whom I had taken over with me under charge of a courier for further instructions-and who, just as we were sending off the main body of these prisoners to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, had been discovered to be a good-looking woman in full Federal uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>The different boxes were speedily opened by my sword, and were found to contain shirts, hats, pockethandkerchiefs, oranges, lemons, wines, cigars, and all sorts of knick-knacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>About <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the afternoon there was a heavy cannonade and continuous musketry-fire heard in the direction of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s position, announcing that the enemy had commenced their attack; but, at the same time, we heard a cannonade in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2112188" n="1.000 9" reg="haymarket, prince william, virginia">Haymarket</placeName>, and believing <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0006.00100.00291" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to be there at work, I regarded it as my duty to continue my march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Very soon, however, we heard firing all around us, and I was convinced that we had been misled by the sound, and the great number of narrow unfrequented bridle-paths in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>As it was impossible to decide where we should find friend or foe, our situation became a very critical <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>About dusk we discovered in a small opening before us a negro on horseback, who had no sooner seen us than he galloped off in hurried flight, but was overtaken after a short chase by <num value="1">one</num> of our couriers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Being perfectly at a loss, and nearly cut off from our army on all sides, I resolved to attempt returning by the same route we had come, and, protected by the darkness of the fast-coming night, to endeavour to rejoin <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>Strange to relate, the old gentleman had sustained not the slightest injury, and could complain of nothing beyond the somewhat rude manner in which he had been tossed upon the floor. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>The banks of this noble river, which is of great width at this point, rise to the height of about <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure> above the bed of the stream, and are overshadowed by gigantic trees of primeval growth, the trunks and branches of which are enwrapped with luxuriant vines, that, after reaching the very top, fall in graceful streamers and festoons to the ground, thus presenting tangles of tender verdure rarely seen in the forests of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>It was, indeed, a magnificent sight as the long column of many <num value="1000">thousand</num> horsemen stretched across this beautiful Potomac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>The evening sun slanted upon its clear placid waters, and burnished them with gold, while the arms of the soldiers glittered and blazed in its radiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>The passage of the <rs>Potomac</rs> by the column occupied about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, and was attended with some difficulty to our artillery, as the water in many places rose quite up to the middle of the horses' bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Having safely accomplished it, we continued our march towards the little town of <placeName reg="Poolesville, Montgomery, Maryland" key="tgn,2048336">Poolesville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>The inhabitants of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> whom we met along the road, with some exceptions, did not greet us quite so cordially as we had expected, this portion of the state being less devoted than others to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>The wildest and absurdest questions were eagerly asked by the honest burghers concerning the strength of our armies, our intended movements, &amp;c. &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>They buy everything, and embarrass themselves with numberless articles which very soon afterwards are thrown away as useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>I myself could not resist the temptation of purchasing a box of cigars, a parcel of white <rs n="crushed sugar" type="product">crushed sugar</rs>, some lemons, and a pocket-knife, in the possession of which treasures I felt as happy as a king. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>A small detachment was immediately sent after these industrious fellows, and speedily returned, bringing with them several officers and men, and an entire apparatus of beautiful instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>We entered <placeName reg="Urbana, Champaign, Ohio" key="tgn,2082329">Urbana</placeName> about noon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>The simple arrangements for our headquarters were quickly made, a few tents were <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> pitched in the garden of a modest dwelling in the very centre of the village, the horses were picketed around, and in a few minutes the smoke rising from a dozen or more camp-fires gave pleasing assurance that the negroes were busy with their kettles in the occupation of all others most suited to their genius and temper &mdash; the preparation of dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>Unfortunately, I could not wait to profit by the results of their culinary talent, and before my comrades of the <rs>Staff</rs> had commenced their meal I was trotting along the broad turnpike towards <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>At the point where the road sweeps suddenly down from a higher elevation to the vale of the <rs>Monocacy</rs> the view is really grand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>Well-tilled fields stretch away for miles to purple ranges of mountains in the far distance; in the middle of the plain lies the city, with its domes and steeples, and in the intermediate space flows the brawling, limpid stream of the <rs>Monocacy</rs>, spanned by lofty bridges and the noble viaduct of the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railway</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>The <rs>Unionists</rs> living there had their houses closely shut up and barred; but the far greater number of the citizens, being favourably disposed to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, had thrown wide open their doors and windows, and welcomed our troops with the liveliest enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>Flags were floating from the houses, and garlands of flowers were hung across the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>Everywhere a dense multitude was moving up and down, singing and shouting in a paroxysm of joy and patriotic emotion, in many cases partly superinduced by an abundant flow of strong liquors. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>This disclaimer, they said, was prompted by the well-known modesty of the great hero, and afforded them the surest means of recognising him. The complication grew worse every minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>To escape these annoying ovations I dismounted at last at a hotel, but here I was little better off. It was like jumping into the mill-pond to get out of the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>In the agreeable conversation of these ladies, in mirth and song, the afternoon of our dinner-party passed lightly and rapidly away; and then came night, queenly and beautiful, with a round moon, whose beams penetrating the windows suggested to our debonnair commander a promenade, which he at once proposed, and which was carried <hi rend="italics">nem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>This building had <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> been occupied before the breaking out of the war as an academy, but was now entirely deserted and dismantled, and our footsteps echoed loudly as we walked through its wide, empty halls, once so noisy with human voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>Each storey of the house had its ample verandah running round it, and from the highest of these we had a magnificent view of the village and the surrounding country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>The night was calm, the dark blue firmament was besprinkled with myriads of stars, and the moon poured over the landscape a misty bluish light that made it all look unreal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>To this there was a unanimous response in the affirmative, which was especially hearty on the part of the ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>It was at once agreed that the ball should be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>I undertook to make all necessary arrangements for the illumination and decoration of the hall, the issuing the cards of invitation, &amp;c., leaving to <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0007.00135.00421" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> the matter of the music, which he gladly consented to provide. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>A soldier's life is so uncertain, and his time is so little at his own disposal, that in affairs of this sort delays are always to be avoided; and so we determined on our way home, to the great joy of our fair companions, that the ball should come off on the following evening. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>Very soon the sound of distant bugles announced the coming of the band of the <orgName type="regiment" key="18MSInfantry">18th Mississippi Infantry</orgName>, the <rs>Colonel</rs> and Staff of the regiment, who had been invited as an act of courtesy, leading the way, and the band playing in excellent style the well-known air of Dixie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>Amid the loud applause of the numerous invited and uninvited guests, we now made our grand <hi rend="italics">entree</hi> into the large hall, which was brilliantly lighted with <rs n="tallow candles" type="product">tallow candles</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>As master of the ceremonies, it was my office to arrange the order of the different dances, and I had decided upon a polka as the best for an animated beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>Not to be baffled, however, I at once ordered the time of the music to be changed, and had soon forgotten my disappointment as to the polka in a very lively quadrille.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>Louder and louder sounded the instruments, quicker and quicker moved the dancers, and the whole crowded room, with its many exceedingly pretty women and <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> its martial figures of officers in their best uniforms, presented a most striking spectacle of gaiety and enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>Suddenly enters an orderly covered with dust, and reports in a loud voice to <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0007.00137.00422" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> that the enemy have surprised and driven in our pickets and are attacking our camp in force, while at the same moment the sound of shots in rapid succession is distinctly borne to us on the midnight air. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>The excitement which followed this announcement I cannot undertake to describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>The music crashed into <hi rend="italics">a concordia discors</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>They were pursued in their headlong flight for several miles by the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC1">1st North Carolina</orgName>, until, a little past midnight, they got quite out of reach, and all was quiet again. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>At this time the ambulances laden with the wounded of last night's engagement were slowly approaching the <name>Academy</name>, as the only building at <placeName reg="Urbana, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,2049051">Urbana</placeName> that was at all suited to the purposes of an hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>Of course the music was immediately stopped and the dancing ceased, and our lovely partners in the quadrille at once became <quote>ministering angels</quote> to the sufferers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>This she did bravely and tenderly, until the wounded man, greatly relieved by her ministrations, expressed his gratitude with tears streaming from his eyes, and begged her now to take care of herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>The sun was high in the heavens when we rose from our camp pallets the following day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty was to send back to the respective regiments their battle-flags, and I made all haste to discharge it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>The General soon arrived upon the spot and gave orders for the withdrawal of the mountain howitzer; but as he had not seen the lines of the advancing infantry skirmishers, who had already disappeared in the thick underwood below us, he did not share in my opinion as to the danger of our situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>The firing of small-arms now became louder and louder on our right, and seemed to proceed from a point even a little to the rear of the place we occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs>, knowing very well that there was a noble game afoot, now advanced their whole line at a run, and with loud cries of encouragement, towards an open space over which we must ride, and where a shower of bullets fell around us, fortunately without touching a rider or a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>The order for our general retreat was now given, and executed at a quick trot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>I expected every moment to hear the roar of the <rs>Yankee</rs> artillery, which from the heights behind us must have inflicted very serious loss upon our column; but <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0008.0007.00146.00456" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, with admirable foresight, had so well barricaded the roads that we were out of range before they had gained our former position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>The fight was <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> soon recommenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>The thunder of cannon roared incessantly, and as the enemy's guns had now the advantage of more favourable positions, which admitted of their being effectively employed in yet greater number, we suffered severely from their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>At the same time the wings of the <rs>Yankee</rs> army, thrown rapidly forward, overlapped us on either flank, and our brave North Carolinians were thus subjected to a most destructive cross-fire before <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0007.00147.00459" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> gave the order for retreat, which, in consequence of the murderous tempest of shot and shell that raged around them, was not conducted in a very orderly manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>I was <num value="1">one</num> of the last horsemen that galloped through the town, and had a painfully accurate sight of the confusion and destruction that attended the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>The hotly-pursuing enemy were now received upon the opposite bank with a deadly fire from our well-posted sharpshooters, and showers of canister from our artillery, which brought them to a stop; and after a heavy cannonade that lasted for more than an hour, we continued our retreat quietly towards the <rs type="place">South Mountain</rs>, in the direction of <placeName reg="Boonsboroa">Boonsboroa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>Accordingly, we had scarcely fallen asleep when the order was given to mount, and we commenced our rapid march through the chill fog of the morning, cold, hungry, and wet to the skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>But a few hours of hard riding, the genial warmth of the sun breaking through the watery sky, and more than all else, a luxurious breakfast, which was quickly prepared for us at a hospitable house on the roadside, the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Regular">first regular</orgName> meal that we had enjoyed for many days, revived and refreshed us. About noon we reached the <rs>Potomac</rs> opposite <placeName reg="Williamsport, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7016329">Williamsport</placeName>, forded the river, and drove a <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> squadron of Federal cavalry stationed there out of the place towards <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName>, a village some <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles distant</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>The intrenchment was concealed from view by a slight elevation of ground about <num value="40">forty</num> steps in front of it, so that the <rs>Yankees</rs> came upon it quite unexpectedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>The infantry officer in command had given orders to his men to reserve their fire till the last moment, and the dense ranks of the horsemen had arrived within close range when suddenly the volley thundered upon them, making them turn and fly precipitately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>Having been myself with the infantry, I galloped forward, believing that at least half of the assailants had been brought to the ground, but found to my surprise that not a man or a horse had been struck down, the leaden hail having passed far above their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>On several subsequent occasions I had a similar experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>The haste and uncertainty of volleyfiring, even with the improved firearms now in use, made it possible in a few cases for our cavalry successfully to attack and ride down unbroken infantry &mdash; an attempt which, with accurate dropping fire, I regard as out of the question. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>During <num value="1">one</num> of the pauses of the fight, when the enemy had retired some distance, <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0008.00170.00563" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> requested me to reconnoitre their position and further movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>Having done <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> this closely, I sent my report by an orderly I had taken with me, and was riding slowly along the turnpike on my return, when I passed a modest-looking farmhouse, in the garden of which was a trellis of such superb grapes that I could not resist asking of the proprietor, who stood in his doorway, permission to pluck some of the branches which hung in such tempting profusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>The request was not only granted at once, but the hospitable farmer invited me to alight and join him at dinner, which was just about to be served.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>As everything now seemed perfectly quiet, and the enemy nowhere at hand, I did not think it imprudent to accept his kind offer, otherwise so entirely consistent with my inclination; so tying my horse to the garden-gate, about <num value="20">twenty</num> steps from the building, I entered the drawing-room, which was already pervaded by the appetising smell of the coming meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>The farmer's wife, seeing some ugly rents in my dilapidated uniform coat, kindly proposed to mend them for me, and, waiving the etiquette of a major remaining in her presence in his shirt-sleeves, had just commenced her task, when I heard the heavy clatter of hoofs on the turnpike, and saw, at the same moment, a whole squadron of <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> approaching at a full gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>At this critical moment, a couple of shells from <num value="2">two</num> of our guns, which had been put in position on an acclivity commanding the turnpike, a mile off, whizzed close over my head, and with admirable aim exploded in the very midst of the advancing foe, emptying several saddles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>Their onset and the terrible effect of our artillery made the <rs>Yankees</rs> wheel and run much faster than they had come; and thus was saved my life and liberty, coat and dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>Passing the farmhouse on my return, the excellent mistress of the establishment, with a pleasant smile upon her honest face, handed me across the garden-gate my repaired garment, saying that she had kept my dinner for me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>The increasing darkness also interfered much with the celerity of our movements; but the indefatigable <rs>Stuart</rs>, leading everywhere in person, carried his men forward again <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> and again, driving the enemy through <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName> into the waves of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>The <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName> of the <rs>Federals</rs> was, by a determined attack at the last moment, completely dispersed; but, protected by the intense darkness of the night, most of the men made their escape, and only <measure n="30" type="prisoners">thirty prisoners</measure> fell into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>But the killed and wounded of the <rs>Federals</rs> must have reached a large figure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>On our return through <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName>, we stopped for an hour at the house of a lady, a friend of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00193.00661" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Mrs</rs> L., who had lost her husband, <num value="1">one</num> of his former classmates, at the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>To her and her sisters I was presented; at a later period I became well acquainted with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>The General's presence was no sooner known in the village than a mob of young and pretty girls collected at <rs type="role">Mrs</rs> L.&lsquo;s house, all very much excited &mdash; to such an extent, indeed, that the <rs>General</rs>'s uniform was in a few minutes entirely shorn of its buttons, taken as souvenirs; and if he had given as many locks of his hair as were asked for, our commander would soon have been totally bald.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0009.00193.00662" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> suffered all this very gracefully, with the greater resignation as every <num value="1">one</num> of these patriotic young ladies gave him a kiss as tribute and reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>This latter favour was unhappily not extended to the Staff-officers, and it may be readily imagined that it was tantalising for us to look on and not take part in the pleasant ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>We arrived at <quote>The <address><street n="Bower street">Bower</street></address></quote> at a late hour of the night, but found our kind host yet awake, the excitement and anxiety of the day having prevented him from retiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>Here we obtained compensation for the loss of our dinner in an abundant supply of cold meat, and cut into a capital <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> ham with a greater amount of destruction than we had done during the day into the ranks of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>The following day there came some important documents and letters from <persName n="Lee,General,R.,E.,," id="n0008.0009.00193.00663" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to be transmitted to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00193.00664" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, and I had the honour to be selected by <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> our commander-in-chief as the bearer of them into the <rs>Federal</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>To make a favourable impression upon <quote>our friends the enemy,</quote> I fitted myself out as handsomely as the very seedy condition of my wardrobe would allow; and as all my own horses were, more or less, broken-down, I borrowed a high-stepping, fine-limbed chestnut from <num value="1">one</num> of my comrades of the <rs>Staff</rs> for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/><persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00194.00665" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> took advantage of the opportunity to send under my charge a batch of prisoners for exchange, and, intrusting me with some private messages to <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0008.0009.00194.00666" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, bade me proceed as far as possible into the enemy's lines, and employ all my diplomacy to obtain a large insight into his positions &mdash; to as great an extent, at least, as was consistent with the proprieties of my mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>About <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> in the morning, my <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> <name>Yankee</name> prisoners were turned over to me by <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> W.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>This imposing ensign consisted of a white pocket-handkerchief on a long pole, and was borne most loftily by <num value="1">one</num> of our couriers, a handsome martial-looking fellow, who crossed the river with it, and soon brought me the permission to come to the opposite shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>I was greatly amused, during our passage of the ford, by the bitter complaints of the <rs>Yankee</rs> prisoners, that they were forced to wade through the cold waters of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, which wet them from head to foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>I answered them, that I was not myself unmoved by the cruel compulsion, and that I should be yet more deeply affected by it, had not all the boats along the river been seized and burned by their army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>On the <rs>Maryland</rs> shore I was received by a major, who was in command of the outposts at this part of the <rs>Federal</rs> lines, who handed me his proper written acknowledgment for the prisoners, and said, that as for the papers and documents I <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> might deliver them to him, and he would forward them at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>This, of course, I politely declined, giving him to understand that despatches of such importance I could only deliver to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00195.00668" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, or, should this be impossible, to some other general of his army; and adding, that as I supposed <persName n="Pleasanton,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00195.00669" reg="mostcommon:Pleasanton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pleasanton</surname></persName> to be supreme in command of this portion of the lines, I should be glad to be conducted to him. The <rs>Major</rs> here betrayed some embarrassment, and spoke of impossibilities, &amp;c., but at last concluded to send off a mounted officer for further instructions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>Meanwhile all the <rs>Yankee</rs> soldiers who were not on duty came running towards me, impelled by curiosity to see the <quote>great big rebel officer,</quote> in such numbers that the <rs>Major</rs> was compelled to establish a cordon of sentries around me to keep them at a respectful distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>The only camp-stool that could be produced having been politely offered me for a seat, I soon found myself engaged in a lively and pleasant conversation with a group of Federal officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>Upon <num value="1">one</num> matter only that was brought into the discourse we were unable to agree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>They claimed the <rs n="Battle of Sharpsburg" type="battle">battle of Sharpsburg</rs> as a brilliant victory for their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>I could not see it in that light. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>At length, after a weary time of waiting, came the answer to the <rs>Major</rs>'s message that I might proceed; and a goodlooking young cavalry officer was reported to me as guide and protector.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>Eager to anticipate a disagreeable and awkward formality, I now asked to be blindfolded, but this was politely waived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>Starting from the ford, I took a tall and singularly shaped pine-tree, which reared itself far above the tops of its neighbours, as a landmark, and with this constantly in sight, it was not difficult for me to discover that I was purposely carried about in a circle, up hill and down dale, through dense woods and vast encampments of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>The Federal army at this time certainly appeared to the greatest advantage in its camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>Everywhere was observable <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> the most beautiful order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>The soldiers were well dressed, and had the look of being well fed; their arms were in excellent condition; and the whole of their cantonments spoke of a high degree of military discipline, the absence of which I had so often regretted in our own bivouacs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>My companion proved to be a very pleasant young gentleman but inexperienced officer, who, during a ride of <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure>, which brought us to somebody's headquarters, voluntarily gave me much information that he should have kept to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>Here I saw at a glance a considerable display of the pomp and circumstance of war. What a contrast it presented to the headquarters of our general officers, especially to the simple encampment of our great commander-in-chief, who, with his Staff and escort, occupied only a few small tents, scarcely to be distinguished from the tent of a lieutenant!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>Here a little town of canvass surrounded the magnificent marquee of the <rs>General</rs>, from which floated the stars and stripes in a reckless extravagance of bunting; numerous sentries were pacing their beats; mounted officers, resplendent with bullion, galloped to and fro; and <num value="2">two</num> regiments of Zouaves in their gaudy uniforms were drawn up for parade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>I had already found out that this was <placeName><persName n="Porter,General,Fitzjohn,,," id="n0008.0009.00196.00670" reg="default:Porter,Fitzjohn,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Fitzjohn</foreName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, and it was evident enough that some very great personage was expected there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>Adjoining the <rs>General</rs>'s marquee there had been erected a beautiful pavilion, under which was stretched out a long table laden with luxuries of every description, bottles of champagne in silver ice-coolers, a profusion of delicious fruit, and immense bouquets of flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>A balloon (I have mentioned before that this means of observation was much in use with the <rs>Federal</rs> army) was rising every few minutes to the height of several <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure>, the car, secured by ropes, filled with officers, who, with all kinds of glasses, were looking out narrowly in the direction of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>I was not mistaken in my <pb id="p.197" n="197"/> conjectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>As I afterwards learned, no less a dignitary than <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0008.0009.00197.00671" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was momentarily looked for.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>During the time my young companion was announcing my presence to <persName n="Porter,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00197.00673" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitzjohn,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, I directed my eye towards the river, and there stood my pine-tree, not more than <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles distant</measure> in a straight line, plainly in view. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>From <persName n="Porter,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00197.00674" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitzjohn,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s tent I could now hear the sound of voices in excited conversation; indeed, I caught several very angry expressions before my guide returned with a flushed face, in which <num value="1">one</num> could read plainly the reprimand that had been given him, and desired me to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/><persName n="Porter,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00197.00675" reg="nearbymention:Porter,Fitzjohn,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, as he rose to receive me, I found to be a man of rather above the middle height, with a frank and agreeable face, the lower part of which was covered with a luxuriant black beard, and in his whole bearing and appearance the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>The floor of his ample tent was carpeted, easy-chairs and a couch offered their accommodations, and his headquarters had all the comfort of a well-furnished drawing-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>After a brief interchange of salutations, ensued the following colloquy:-- </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>Unfortunately for my bag, my ambition led me to direct my attention chiefly to the wild turkey, which is by no means so easy to kill as I had imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>It differs very much from the domestic turkey, having a taller and slighter frame, with plumage of varied tints from a rich green to a darkish brown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>The meat is much darker and of more decided flavour than that of the domestic turkey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>The best way of getting a shot at them in the autumn is to call them, but a very good way is to hunt them with dogs, which must be trained for the purpose, and which, as soon as a flock has been started, disperse it and pursue the single birds so long and with such loud barking that they fly <pb id="p.203" n="203"/> in affright to the tree, where the sportsman finds it a simple matter to bring them down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>They fly only when pressed in this manner or when suddenly driven out of a thicket, but they run with the celerity of the greyhound, and are extremely wary and cunning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>Very near <quote>The <rs>Bower</rs>,</quote> on the opposite side of the <rs>Opequan</rs>, I had discovered a charming little valley, through which ran a sparkling rivulet, a tributary of the larger stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>In the ravine the richest grass grew abundantly, and alternated with little patches of thick undergrowth and groups of paw-paw trees, the banana-like fruit of which was just ripening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>On the immediate banks of the creek gigantic tulip-poplar, hickory, and walnut trees rose to an immense height, interlacing their branches so as to form a leafy arch over the sequestered glen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>I was also honoured with the pleasing mission of presenting to old <persName><foreName>Stonewall</foreName></persName>, as a slight token of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0009.00206.00711" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s high regard, a new and very <quote>stunning</quote> uniform coat, which had just arrived from the hands of a Richmond tailor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>The garment, neatly wrapped up, was borne on the pommel of his saddle by <num value="1">one</num> of our couriers who accompanied me; and starting at once I reached the simple tent of our great general just in time for dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>I found him in his old weather-stained coat, from which all the buttons had been clipped long since by the fair hands of patriotic ladies, and which, from exposure to sun and rain and powder-smoke, and by reason of many rents and patches, was in a very unseemly condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>When I had despatched more important matters, I produced <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0009.00206.00712" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s present, in all its magnificence of gilt buttons and sheeny facings and gold lace, and I was heartily amused at the modest confusion with which the hero of many battles regarded the fine uniform from many points of view, scarcely daring to touch it, and at the quiet way in which, at last, he folded it up carefully, and deposited it in his postmanteau, saying to me, <quote>Give <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0009.00206.00713" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> my best thanks, my dear Majorthe coat is much too handsome for me, but I shall take the best care of it, and shall prize it highly as a souvenir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>And now let us have some dinner.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>But I protested energetically against this summary disposition of the matter of the coat, deeming my mission, indeed, but half executed, and remarked that <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0009.00206.00714" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> would certainly ask me how the uniform fitted its owner, and that I should, therefore, take it as a personal favour if he would put it on. To this he readily assented with a smile, and having donned the garment, he escorted me <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> outside the tent to the table where dinner had been served in the open air. The whole of the <rs>Staff</rs> were in a perfect ecstasy at their chief's brilliant appearance, and the old negro servant, who was bearing the roast-turkey from the fire to the board, stopped in mid-career with a most bewildered expression, and gazed in wonderment at his master as if he had been transfigured before him. Meanwhile, the rumour of the change ran like electricity through the neighbouring camps, and the soldiers came running by hundreds to the spot, desirous of seeing their beloved <persName><foreName>Stonewall</foreName></persName> in his new attire; and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wearing of a fresh robe by <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>., at whose morning toilet all the world was accustomed to assemble, never created half the sensation at <placeName reg="Versailles, Woodford, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041781">Versailles</placeName>, that was made in the woods of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> by the investment of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName> in this new regulation uniform. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>This squadron had come from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, along a by-road which struck the turnpike at a point about midway between <placeName key="tgn,7013824" n="1.000 6" reg="kearneysville, jefferson, west virginia">Kearneysville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Middleway, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120000">Smithfield</placeName>, which point they had reached just <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> after <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0008.0010.00220.00774" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> with a very small escort had passed by. Our <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> had thus very narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the enemy, and I thought it necessary to despatch a courier at once to <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0010.00220.00775" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to inform him that the road was not clear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>During the afternoon the alarm was renewed, this time in the direction of <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>; but industriously as I endeavoured to discover the whereabouts of the <rs>Yankee</rs> infantry, who had been plainly seen advancing along the turnpike with glistening bayonets, and the dust rising on their line of march, I could obtain no trace of them whatever, after a ride of <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> towards their supposed quarter of approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>Late in the evening I received a report from <persName n="Jones,Colonel,,,," id="n0008.0010.00220.00776" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, now commanding <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Robertson,,,,," id="n0008.0010.00220.00777" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, that the hostile forces were retreating again towards <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, and that he hoped to be again in occupancy of <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName> even before his message could reach me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>Our supplies now began to fail in the country around <quote>The <rs>Bower</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>The partridges had grown exceedingly wild, and we were obliged, each in his turn, to make long excursions into the woods and fields to keep our mess-table furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>As all was quiet along our lines, we at once determined to attend the sale, so the horses were hitched to the yellow-painted waggon, and we were soon proceeding at a rapid trot over the rocky road, amid the loud outcries and bitter complaints of my gallant <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="5VACav">5th Virginia Cavalry</orgName>, who declared that he had never in his life experienced such joltings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>Arrived at the place of destination, we bought largely, making frequent trials and tastings of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> and blackberry wines, and returned to camp with our waggon well filled with stores of various kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>Among our purchases was an immense pot of lard, which we placed in the back part of the waggon, regarding it as an acquisition of great value for our camp biscuit-bakery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>We had not, however, counted on the melting influence of the sun upon the lard, and the consequences was that with every jolt of the waggon over the frequent stones in the road, the fluid mass sent its jets of grease in a fountain over the hams, potatoes, and apples that covered the bottom of the vehicle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>This annoyance, provoking as it was, little disturbed our temper, which had been somewhat mellowed by the frequent inhibitions of the country wine (in the way of tasting); and we continued our drive at a rattling pace, varying our discourse from the gay to the sentimental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>The following morning we received reports that the enemy in heavy force was advancing from <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName> in the direction of Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>Thither we marched at once, arriving just in time to occupy a naturally strong position about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> from the little village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>Scarcely had our artillery got ready for action, when the <rs>Yankees</rs> made their appearance, and there began a lively cannonade with spirited sharpshooting, the latter doing little damage to either party, as the high stone fences which enclose the fields in this part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> afforded protection to both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>The Federal cavalry being far superior in numbers to our own, and our scouts reporting the approach of a strong infantry force, whose glistening bayonets, indeed, we could already see in the far prospect, it seemed almost certain that, after some little resistance, we should be compelled to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs>, however, appeared to have their reasons for not moving too rapidly forward, and so the day passed in comparative inaction, the whole resembling, with its slow manoeuvring of troops and regular firing, the operations of a sham-fight or a field-day of volunteers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>We had the opportunity here of witnessing <num value="1">one</num> of those daring feats which <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00239.00832" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName> was so constantly performing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>He had been greatly annoyed during the day by a squadron of Federal cavalry which operated with great dash against his batteries, rapidly throwing forward their sharpshooters and as rapidly withdrawing them, after their muskets had been discharged, behind a piece of wood which completely hid them from view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>This they did before <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00239.00833" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName> could get a shot at them, and they had already killed or disabled many of his horses, when our gallant major, losing all patience, suddenly advanced with <num value="1">one</num> of his light howitzers at full gallop towards the wood, where the horses were unhitched and the piece drawn by hand through the impeding undergrowth which rendered further progress of the horses impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>From our position, which was some distance to the right of the batteries, we could plainly see the <rs>Yankee</rs> squadron, which had come very quietly to a halt without the slightest suspicion that a cannon loaded with a double charge of canister was directed upon them from a point only a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> off. All at once, the thunder of the howitzer was heard, and its iron hail swept through the ranks of the <rs>Yankees</rs>, killing <num value="8">eight</num> of their number, among whom was the colour-bearer, wounding several others, and putting the rest to flight in hopeless stampede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>Before the <rs>Yankees</rs> could recover from their astonishment, the howitzer was removed, the horses were hitched to it again, and it had arrived safely at the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>It would have been exceptional, indeed, if, confronting the enemy so closely, we had not been compelled to fight on this <quote>day of rest,</quote> for it is remarkable that many of the most important and sanguinary engagements of the war in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>-<placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName> and others &mdash; were fought on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>The enemy commenced his attack on us at an early hour with great vigour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>A double line of tirailleurs advanced in excellent order; <num value="4">four</num> batteries opened upon our guns from different points; the air shook with the continuous roar of the cannonade; on every side the bullets buzzed like infuriated insects; on the whole, the outward signs were rather those of a great battle than of a mere cavalry combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>This day the enemy's artillery was admirably well served, and its effect was very dreadful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>Just as I rode up to a battery, which was answering as rapidly as possible the <rs>Yankee</rs> fire, a hostile shell blew up <num value="1">one</num> of our caissons, killing and wounding <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> several of the men, and stunning me completely for several minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>For some time the fire was terrific at this spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>In less than half an hour <num value="1">one</num> battery alone lost <num value="15">fifteen</num> men killed and wounded, and I was obliged to force the frightened ambulance-drivers to the assistance of their suffering and dying comrades, by putting my revolver to their heads and threatening to shoot them if they did not go. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>On our right the sharpshooting grew warmer and warmer, the enemy bringing line after line of their dismounted men into action, and I was despatched thither by <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0012.00241.00836" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to watch the movements of the <rs>Yankees</rs>, and to animate our soldiers to an obstinate opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>Here I found my dashing friend <persName n="Rosser,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00241.00837" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosser</surname></persName> stationed with his brave fellows of the <orgName type="regiment" key="5VACav">5th Virginia Cavalry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>In reply to my question as to how he was getting along, he said, <quote>Come and see for yourself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>So, to obtain a good look at the enemy, we rode forward together through the wide gaps in the stone fences, which had been made to admit of the passage of cavalry and artillery, and presently discovered, somewhat late, that we had got much nearer to our antagonists than we had intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>Suddenly the <rs>Yankee</rs> sharpshooters emerged from behind rocks and trees, sending their bullets in most alarming proximity to our ears, and running forward to cut us off from our line of retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>Fortunately, we were both well mounted, and our horses had escaped a wound, so that we were able to clear the stone fences where they stood in our way, without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>This steeplechase afforded great amusement to <persName n="Rosser,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00241.00838" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, who seemed delighted at having got me into what he called <quote>a little trap,</quote> but what I regarded as an exceedingly ticklish situation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>As the far superior numbers of the enemy's cavalry, which up to this time we had successfully opposed, began now to be reinforced by infantry, <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0012.00241.00839" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> at last decided to fall back upon a new position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>The retreat through Union was admirably covered by <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00241.00840" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName> with his artillery, and was <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> executed with great steadiness and order under a perfect hail of shot and shell, which, crashing through the houses of the little village, had already set on fire several stables and straw-ricks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>The furious flames, leaping from <num value="1">one</num> to another of these great masses of combustible material, and the dense volumes of smoke that rolled from them, added to the terror and confusion of the scene, which now became truly frightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>On a ridge, behind a small creek where we had encamped the previous night, about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> beyond the town on the road leading to <placeName key="tgn,2114702" n="1.000 27" reg="upperville, fauquier, virginia">Upperville</placeName>, we halted and again confronted our assailants, who did not keep us long in waiting for their attack, and ere half an hour had elapsed the thunder of cannon again shook the air, and the sharpshooters on either side were hotly engaged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>The enemy here, by a resolute and united charge, drove a portion of our dismounted men back in some confusion through the woods; and the officer in command, the gallant young <persName n="Bullock,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0012.00242.00841" reg="mostcommon:Bullock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bullock</surname></persName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA5">5th Virginia</orgName>, in the attempt to rally them, had his horse shot under him, and, before he could get on his legs again, found himself surrounded by the <rs>Yankees</rs>, who demanded his surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/><persName n="Bullock,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00242.00842" reg="mostcommon:Bullock,nomatch:0"><surname>Bullock</surname></persName>, however, responded with <num value="2">two</num> shots of his revolver, killing <num value="2">two</num> of his adversaries, and then endeavoured to save himself by flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>The whole incident having taken place within <num value="50">fifty</num> paces of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00242.00843" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and myself, we could see, and even distinctly hear, the <rs>Yankees</rs> as they gave chase to our poor captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>Taking some of our couriers, and such of the tirailleurs as had recovered from their stampede, with us, we galloped forward at once to the assistance of our brave comrade, whom we succeeded in rescuing from his pursuers, but in a state of such utter exhaustion that we had to lift him to the back of <num value="1">one</num> of the led horses that chanced to be on the spot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>After a short but spirited resistance we were again compelled to retire, turning round and showing fight wherever <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> the nature of the ground would admit of it, until late in the afternoon we took a new position near the large estate of <persName n="Dulaney,Colonel,,,," id="n0008.0012.00243.00844" reg="mostcommon:Dulaney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Dulaney</surname></persName>, which was of some strategical importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>Preparing for a more serious opposition to the movements of the enemy, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00243.00845" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and myself had halted on an eminence which afforded an extensive view of the surrounding country, when a squadron of Federal cavalry, which came trotting along over an open field in beautiful lines as if on parade, and which seemed quite disdainful of the opposing host, attracted our attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00243.00846" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> turned to me, and said, <quote><rs type="role2">Major</rs>, pray amuse yourself with giving these gentlemen a lesson: take <num value="2">two</num> of <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00243.00847" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName>'s guns, place them in such position as you think best, and receive our impudent friends with a proper salute.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>Our cannoneers followed me with loud expressions of joy, bringing with them the <num value="2">two</num> howitzers, to a small hill, where dense bushes concealed our preparations from the enemy's notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>The guns were carefully aimed, and when the hostile squadron came within easy range, both shots sounded simultaneously, the shells exploding with wonderful accuracy right in front of the foe, emptying several saddles, and driving our contemptuous adversaries into headlong fight, along the line of which we sent several missiles from the howitzers with less effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>All our pieces were now concentrated on a wooded acclivity, and were soon brought into a spirited cannonade with <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> hostile batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>As usual, <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0012.00243.00848" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and his Staff exposed themselves for several hours continuously to the hottest fire-shells and solid shot fell around us on all sides, covering us with dust and dirt, and tearing the splinters from the trees right and left; and I could not comprehend how any of us escaped death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>The scene was <num value="1">one</num> of the wildest and grandest confusion and destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>Men were falling, killed or wounded, on every hand, wounded horses galloped hither and thither, and the numerous herds of <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> cattle, which had until that <name>Sunday</name> grazed peacefully in their wide pastures, wrought up to the highest pitch of brute frenzy by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle they had ever known, ran about in frantic terror and excitement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>In the very fury of the cannonade, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> little incidents excited our surprise and amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>A shell, falling in the midst of a large flock of sheep, exploded there, and we thought that the greater part had been converted into mutton; but when the dust and smoke had cleared away, we saw the frightened animals scamper off, not <num value="1">one</num> of their number missing, and all apparently unhurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>A few minutes afterwards, a stout young bullock, out of a herd of oxen that had been galloping up and down for a considerable time before our batteries, suddenly threw a sommersault, and lay, to all seeming, dead upon the field, but presently got on his legs again, and after reeling and tumbling about for a little while in a drunken sort of way, started off all at once with the speed of an arrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>I have already mentioned cases of prostration by <quote>windage</quote> of cannon-balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>A more diverting instance occurred, in a later fight, with <num value="1">one</num> of our soldiers, a North Carolinian, who, lying flat on his back, apparently badly wounded, answered to <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0012.00244.00849" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s inquiry whether he was hurt, <quote>Oh, General, I shall soon be all right again, but I am dreadfully demoralised by a bomb-shell;</quote> the fact being, that a cannon-ball, passing very close to his head, had knocked him over. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>With the darkness of evening, our situation became critical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>Our artillery had lost many men and horses; our cavalry, having been exposed all day to a murderous fire, had also suffered severely, and our sharpshooters were unable any longer to resist the double and triple lines of Federal tirailleurs, which were again and again sent against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/><persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0012.00244.00850" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> accordingly determined to retreat to <placeName key="tgn,2114702" n="1.000 27" reg="upperville, fauquier, virginia">Upperville</placeName>, and ordered me to recall our dismounted men all along <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>To obey this order, I had to ride to our extreme right, where <persName n="Farley,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0012.00245.00851" reg="mostcommon:Farley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Farley</surname></persName>, with a small body of riflemen, occupied some hay-stacks, which he had held all day against the vastly superior numbers of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>As I was the only man on horseback in range of the <rs>Yankee</rs> carbines, I was exposed for the whole distance to a heavy fusillade; but returning was yet more perilous, for having to ride between the enemy and our own troops, the former hotly pursuing, and the latter, in their dogged retreat, returning with spirit every shot that was sent after them, I was subjected to <num value="2">two</num> fires, and was in as much danger of being killed by friendly as by hostile bullets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> did not continue their pursuit after nightfall, and allowed us to retire quietly to the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,2114702" n="1.000 27" reg="upperville, fauquier, virginia">Upperville</placeName>, about a mile from which place we bivouacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>A feeling of devout and fervent thankfulness possessed my heart, as I lay down on my blanket for a short night's rest, and recalled the innumerable dangers through which I had safely passed on that exciting eventful day. These smaller combats with the enemy are far more dangerous than great battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>Especially is this true as regards the staff-officer, who, having to be constantly in the saddle, remains throughout the day exposed to the enemy's particular attentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>In a general engagement there is much more rattle of musketry and thunder of cannon, but the fire is not so much concentrated upon a small tract of ground, and <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the balls and bullets which wound or kill, find their mark accidentally. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>Fighting was renewed the following morning, and the tremendous hosts of the <rs>Yankees</rs> advancing upon us across the fields, which I could compare only to a mighty avalanche, seemed likely to crush everything before them; but the gallant <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> fellows of <persName n="Lee,,Fitz,,," id="n0008.0012.00246.00852" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName> stood the shock of their attack nobly, and succeeded for a time in checking the onward movement of their columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>This I soon found near <placeName reg="Ashby's Gap">Ashby's Gap</placeName>, a few miles from <placeName key="tgn,2114702" n="1.000 27" reg="upperville, fauquier, virginia">Upperville</placeName>, where a range of mountains, spurs of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, accessible for a long distance only by a single road, made successful opposition to a far superior force possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>On my return to the <rs>General</rs>, the conflict had reached its height, and, in my opinion, the urgent necessity of immediate retreat was patent to all. Nevertheless, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0012.00246.00854" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was for continuing the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>Again and again animating his men by his presence and the exposure of his own person, he led our admirable soldiers to the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>Not until <num value="1">one</num> of our caissons had been exploded by a well-aimed shot; not until <persName n="Wickham,Colonel,,,," id="n0008.0012.00246.00855" reg="mostcommon:Wickham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, temporarily commanding <persName n="Lee,,Fitz,,," id="n0008.0012.00246.00856" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName>, had been wounded at my side, a fragment of shell striking him in the neck; not until the hostile infantry was outflanking us on either side,was the order given for the withdrawal, which, in consequence of the long delay of our commander in issuing the order, was managed, I am sorry to say, with a great deal of haste and confusion, and came very near being a rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>Here all the members of the <rs>Staff</rs> soon gathered around me, and many more questions were asked of me in a few minutes than I could answer in an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>The greater part of these questions referred to the pretty and accomplished young ladies I had seen in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the very mention of whose names caused the hearts of several of my younger comrades to beat quicker than the excitement of the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>Opossum-hunting is a favourite sport with the negroes, and they rarely fail to make sure of their game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>The meat of this ugly animal, which grows very fat in the latter part of the autumn, is quite similar to pork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>The hunters go out always at night, when the opossum comes forth from his hole in quest of food; and the dogs, which have been carefully trained for the purpose, follow up the scent until they have made out in which tree the frightened fugitive has taken refuge, and commence at once a most dismal howling at the foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>The tree is then cut down, and the opossum, which invariably simulates death, falls an easy prey into the clutches of his enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>(This ruse of the animal in appearing to be dead gives rise to the well-known American phrase of <quote>playing &lsquo;possum,</quote> when any <num value="1">one</num> affects unconsciousness.) The stranger, unaccustomed to the manner <pb id="p.281" n="281"/> of hunting the opossum, might suppose, from the horrible din that assails his ears &mdash; the blowing of horns, the yell of human voices, and the furious barking of the dogs &mdash; that the wild jager of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, or some equally ferocious beast of the <rs>European</rs> forest, had come over on a visit to the backwoods of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>Very frequently in the opossum-hunt the dogs start a racoon, which more closely resembles the fox, and makes always a gallant fight, at times punishing his assailants severely. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>The return to camp was even more distressing than our ride of the morning, as a heavy snow-storm set in, which continued throughout the night; and we reached our headquarters, men and horses wet and chilled, and almost wearied out by a journey of more than <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>The following morning we were enlivened by snowball fights, which commenced as skirmishes near our headquarters, but extended over the neighbouring camps, and assumed the aspect of general engagements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>The struggle had now the appearance of a regular battle, with its charges and counterchargers &mdash; the wild enthusiasm of the men and the noble emulation of the officers finding expression in loud commands and yet louder cheering, while the air was darkened with the snowballs as the current of the fight moved to and fro over the well-contested field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>Very soon the exact site of the unhappy town was indicated, even through the fog, by a rising column of smoke and dust, and the flames of burning buildings broke out of the dark overhanging canopy with reddening glare, while the bursting bombs flashed athwart the gloom like the arrowy lightning in a thunder-cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>Our batteries did not respond to the guns of the enemy with a single shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>It was evident enough that nothing could be done to save the place from the desolation to which it had been fore-doomed by the wanton barbarity of the <rs>Federal</rs> commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>The horrible din lasted for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, and was succeeded by perfect silence &mdash; the silence of a solitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>About <pb id="p.297" n="297"/> noon, a gentle breeze, springing up just as the roar of the latest guns died away, lifted the veil which had mysteriously shrouded the valley, and the sun, breaking through the clouds, seemed to mock with its garish splendour the smoking ruins it revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>Sad indeed was the scene that presented itself to our gaze, and to the eyes, filled with tears, of the mournful fugitives whose once happy homes lay before them, shattered or smouldering; and every heart of the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of brave Confederate soldiers who witnessed it burned for revenge. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>It may be supposed that we thought with great anxiety of our <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> brigade, which had all the time been exposed to this <hi rend="italics">feu d'enfer</hi>; but the sharp crack of their rifles soon gave us the gratifying assurance that these gallant fellows, unmindful of the death and anguish which shot and shell had been spreading amid their ranks, had firmly maintained their ground, and were ready to meet the enemy's attack; and a little later we received the satisfactory report that a renewed attempt of the <rs>Federals</rs> to force the building of their bridges had been defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>In the quietude that followed the hurly-burly of the day we exchanged felicitations upon the great blunder of the <rs>Federal</rs> commander in thus running right into the lion's mouth, and <pb id="p.298" n="298"/> preparing to attack us in a position of our own choice, where his defeat was wellnigh certain &mdash; a lack of generalship on his part which we had scarcely dared to hope for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>The enemy seemed as busy as bees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>Long trains of artillery and ammunition and provision waggons were to be seen descending the heights on the opposite side, and interminable columns of infantry, blue in colour, and blurred by distance, flowed towards us like the waves of a steadily-advancing sea. On and on they came, with flash of bayonets and flutter of flags, to the measure of military music, each note of which was borne to us by the morning breeze, and we could distinctly observe them deploy into line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>From the many heavy batteries over the river rose, from time to time, little white puffs of smoke, and the deep, dull boom of the big guns was almost immediately followed <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> by the angry whirr of a <num value="50">50</num> or <num value="100">100</num>-pound shell, which falling, in the majority of instances, too short, did little or no damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>Our artillery, from different points along our line, occasionally answered the enemy's guns with just as little effect; and our confident belief that the great battle would be fought on the morning of the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> was more and more weakened as the day wore on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>About <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> I was asked by <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0016.00299.01081" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to accompany him on a ride along our line of battle to the extreme right, that we might look after our horsemen, reconnoitre the position and movements of the enemy in that direction, and ascertain whether the nature of the ground was such that a charge of our whole <orgName n="Cavalry Division" type="division">cavalry division</orgName> during the impending fight might be profitably attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>It was a pleasure and an encouragement to pass the extended lines of our soldiers, who were lying carelessly behind their earthworks, or actively engaged in throwing up new ones-some cooking, others gaily discussing the designs of the enemy, and greeting with loud cheers of derision the enormous shells, which they called <quote><name>Yankee</name> flour-barrels,</quote> as these came tumbling into the woods around them, and to read in every bronzed face of them all eagerness for the conflict, and confidence as to the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>The atmosphere had now again become obscure, and the fog was rolling up from the low swampy grounds along the margin of <placeName reg="Quarter Creek, Greene, Virginia" key="tgn,2603125">Deep Run Creek</placeName>, in the immediate front of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0008.0016.00299.01082" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0008.0016.00299.01083" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>Here we turned off into a narrow bridle-path, which bore away some distance from our lines, but would shorten our ride by nearly a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>We had proceeded but a few steps in a careless trot, when suddenly a long line of horsemen in skirmishing order appeared directly before us in the mist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>I felt very certain they were Federal horsemen, but <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0016.00299.01084" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was unwilling to believe that the <rs>Yankees</rs> would have the audacity to approach our position so closely; and as the greater part of them wore a <pb id="p.300" n="300"/> brownish dust-coloured jacket over their uniforms, he set them down as a small command of our own cavalry returning from a reconnaissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>So we continued upon our route yet a little farther, until, at a distance of about <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure>, several carbine-shots, whose bullets whistled around our heads, taught us very plainly with whom we had to deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>At the same moment <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> of the dragoons spurred furiously towards us, demanding, with loud outcries, our surrender; hearing which, we galloped in some haste back to our lines, where our bold pursuers were received and put to flight by <orgName n="sharpshooters"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0008.0016.00300.01085" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s sharpshooters</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>A considerable number of our infantry skirmishers now moved forward to drive the dashing cavalrymen off; but the latter held their ground gallantly, and kept up so annoying a fire with their long-range carbines, that our men did not obtain any advantage over them, while <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0016.00300.01086" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and myself could not look without admiration upon the address and intrepidity our enemies displayed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>This opened the way for us, and we continued our ride without farther interruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2460"/>He did not regard this as necessary, as he did not believe that, under the sweeping cross-fire of our artillery, the <rs>Federals</rs> could ever advance so far. The events of the following day proved, however, that I had been right, as, under cover of this identical piece of wood, a hostile division approached so rapidly and unexpectedly that here alone our line was broken, and we suffered severe loss before the enemy could be driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>We found our horsemen in good spirits, and occupying their position on the <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName> road, where the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> was engaged in a lively skirmish with a body of Federal cavalry, which ended in the withdrawal of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>Our comrades of the other arms of the service had indulged in some captious criticism of the cavalry for not having given the decisive finishing stroke to great battles by grand and overwhelming charges, as had been done in the times of <placeName reg="Frederick, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002161">Frederick</placeName> the <rs>Great</rs> and Napoleon-criticism that was unwarranted and unjust, since the nature of the ground in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> did not favour the operations of cavalry, and since the great improvement in firearms in our day had necessitated a very material change in cavalry tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>Still more unkind and uncalled &mdash; for did such animadversions appear when it was considered what important services had been rendered by the cavalry &mdash; the hard fighting they had done, the wearisome marches they had made, the fatigue and cold and hunger they had cheerfully endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>Nevertheless <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0016.00301.01091" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was anxious, with every officer and private under his command, to show that we were able to do what other cavalry had accomplished before us; and all burned with the noble ambition of winning an enduring fame on so grand a theatre, with the eyes of the whole army resting upon us. The <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> <measure n="40centuries" type="date">forty centuries</measure> that looked down from the <name>Pyramids</name> on the legions of the mighty <rs>Corsican</rs> did not inspire them with a more generous ardour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>The open plain before us, cut by only a few ditches and with only here and there a fence running across it, seemed to offer us the arena for the realisation of our dreams of glory; but upon a closer survey of the ground we found it much too soft for a charge with any chance of success, as the horses, moving even at a moderate speed, would sink several feet into the mire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2466"/>A sluggish artillery fire which had lasted all day, grew, about <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>, into a spirited cannonade all along the lines, in which the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light batteries</orgName> on our side of the river took no part, it being altogether maintained by their heavier guns on the <rs type="place">Stafford Hills</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>This continued until <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, when the firing slackened again to the occasional boom of the largest pieces of ordnance. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>Thus we proceeded until we reached a slight eminence only a few <placeName><distance reg="100yards">hundred yards</distance> from the <rs>Yankees</rs></placeName>, where <num value="2">two</num> big posts, the remains of a dismantled gate, concealed us from their observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>Our own view was so satisfactory, that with our field-glasses we could distinctly mark the features of the men. It was evident enough to us that they were engaged in converting the simple road into a most formidable work of defence, and that in <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s front they were massing large forces of infantry and artillery, of the latter of which I counted <num value="32">thirty-two</num> guns in <num value="1">one</num> battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>Upon hearing what I had to tell them, both generals determined at once to repair themselves to the point of look-out from which we had just withdrawn, and, leaving their numerous escort behind, accompanied only by an orderly, they rode forward under my guidance to the barn already mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/>Here the horses were placed in charge of the orderly, and we made our way on foot to the gate-posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>Fearing to augment the danger of their situation by my presence, I retired to the roadside some <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards distant</measure>, and left the <num value="2">two</num> great leaders to their conference and survey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>I must confess I felt extremely nervous as regards their safety, so close to the enemy, who surely little suspected that the <num value="2">two</num> greatest heroes of the war were so nearly in their clutches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/><num value="1">One</num> well-directed shot, or a rapid dash of resolute horsemen, might have destroyed the hopes and confidence of our whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>To the right we looked down upon the river for a considerable distance, and could plainly see and count the heavy guns on the opposite bank, and could even hear the conversation of the cannoneers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>Cautious as we had been, however, the <rs>Yankees</rs> quickly discovered our presence, and a number of their sharpshooters, sent forward to dislodge us, commenced <pb id="p.315" n="315"/> a sharp fire of exploding bullets, which, striking the objects around us, burst, with the noise peculiar to these projectiles, and scattered their fragments in every direction like smallshot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>Well protected by the pine-trees we paid little attention to this fusillade, when suddenly I observed <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery moving into position, and before <persName n="Blackford,,,,," id="n0008.0017.00315.01143" reg="mostcommon:Blackford,W.,W.,,:1"><surname>Blackford</surname></persName> finished uttering the words, <quote>Von, the <rs>Yankees</rs> are going to shell us out of this,</quote> a missile, whizzing towards us, struck the topmost branches of <num value="1">one</num> of the pines, and, exploding there, rained down upon us a shower of limbs and splinters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>Other followed in rapid succession with increasing accuracy of aim, so that we concluded to evacuate the spot and seek shelter for a time on the opposite side of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>Breaking at once through the bushes, we thought it would be an easy matter enough to get to a place of security, but the enemy's gunners followed our movements with a nicety of calculation so admirable that shot after shot came yet nearer and nearer to us, and at the very moment that we supposed we had got out of their reach, a shell passed so near to our heads that my gallant friend and myself were precipitated headlong by the force of windage at least <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> down the hillside, where we both lay motionless for a brief space, and then rose in a fit of uncontrollable laughter as we looked each in the other's blank and astonished face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>Returning, as soon as the firing had ceased, to the spot we had so suddenly abandoned, we saw the <rs>Federal</rs> lines moving forward to their new attack, which was introduced and supported by a cannonade of several <num value="100">hundred</num> pieces equal in fury to that of the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>The balls fired from the opposite side of the river howled and hissed in their course over our heads, each shot of the heavy guns reverberating from the cliffs like rolling thunder, while the musketry soon became audible again, giving proof by its increasing vehemence that the hostile parties were now hotly <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>An hour of anxiety and doubt passed away, until at <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> we saw scattered fugitives straggling to the rear, their numbers augmenting every moment, until whole regiments, brigades, and divisions, in utter confusion and bewildered flight, covered the plain before us. <persName n="Blackford,,,,," id="n0008.0017.00316.01144" reg="mostcommon:Blackford,W.,W.,,:1"><surname>Blackford</surname></persName>, as excited as myself, jumped from his hiding-place, and, throwing his hat in the air, cried out, <quote>Thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, they are whippedthey are running!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>Yes; there was no doubt about it-they were running; and all the efforts of their officers, whom we could distinctly see using their sabres against their own men to check the precipitate retreat, were unavailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>All discipline was lost for the moment, and those <num value="1000">thousands</num> of troops whom an hour before we had seen advancing in beautiful military order, now presented the spectacle of a stampeded and demoralised mob.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>A single cannon-shot fired from our centre was to be the signal for the general attack by our whole line, at which movement <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0017.00316.01148" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was to press forward with his cavalry and <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse-artillery</orgName> vigorously upon the enemy's flank. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>Returning to our position on the <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName> road, we awaited in anxious silence the so much desired signal; but minute after minute passed by, and the dark veil of night began to envelop the valley, when <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0017.00316.01149" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, believing that the <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> summons agreed upon had been given, issued the order to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>Our situation had become, indeed, a critical <num value="1">one</num>, when a courier from <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0008.0017.00317.01152" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:5"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> galloped up at full speed bringing the order for <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0017.00317.01153" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to retreat as quickly as he could to his original position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>Things looked very little changed when, on the cold, clear morning of the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="15">15th</day></dateStruct>, we rode up to <placeName reg="Jackson Hill, Davidson, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075237">Jackson's Hill</placeName>; and <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0018.00324.01175" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> deciding to remain until serious fighting should commence, we had an opportunity of having a good look at the devastations caused by the tremendous artilleryfire of the 3th.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>The forest was literally torn to pieces-trees more than a foot in diameter were snapped in <num value="2">two</num>, large branches were shattered to splinters, and scarcely a small twig but showed marks of some kind of missile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>In many places the ground was ploughed up by the cannon-balls, which together with pieces of shell, canister, and grape-shot, lay strewn in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>The morning passed slowly away, the anxious silence maintained being broken only but the firing from time to time of the heavy batteries; and many of our leaders, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0018.00324.01177" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0008.0018.00324.01178" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:5"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> foremost, began to give up any hope of a renewal of the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>The latter general was still in favour of a night attack, and proposed that our men should be stripped naked to the waist, so that they might easily recognise each other in <pb id="p.325" n="325"/> the darkness and confusion of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>To this <persName><foreName>Stonewall</foreName></persName> did not think proper to accede, as the application was not signed by the <rs>Federal</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>, an omission which, on several previous occasions, had opened the way to serious misunderstandings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>All had been going on thus smoothly for half an hour, when suddenly some of the batteries in the enemy's centre opened a heavy fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>The excitement and consternation caused by this was immense; the cry of treason ran along our lines; our men hurried back to their arms, while the <rs>Federal</rs> officers exerted themselves to maintain unbroken the peaceful relations which threatened for some little time to end in a sanguinary conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>Fortunately, <pb id="p.326" n="326"/> however, the firing soon afterwards ceased, and full explanations being given, proving the apparently treacherous act to have been a mistake, the work of humanity proceeded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>Beside him lay his adjutant, a very fine-looking young man, who, riding a grey horse during the action, had attracted the attention of our men, and frequently elicited their admiration by his conspicuous gallantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>His noble charger, only a few steps from him, was pierced by several bullets, and had probably fallen at the same moment with his brave rider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>The poor wounded were in a miserable state after their long exposure to cold and hunger, and many were dying simply from starvation and neglect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>We held long and interesting conversations with the <rs>Yankee</rs> officers, and were not a little surprised at the freedom and severity of the criticisms they passed on their commander-in-chief, and the candid acknowledgment of the heavy losses and severe defeat they had sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/>These gentlemen asserted that <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n0008.0018.00326.01182" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> was perfectly incapable of commanding a large army; that his splendid troops had been sacrificed and slaughtered uselessly, but that the <rs>General</rs> himself had taken good care not to endanger his own life, having observed and directed the battle from <placeName reg="Phillip's House">Phillip's House</placeName>, a point of safety on the <name>Stafford</name> side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>There being but a comparatively small number of our dead, they were soon buried; but the <rs>Federal</rs> were occupied all day with their mournful task, and had not half finished when darkness put an end to their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>On our arrival at the battle-field we found our men scattered over the plain, busy burying the dead, large numbers of which were still lying about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>Reaching a place where about <num value="300">300</num> corpses had been collected to be lodged in <num value="1">one</num> common grave, some of our men showed a number of small torpedoes, which they informed us had been set in large numbers by the enemy all over the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>Fortunately the charge of powder with which these infernal machines were prepared had been so damped by the heavy rain that they did not explode, and by this failure a large number of our men were saved from destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>Soon afterwards we were much amused by lighting upon the entire band of a Yankee infantry regiment, who, having encamped at some distance from their troops, had been quite forsaken, and were still fast asleep when they were taken prisoners to the last man by our Mississippians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>They seemed but little troubled at their fate, and cheerfully struck up the tunes of <placeName reg="Fort Dixie">Dixie</placeName>, to the great delight of our men, who meanwhile set about preparing for them whatever comforts <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> our rough hospitality could afford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>After about an hour's ride we reached <placeName key="tgn,2487262" n="1.000 1" reg="lees hill, fredericksburg, virginia">Lee's Hill</placeName>, where we found <persName n="Phillips,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0018.00328.01185" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> again, whom I invited to join me in a little tour to <placeName reg="Maryes Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2495439">Marye's Heights</placeName> and the field in front of them, the horrors of which had been depicted in the most vivid colours by all who had visited the dreadful spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>As the <rs>Federal</rs> batteries on the opposite side of the river were firing on every horseman who showed himself, I took <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0008.0018.00328.01186" reg="mostcommon:Pelham,John,,,:3"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName>'s mulatto servant, <persName n="Newton,,,,," id="n0008.0018.00328.01187" reg="mostcommon:Newton,nomatch:0"><surname>Newton</surname></persName>, who happened to be there, along with us, and, leaving our horses out of sight in his charge, we descended on foot to the plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>The nature of the ground towards the town is open and flat, broken only by some plank fences, and dotted with a few wooden houses scattered here and there, All these objects, and even the very ground, were so thickly riddled with bullets that scarcely a square inch was without its dint; and it became incomprehensible to me how even that small few of the most dashing assailants, who had run up within <num value="15">fifteen</num> paces of our lines, could have survived this terrific fire long enough to do so. Many of the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers had found death seeking shelter in the small courtyards of the houses <pb id="p.329" n="329"/> behind the wooden plank fences surrounding them, but which, of course, offered not the slightest protection; and heaps of the corpses of these poor fellows filled the narrow enclosures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>On a space of ground not over <measure n="2acres" type="area">two acres</measure> we counted <measure n="680" type="dead">680 dead</measure> bodies; and more than <dateStruct value="1200--"><year reg="1200">1200</year></dateStruct> altogether were found on the small plain between the heights and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, those nearest the town having mostly been killed by our artillery, which had played with dreadful effect upon the enemy's dense columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>And so he was. Hearing our steps the unfortunate sufferer opened his glassy eyes and looked at us with so pitiable an expression that I could not for long after recall it without shuddering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>A surgeon being close at hand, was at once called to the spot to render what assistance was yet possible; but he pronounced the man in a dying condition, and observed that it was totally opposed to all medical experience, and could only be considered in the light of a miracle, that a human being with such a wound should have lived through nearly <measure n="60hours" type="date">sixty hours</measure> of exposure and starvation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>In the mean time our little company had attracted the notice of the enemy on the other side of the river, and several shells had already bowled over our heads, when soon the firing grew so heavy, and the missiles struck and exploded in <pb id="p.330" n="330"/> such increasing proximity to us, that we decided on getting out of range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>So, shaking hands with <persName n="Ransom,General,,,," id="n0008.0018.00330.01192" reg="mostcommon:Ransom,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ransom</surname></persName> and thanking him much for his kindness, we returned to the place where we had left our horses; but mulatto and chargers had disappeared together; and after a lengthened search, we had nearly made up our minds that we must return on foot, when the fugitives were found at a considerable distance and hidden in a clump of bushes, the worthy <rs>Newton</rs> still trembling, and completely <quote>demoralised</quote> with the fright inspired by some of the shells which, fired too high, had exploded in his neighbourhood and induced his rapid retreat. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>The tranquillity in which the day passed off was interrupted only by the firing from the enemy's batteries, which, by the way, very nearly proved fatal to our friend <persName n="Vizetelly,,,,," id="n0008.0018.00330.01193" reg="mostcommon:Vizetelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Vizetelly</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>Horror-stricken at this sad incident, and having no call of duty to remain, the artist at once put spurs into his charger's flanks, and galloped off as <pb id="p.331" n="331"/> fast as the noble steed could carry him. But the hostile gunners seemed to take particular pleasure in aiming at the flying horseman, and ever closer and closer flew the unpleasant missiles about his ears, while we who from <placeName key="tgn,2487262" n="1.000 1" reg="lees hill, fredericksburg, virginia">Lee's Hill</placeName> were spectators of the unenviable position in which our guest was placed, were for some time seriously alarmed that we should never again hear his merry laugh and joyous songs; but at last he reached us in safety, though much exhausted, and was received with loud cheering in our midst. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>The following day <persName n="Wynne,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0019.00334.01205" reg="mostcommon:Wynne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wynne</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lawley,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00334.01206" reg="mostcommon:Lawley,Francis,,,:1"><surname>Lawley</surname></persName> started, accompanied by several members of our military family, for a ride over the battle-field, I myself undertaking an expedition after the anxiously coveted case of champagne; for although I entertained but slight hope of its having escaped the attention of the soldiers, I considered that there was a bare possibility of recovery, sufficient to make it worth while to risk the trouble in so valuable a cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>Alas! my worst fears were destined to be realised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>Not a vestige of the case or of the faithless sergeant to whose keeping it had been trusted could I light on, and I had to return all chapfallen from my vain errand, and announce to my comrades that they must make the best of water and good spirits as a substitute for the effervescent stimulant; and, indeed, so cheerily were we all disposed, that our indignation soon evaporated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>Much to our sorrow, on the following day all our guests deserted us, and we were left to the unrelieved routine of camp life in all its dull and listless monotony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>The bad weather, moreover, setting in with full force, the campaign might be regarded as completely at an end for the next <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>; and as the hostile army was reported to have gone into winter quarters, our own soon followed the example. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>The stroke of many axes rang through the surrounding forests and oak copses, and pine thickets dissolved from the view to give place to complete little towns of huts and loghouses, provided with comfortable fireplaces, from whose gigantic chimneys curled upwards gracefully and cheerily into the crisp winter air many a column of pale-blue smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>The weather became now every day worse, snow-storms alternating with rains and severe frosts; and if officers and men were tolerably well off under the circumstances, it was not so with our poor beasts, whose condition, from want of food, exposure, and vermin, was pitiable indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>The sheds and stables, improvised for them out of logs and pine-branches, offered but scant protection against the battering of wind, rain, and snow, which assailed them on all sides, penetrating through the lightly-thatched roofs, and the wretched quadrupeds stood for the most part knee-deep in water or slush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>Ere long a disease bred out of this unhappy state of things showed itself, and spread rapidly throughout the camp, our cavalry and artillery losing more than onefourth of their horses and mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>The symptoms of the malady became <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visible just above the hoof, whence it gradually extended, eventually involving the entire limb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>We received for forage a certain amount of <name>Indian</name> corn, which was supplied quite regularly; but hay and straw grew every day more scarce, and at last failed us altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>I had in more opulent times prepared for myself a most luxurious couch of hay, on which I slept softly, as on a bed of eider-down; but the lamentations of my negro over the scarcity of <quote>long forage,</quote> and, still more, the woeful aspect of my animals, soon prevailed on me to abandon this luxury, and lay the sacrifice in their troughs, to be hungrily devoured by my poor beasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>The mules withstood the effects of scarce fodder, cold, and wet, better than did the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>Especially was this exhibited in the case of my grey mule Kitt, for in spite of hard times she looked as gay and sleek as ever; but it must be added that she displayed an omnivorous appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>All was fodder to her <pb id="p.336" n="336"/> impartial palate, from pine-leaves to scraps of leather, and even the blankets with which I covered my horses were not safe from her voracity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>On the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="2">21st</day></dateStruct> we had a visit from <persName n="Lee,,Custis,,," id="n0008.0019.00336.01209" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, son of our <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, and aide-de-camp to <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0008.0019.00336.01210" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, who wished to inspect the battle-field and the town of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>; and at his request <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0019.00336.01211" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and I gladly accompanied him on the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>I had thus the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> direct opportunity presented to me of leisurely inspecting the ruins of poor <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, which, with its shattered houses, streets ript open, and demolished churches, impressed me sadly enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>The inhabitants had nearly all deserted the place, the only visible exceptions being here and there a wretched pauper or aged negro, to whom no refuge elsewhere was open, creeping noiselessly along the silent street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>The brave soldiers of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Barksdale,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00336.01212" reg="mostcommon:Barksdale,nomatch:0"><surname>Barksdale</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, however, who had so nobly resisted the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempt of the enemy to cross the river, were re-established in the town, and comfortably installed in several of the large buildings now abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>The firing of the pickets having once more ceased, a network of friendly relations had begun again to connect them, and an interchange of communications also of the necessaries of life recommenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>To carry on these the most ingenious devices were resorted to, at some of which I was vastly amused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>On reaching the river we beheld quite a little fleet of small boats, from <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> in length, under full sail, with flying pennants, crossing backwards and forwards between the shores of the river, conveying tobacco and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> newspapers over to the <name>Stafford</name> side, and returning loaded in exchange with sugar and coffee and Northern journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>The diminutive craft were handled with considerable nautical skill, and rudder and sails set so deftly to wind and stream, that they always unerringly landed at the exact point of destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>Some days afterwards, this free-trade movement <pb id="p.337" n="337"/> having outpassed the limits which were judged safe or convenient, a sudden embargo, in the shape of a severe and stringent order, was put upon the friendly traffic of foe with foe, to the mutual and unmitigated disgust of both sides. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>Next day, under favour of a flag of truce sent by the <rs>Federals</rs> to negotiate an exchange of prisoners, I received a message from <rs type="role2">Baron</rs> H., an ex-officer of the <name>Prussian</name> army then serving on <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00337.01213" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s Staff, appointing a rendezvous at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>Although I set off at once, I found on reaching the town that H., impatient of waiting, or giving me up, had returned to the other side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>Vexed to have had my ride for nothing, I was, in no very good humour, turning my horse's head towards home, when I fell in with <persName n="Fairfax,Major,,,," id="n0008.0019.00337.01214" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Fairfax</surname></persName> of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00337.01215" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s Staff and the officers bearing the flag of truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>After expressing their sympathy with my disappointment, they invited me over to the other side, the truce not having yet expired I replied that I should not be justified in complying with their invitation, as I had not, like <persName n="Fairfax,Major,,,," id="n0008.0019.00337.01216" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>, any business to transact, and should be running the risk of remaining longer on the <name>Stafford</name> side than I desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>My cautious scruples elicited a hearty laugh, and, pledging their personal honour for my safe return whenever I chose, they again pressed their rather extraordinary invitation in a manner that would have made it very uncourteous to decline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>On reaching the opposite shore, <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00337.01217" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName> and I were soon surrounded by a circle of Federal officers proffering every mark of politeness and hospitality, the latter being manifested by the production of several bottles of wine and whisky, which were soon in brisk circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>Meantime a number of orderlies had been despatched in search of H.; but after an hour of fruitless waiting I returned with <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00337.01218" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> emptying, as we took leave of our temporary hosts, a last cup of the speedy restoration of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>On arriving at headquarters I was greeted with a good scolding from <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00337.01219" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> for my <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> escapade; an old fox, he said, should never under any circumstances trust his head in the lion's mouth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>On the <dateStruct value="--23"><day reg="2">23d</day></dateStruct> we had the pleasure of welcoming once more among us <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0008.0019.00338.01220" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, the distant position of whose brigade on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> had rendered him a rare visitor of late; but as his absence had been well occupied, his enterprise and activity having inflicted considerable damage on the enemy, it was the less to be regretted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>Among his achievements was a raid across the river towards the end of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, with a small detachment of his brigade, when he surrounded and took prisoners to a man <num value="2">two</num> squadrons of a Pennsylvanian cavalry regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>Twice again, in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, he made similar expeditions to the rear of the <rs>Federals</rs> with equal success, capturing on the last occasion a large waggontrain laden with forage, provisions, and sutlers' stores, out of the latter of which he now brought us a quantity of luxuries as a Christmas present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>As <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0008.0019.00338.01221" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> had not yet visited the battle-field, I had much pleasure in tendering my services as his guide and companion on the occasion, and we did not return from the long rambling ride we took over the ground till late in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>On the following day arrived <persName n="Stuart,Mrs.,,,," id="n0008.0019.00338.01222" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, taking up her residence at a plantation not more than half a mile from headquarters, in the hope of spending Christmas-day with her husband, but unfortunately without taking into her reckoning the extreme uncertainty of the <rs>General</rs>'s movements, always, moreover, kept secret by him till the very last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>Christmas-eve had been spent in calm unsuspicious enjoyment, amidst long gossips over old times and consultations on the preparations of the next day's festive fare; and we were slumbering peacefully in the early morning, when we were suddenly roused by the sound of the bugle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/>To my intense astonishment I learned from <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0019.00338.01223" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> that in an hour he would start on a wide-ranging raid <pb id="p.339" n="339"/> in the rear of the <rs>Federal</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>With bitter chagrin I found my poor horses reduced, by cold and hunger, to so miserable a condition that not <num value="1">one</num> was fit for duty; <num value="2">two</num> of them, indeed, perished within the next few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>All my efforts to procure a new charger failed, so scarce had horses become, and I had the mortification of seeing the <rs>General</rs> and those few of my comrades who happened to be in better plight than myself ride off without me to join the regiments, which had already, from an early hour, received marching orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>As usual, however, I did not allow my discomfiture to affect me long, and my vexed spirit soon yielded to the consolation of an excellent <quote>egg-nogg</quote> <note anchored="yes" id="n.339.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>Encamped with his battery close to headquarters, in a dense pine thicket, he had, with the help of his cannoneers, built himself the snuggest little log-hut imaginable; and I was entirely restored to equanimity, after dinner, when I heard from my host that <rs type="role2">Major</rs> M., <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00339.01225" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s quartermaster, had <num value="2">two</num> horses for sale, <num value="1">one</num> of which would exactly suit my purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>Not to let slip so good an opportunity of a remount, I started, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing in the morning, for <rs type="role2">Major</rs> M.&lsquo;s camp, where I found that, though I had been quite correctly informed, my purchase would be saddled with onerous and unexpected conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>The horses were not to be sold separate; but, more than this, a lumbering family carriage was to go with them into the bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>The conditions were absolute, both coach and horses having belonged to a friend <pb id="p.340" n="340"/> of the quartermaster, who, holding a plantation within the lines of the enemy, had, in wholesome fear of <name>Yankee</name> depredators, sent him the entire equipage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>It was certainly an odd thing for a cavalry officer in the field to become owner of a stately family coach; nevertheless, I had no alternative, and so, having paid the comparatively cheap sum of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">800 dollars</measure> for the whole concern, I drove off with my bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>The laughter and wonderment which greeted my appearance at headquarters, gravely tooling my carriage and pair up to my tent, may be easily conceived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>This setting up of my carriage became an inexhaustible source of joking and bantering, to which I had to submit with the best grace I could; never did jest wear so well or so long; it outlasted by a long span the poor old carriage, its parent, which, after serving on many a merry expedition with the young ladies of the neighbourhood, gradually succumbed to the shocks of the rough roads and &lsquo;cross-country jaunts; and in a few weeks its frame had, bit by bit, resolved itself into its component parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>Only a heap of ruins at my tent door, and the cushions, which served me excellently for pillows, remained as outward and visible tokens of its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>But the joke lived still, and even <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0008.0019.00340.01226" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, by no means addicted to the jocular vein, would frequently, on parade or in the battle-field, come out with, <quote><rs type="role2">Major</rs>, where's your carriage?</quote>

<p>On the evening of the same day I mounted my grey mule Kitt, the steed I generally selected for night excursions such as that I was bent on, and paid a visit to <placeName><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0008.0019.00340.01227" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, distant not more than a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>With the New Year set in a continuance of bad weather. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>The cold increased, snow and damp alternated in rapid succession, and our poor animals continued exposed to the severest hardships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>As for my own plight, I had returned to my large tent, where I managed by a variety of ingenious shifts, the offspring of hard necessity, to surround myself with not a few practical comforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>A planked floor was laid down, and over it was spread the rough resemblance of a carpet in the shape of a large square of old canvass; a packing-case which had served for the despatch of saddlery from the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">ordnance department</orgName> did duty very efficiently for a bedstead; and with an empty whisky-cask, which, by sawing down on <num value="1">one</num> side to within a foot of the floor, stuffing the bottom with blankets, and leaving only so much of the upper portion as would comfortably support the back, became a capital easychair, my assemblage of <quote>sticks</quote> was by no means contemptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>With the inward man, however, matters began to assume <pb id="p.348" n="348"/> a very unsatisfactory condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>While the <name>Christmas</name> provision could be still eked out, we got on well enough, though at the cost of many an alarm sounded by the vigilant <rs>Bob</rs>, and many a hurried night-chase given to the <rs>Texan</rs> marauders to preserve the turkeys, while any yet survived, to our own use. But when the last of these interesting animals had in due turn adorned the mess-table, the dearth of food which thereafter ensued and continued was most painfully felt by officers and men. The almost invariable message with which our negroes returned from the commissary was, <quote>Nothing to be had;</quote> and when by an extraordinary chance they were enabled to bring back some sort of supplies, these consisted of beef so tough or bacon so rancid that only the sharpest pangs of hunger could induce a human being to tackle it as food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>By using bullets cut into small pieces as a substitute for shot, I managed to bring down with my gun a number of small birds, such as blackbirds, robins, and sparrows, and so to purvey a certain modicum of fresh animal food, but so limited that there was never enough to satisfy the whole company; and often would <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> small birds appear at our long mess-table, to be divided among <num value="12">twelve</num> hungry men, for any <num value="1">one</num> of whom they would have been but a scanty meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion a windfall came to us from the <rs>Lower Rappahannock</rs> (called the <name>Tappahannock</name>), in the shape of a waggon-load of oysters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>These we fed on with great relish for a few days; but, being destitute of salt, pepper, or butter, or any condiment that might replace them, they soon palled, and a delicacy which would have been prized, under other circumstances, beyond all expression, became so nauseous that the very sight of an oyster turned us sick. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>It was a tantalising fact, in the midst of our famine, to know that a flock of sheep existed in the neighbourhood, the property of an old planter, who, however, obstinately refused to part with <num value="1">one</num> of them except at the most exorbitant price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/><pb id="p.349" n="349"/> No entreaties in the world could induce the obdurate old gentleman to abate his demands; and the consequence was, that he ultimately suffered for his greed in the manner we are about to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>Day after day these sheep would be found straying about our camp, attracted by the fodder of our horses, which was not a little diminished by their felonious nibblings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>We had the greatest trouble to prevent these depredations; and, moreover, the sight to our hungry eyes of fat loins enriched at our expense, but on which we were prohibited to feed, added insult to injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>After sending several warnings to the old flockmaster, our couriers hit upon a cunning device, which should at once rid them of a nuisance and procure them delicious mutton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>Deep trenches were dug wherever the sheep were in the habit of trespassing, ostensibly for the protection of our provender; and these, being covered with pine branches and straw, became so many pitfalls into which the poor animals tumbled, rolling over and over, and seldom escaping without such injuries as necessitated their immediate slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>The accident was then notified, not without bitter complaints, to the proprietor, who, having himself no use for the entire carcass, would make the best of the matter by selling us the greater part of the meat; and this mode of purveying mutton lasted till the old planter was persuaded to take better care of his flock. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>In spite of deficient food, scanty supply of blankets, and extreme scarcity of shoe-leather, in the midst of the most trying weather, the good spirits of the army were unabated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>Joyous sounds of song and laughter broke forth continuously from amidst the camps, and the bands of all the different regiments played merrily every evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>A theatre even was erected, where the performances of negro minstrels and other entertainments afforded immense delight to officers and men, and attracted all the young ladies of the neighbourhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>About the middle of the month some interruption to the <pb id="p.350" n="350"/> usual monotonous routine of our camp was made by the visit of <persName n="Bramston,Colonel,,,," id="n0008.0020.00350.01262" reg="mostcommon:Bramston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bramston</surname></persName>, of the battalion of Grenadier Guards stationed in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, with whom I, with great pleasure, shared the accommodation of my tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>Exasperated out of all patience at this, I spurred my horse and dashed with a tremendous leap into the middle of the creek, and for a moment its waters seemed to close over my head; but quickly surmounting the torrent, my brave horse gallantry swam to the opposite shore, and, by a strenuous effort of every sinew, succeeded in scrambling up the steep bank to the high ground above. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>Hour after hour passed away in this trying state of uncertainty, until at last, towards mid-day, the fog cleared away, and we were enabled to discover that our antagonists had for once completely deceived us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>To make quite sure, however, we approached to within about <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure>, and I then called out and asked them to what regiment they belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/><quote>You shall see that soon enough, you d-d rebels,</quote> was the answer, and at the same moment the whole party came full gallop towards us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>Resistance when so completely out-numbered would have been folly; and accordingly I had the pleasure of seeing our General, who had now lost all doubts as to the real character of these cavalrymen, for once run from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> soon slackened their pace, however, and at last gave up the chase altogether, when we halted, and <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0021.00374.01371" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> despatched <persName n="White,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0021.00374.01372" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName> of our Staff to <persName n="Lee,,Fitz,,," id="n0008.0021.00374.01373" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, with the order to send on <num value="1">one</num> of his regiments as quickly as possible, and to follow slowly himself with the remainder of his brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>After an anxious half-hour the regiment came up, and we had the satisfaction of turning the tables on our pursuers and driving them before us as rapidly as we had fled before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>The feeble light of the moon was now nearly extinguished by the clouds scudding rapidly across the sky. <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0008.0021.00374.01374" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and his Staff were trotting along at the head of the column, when, at the moment of emerging out of the dark forest, we suddenly discovered in the open field before us, and at a distance of not <pb id="p.375" n="375"/> more than <measure n="160yards" type="distance">160 yards</measure>, the long lines of several regiments of hostile cavalry, who received us with a severe fire, which, concentrated on the narrow road, in a few moments killed and wounded a large number of our men and horses, causing considerable confusion in our ranks, and speedily checking our onward movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>For once our horsemen refused to follow their gallant commander; they wavered under the thick storm of bullets; soon all discipline ceased, and in a few minutes the greater part of this splendid regiment, which had distinguished itself in so many battle-fields, broke to the rear in utter confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>At this moment the enemy's bugle sounded the charge; and a few seconds after we brunted the shock of the attack, which broke upon us like a thunder-cloud, and bore our little band along with its vehement rush as driven by a mighty wave, sweeping us along with it into the darkness of the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>And now ensued a wild, exciting chase, in which friend and foe, unable to recognise each other, mingled helter-skelter in <num value="1">one</num> furious ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>I cannot describe the sensation that came over me, as, feeling assured that everything was now lost, I tightly grasped the hilt of my sword, resolved to sell my life as dearly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>Relying merely on the instinct of their horses, most of the men followed the straight road by which we had come, but I and a number of others turned off into a small by-road to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>Here I discovered by the gleams of the moonlight, which now broke out more brightly, that those immediately round me were friends, but every effort to stop and rally them was in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>A tremendous fence standing across our path, too high for a leap, and only to be pulled down at the risk of dismounting, seemed likely to bring our wild retreat to a stop; but by dint of rider pressing on rider, and horse plunging against horse, it at last yielded to the accumulated weight of the impetuous horsemen, and broke down with a loud crash, leaving the way open to the disorderly flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>Just as, at the end of a rapid ride of more than an hour through dense forest, I reached an open field, a rider, who had been close at my side for some time, startled me with the exclamation, <quote>Von, is that you?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>Meanwhile we set off with the project of rejoining the rest of the brigade, which, in a dark night and through an unknown and forest-covered country, was a task of some difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>Suddenly a fresh cry of <quote>Here are the <rs>Yankees</rs>; here they come,</quote> broke out from the men around me as they fired off their revolvers into the bushes to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>Calling on them to follow, I spurred my horse forward in the same direction, when, at the same moment, I was met by a rider galloping towards me, who levelled a shot at me so close, the bullet passing through my hat, that I was completely blinded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>After a few hours' sleep I was awakened about day-break by the sound of several cannon-shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>In an instant I was on my legs, and stepping out of my tent I distinctly heard a brisk firing of small-arms in the direction of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>An orderly shortly afterwards rode up, reporting that the enemy, under cover of the fog, had suddenly fallen upon our pickets, had crossed the river in strong force at several points, and pressed forward so rapidly that they had come upon <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0008.0024.00414.01550" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> before the greater part of the men had had time to saddle their horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>It was fortunate that the sharpshooters of this command, seconded by a section of our <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse-artillery</orgName>, were enabled by a well-directed fire to impede the movements of the attacking foe, so as to give our regiments time to form, and by falling back some distance to take up a position further to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>The General wished to march with his whole force against the enemy, and fight them wherever he might meet them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>My proposal was to place the greater part of the corps and our <num value="24">24</num> guns on the heights, and wait there till the designs of the <rs>Yankees</rs>, who were still hidden by the woods, and their numbers, should be more clearly disclosed, and then, by offering a feint with a few of our advanced brigades, to draw them towards us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>A scene of disgraceful stampede ensued-single horsemen galloped off the field in all directions, waggons and ambulances which had been detained to carry off camp utensils rattled over the ground, while with loud shouts of victory a dense mass of Federal horsemen broke froth from the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>Just as the confusion was at its height, my eye alighted on my little mule Kitt, on which <num value="1">one</num> of the waggoners was mounted, and was passing me at full speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>The temptation to recover this valuable piece of property was not to be withstood, even under the exciting circumstances of the occasion; and quickly overtaking the fellow, I ordered him to give up my property, but the fear of falling into the hands of the enemy so possessed the poor devil that he begged to be <pb id="p.416" n="416"/> allowed to bring it back to me at headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>Thinking, however, it was only a just punishment on him to let him make good his escape by the aid of his own legs, I made him dismount, and sent Kitt to the rear by <num value="1">one</num> of the couriers who accompanied me, where <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> greeted the return of his favourite with every mark of delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>All our brigades having now arrived from the more distant camps, our line of battle, nearly <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> in length, could be regularly formed; and along the woods which border the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> the multitudinous firing of our dismounted sharpshooters sounded like the rattle of musketry in a regular battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>We held our ground tolerably well for some time, but it soon became evident that the enemy were in far superior numbers and supported by infantry, large columns of which were reported by <persName n="Lee,,William,,," id="n0008.0024.00416.01556" reg="default:Lee,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who commanded on our extreme left, to be crossing the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>From some stragglers who galloped past me as I approached the station, I gathered, in a confused way, that the <rs>Federals</rs> were in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>To this report I gave little credit, but on <pb id="p.417" n="417"/> emerging from the forest I found that they had only spoken the truth, for there a sight awaited me which made the blood run cold in my veins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/>The heights of Brandy and the spot where our headquarters had been were perfectly swarming with <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, while the men of <num value="1">one</num> of our brigades were scattered wide over the plateau, chased in all directions by their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>Seeing <num value="1">one</num> of our regiments still in line, but already swerving and on the point of breaking, I rode up to the <rs>Colonel</rs>, who seemed to have lost all presence of mind, and threatened to arrest him on the spot, and to prefer a charge of cowardice against him, if he did not at once lead his men on to the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/>This had the desired effect, and with a faint cheer the regiment galloped forward against the enemy; but <num value="2">two</num> hostile regiments starting to meet us, the space we were charging over diminished with increasing rapidity, until at last, when only a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> apart, our disheartened soldiers broke and fled in shameful confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/>Carried along for a moment by the torrent of fugitives, I perceived that we were hastening towards an opening in a fence which had been made to facilitate the movements of our artillery, and, soon outstripping the rest by the fleetness of my charger, I reached the gap, and placed myself in the centre, calling out to them that I would kill every man who tried to pass me, and knocking over with the flat of my sabre <num value="2">two</num> of those who had ventured too near me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>and, putting spurs into my charger's flanks, the noble animal bounded forth against the <rs>Federals</rs>, who were now close upon us, but whose lines, by the length of the pursuit, had become very loose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>The very same men, however, who had fought so gallantly with me before had lost <pb id="p.418" n="418"/> all self-confidence, and after following me a short distance, they turned again to flight, abruptly leaving me quite alone in the midst of the charging foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>Not heeding this summons, I urged my horse to its highest speed; and now turning to the rear myself, and clearing the fence at a part where it was too high for them to follow, I soon left my pursuers far behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>I had not galloped many <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> further, however, when I overtook <persName n="White,Captain,,,," id="n0008.0024.00418.01561" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName> of our Staff, who had received a shot-wound in his neck, and was so weak as scarcely to be able to keep himself up in the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>As I had felt rather ashamed <pb id="p.427" n="427"/> at having been forced to run from the enemy under the very eyes of my fair friends, and was naturally anxious to afford them a spectacle of a totally different character, I assumed my place of honour, leading the charge with <persName n="Robertson,General,,,," id="n0008.0025.00427.01607" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, and to my intense satisfaction plunged into the enemy's ranks opposite the precise spot whence I had commenced my flight, and whence, regardless of danger, the ladies now looked on and watched the progress of the combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>The enemy in strong force were advancing upon a patch of wood about a mile from <placeName reg="Middleburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2113008">Middleburg</placeName>, which was held by our troops, consisting of <persName n="Robertson,,,,," id="n0008.0025.00429.01617" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Lee,,William,,," id="n0008.0025.00429.01618" reg="default:Lee,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s commands; the dismounted sharpshooters on both sides were exchanging a lively fire, and the shells from a number of hostile batteries were bursting with a sharp crack in the tree-tops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3359"/>I then rode forward to the extreme front, and, carefully reconnoitring the position of the enemy, I found that their force was far superior to our own, and that they were overlapping us on either wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>Just as I reached our breaking lines, the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA9">9th Virginia</orgName>, which had been in reserve, dashed forward in a magnificent charge; the batteries <orgName type="company" n="Battery I">I</orgName> had previously posted opened a well-directed cross-fire on the <rs>Federal</rs> horsemen; the flying regiments responded to my call, and turned upon their pursuers, whom we drove rapidly back into the woods, killing and wounding a large number, and taking many prisoners, until a severe fusillade from the enemy's sharpshooters, posted on the outskirts of the wood, protected their retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>I had just succeeded in re-forming our own men, about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">200 yards</measure> from the woods, when <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0008.0025.00430.01625" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Hardeman,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> came up, and, riding along the lines of his troops, who always felt relieved by his appearance in the moment of extreme danger, was received by them with enthusiastic cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>He now ordered the regiments to withdraw by squadrons to a better position &mdash; a movement which was executed under cover of a spirited fire from our batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>After a few moments of insensibility, I opened my eyes again, to find myself lying on the ground, my charger beside me, and a number of officers and men pressing round and endeavouring to raise me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>Unable to speak, I motioned to my comrades to leave me, and save themselves from the hail of bullets the enemy were concentrating on them, <num value="2">two</num> of the soldiers about me having already fallen lifeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>After a painful ride of more than a mile, coming across an ambulance, my comrades placed me in it, gave <pb id="p.432" n="432"/> orders to the driver to carry me further to the rear, and then galloped off in another direction in search of our surgeon, <persName n="Eliason,,Dr,,," id="n0008.0025.00432.01629" reg="default:Eliason,Dr,,,"><foreName>Dr</foreName> <surname>Eliason</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>At last I could stand it no longer, and, crawling up to him, I put my cocked pistol to his head, and made him understand that I should blow out his brains if he continued his cowardly flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>This proved effectual, and, driving along at a moderate pace, we were overtaken by <persName n="Eliason,,Dr,,," id="n0008.0025.00432.01630" reg="default:Eliason,Dr,,,"><foreName>Dr</foreName> <surname>Eliason</surname></persName>, who at once examined my wound, and found that the ball had entered the lower part of my neck, cut through a portion of the windpipe, and, taking a downward course, had lodged somewhere in my right lung, and that my left arm was entirely paralysed by the same shot.

<p>In the early part of the forenoon the fighting re-commenced, the thunder of the cannon and the rattle of musketry sounded closer and closer, wounded men and stragglers began to pass through the village, and I became more and more nervous and excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>It was certainly a moment of no small excitement, when, after a cordial leave-taking with my kind host, I was carried by my friends to the ambulance, in the midst of shells bursting in the streets and crashing through the house-tops, fugitives rushing wildly by, wounded men crawling out of the way, riderless horses galloping distractedly about, whilst close at hand were heard the triumphant shouts of the pursuing foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/>The sound of our light guns, which I recognised so well, did not fail to rouse me into a state of excitement; and as an old war-horse prances and curvets at <pb id="p.442" n="442"/> the shrill ringing of the trumpet, I felt the blood pour like electric fire through my veins, and rushed about in feverish uneasiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3447"/>I fancied I heard my sword rattling in its scabbard to summon me to the scene of conflict by my <rs type="role2">General</rs>'s side; but, as I was separated from my own chargers, I tried to borrow a horse for the occasion from <num value="1">one</num> of my many friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>The rapid run and the excitement of my pursuit had proved too much for my strength, and I had scarcely reached the outskirts of the town when, as I approached a friend's house, the blood began to stream from my mouth, and I was carried, half fainting, to my temporary domicile at <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> P.&lsquo;s, where I was immediately put to bed.
