<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>For <measure n="34years" type="date">thirty-four years</measure> I have waited patiently for some <num value="1">one</num> to write a history of the <orgName type="regiment" key="19MAVolunteer">19th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers</orgName>, but fearing that it may never be accomplished, I have concluded to send out this story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>I do not dignify it by calling it a history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It is simply a soldier's story, told by <num value="1">one</num> of the <quote>boys.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Most of it is written from memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The account of prison life is taken from an imperfect diary, kept by the writer while a prisoner of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>I sincerely hope the publication of this volume will inspire other comrades, and that from the memories thus evoked some <num value="1">one</num> may gather further material whereby the deeds of the men who so bravely followed the flags of the <rs>State</rs> and Nation for <num value="4">four</num> long, weary years may be preserved.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>At the breaking out of the war I was a resident of the quiet but patriotic town of <placeName reg="Groveland, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049857">Groveland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> had been fired upon and all was excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I could not work, and on the <dateStruct value="1861-04-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> walked to <placeName reg="Haverhill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049885">Haverhill</placeName> with my elder brother and Mark <persName n="Kimball,,,,," id="n0168.0003.00001.00003" reg="mostcommon:Kimball,nomatch:0"><surname>Kimball</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We went to the armory of the <rs>Hale Guards</rs>, who were making active preparations to march, and I returned home that night resolved to go with them if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The next day we walked to <placeName reg="Haverhill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049885">Haverhill</placeName> again, and I at once interviewed <persName n="Messer,Captain,,,," id="n0168.0003.00001.00004" reg="mostcommon:Messer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Messer</surname></persName>, but was informed that the company was more than full, so I could not go with it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I had said nothing to my brother or Mark of my intention, but as we were walking home I found that we all had the same desire,--to enlist at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We talked the matter over and concluded that as <orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1BattalionRifles">1st Battalion of Rifles</orgName>, an old militia company located in <placeName key="tgn,2050913" n="1.000 8" reg="west newbury, essex county, massachusetts">West Newbury</placeName>, and then under arms, would soon be ordered away, we would join it. That night we walked to <placeName><placeName key="tgn,2050913" n="1.000 8" reg="west newbury, essex county, massachusetts">West Newbury</placeName> (<distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance>)</placeName>, found the company at the armory in the town hall and enrolled our names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName> was <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="3">three</num> that composed the <orgName type="regiment" key="1BattalionRifles">1st Battalion of Rifles</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Poore,Major,Benjamin,Perley,," id="n0168.0003.00001.00005" reg="default:Poore,Benjamin,Perley,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <foreName n="Benjamin">Ben.</foreName> <foreName>Perley</foreName> <surname>Poore</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They had been organized several <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> years and were known as <quote><persName n="Poore,,,,," id="n0168.0003.00002.00006" reg="nearbymention:Poore,Benjamin,Perley,,"><surname>Poore</surname></persName>'s Savages.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They were armed with <persName n="Winsor,,,,," id="n0168.0003.00002.00007" reg="mostcommon:Winsor,nomatch:0"><surname>Winsor</surname></persName> rifles and sabre bayonets, the rifle and bayonet weighing about <measure n="15l." type="pounds"><num value="15">fifteen</num> pounds</measure>. The uniform was dark green, trimmed with light green, and as I donned it for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time it was hard to tell which was the greener, the soldier or the uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We had a peculiar drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Most of it, as I can remember, consisted of running around the town hall in single file, giving an Indian war-whoop and firing into the corner of the hall as we ran.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I was a soldier now. I did not walk the streets as I had done, but <hi rend="italics">marched</hi>, always turning <quote>a square corner.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>People grasped me by the hand and congratulated me on my courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>(I did not see where the courage came in.) The <orgName n="Sons of Temperance" type="association">Sons of Temperance</orgName>, of which my <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> and myself were members, presented us at a public meeting with <num value="2">two</num> suits of underclothes and havelocks, housewives, testaments, etc., so that before we received our army outfit we had enough to load a mule.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>We waited for orders to march, but none came, and from being heroes we began to be looked upon with disgust, and we were the most disgusted of all. As we would meet friends on the street they would say, <quote>Is it not about time to have another public meeting to bid you fellows good-by?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>or, <quote>You will want some more shirts before you leave.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>So mortified did we become that, instead of marching down through the village to drill, we sneaked away through a back street.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The company began to get demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Men were leaving every day, going to other States or to regiments that had been ordered to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>At last we rebelled, and sent our officers to the <rs>Governor</rs> with a vote passed by the company, <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> that unless we were ordered into camp at once we would disband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>After a few days we were furnished with a large tent for the men, a wall tent for the officers and a supply of rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Our camp was located on the land of <num value="1">one</num> of our members, <persName n="Sylvester,Private,,,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sylvester,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Private">Private</roleName> <surname>Sylvester</surname></persName>, and was named <quote><placeName reg="Camp Sylvester">Camp Sylvester</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We were without arms except <num value="3">three</num> guns for guard duty, as our old Winsors had been turned in. <orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName> was officered as follows: <persName n="Stanwood,Captain,Moses,P.,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00009" reg="default:Stanwood,Moses,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName>, <foreName>Moses</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Stanwood</surname></persName>; <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">First Lieutenant</rs>, <persName n="Brown,,J.,Warren,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00010" reg="default:Brown,J.,Warren,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>Warren</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>; <persName n="Wilson,Lieutenant-2,Benjamin,,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00011" reg="default:Wilson,Benjamin,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-2">Second Lieutenant</roleName>, <foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>; <persName n="Boyd,Lieutenant-3,Isaac,H.,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00012" reg="default:Boyd,Isaac,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-3">Third Lieutenant</roleName>, <foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Boyd</surname></persName>; <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-4">Fourth Lieutenant</rs>, <persName n="Frankle,,Jones,,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00013" reg="default:Frankle,Jones,,,"><foreName>Jones</foreName> <surname>Frankle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> and fourth lieutenants were soon discharged, as army regulations only provided for <num value="2">two</num>. <persName n="Boyd,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00014" reg="nearbymention:Boyd,Isaac,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Boyd</surname></persName> went into the ranks, <persName n="Frankle,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00015" reg="nearbymention:Frankle,Jones,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Frankle</surname></persName> was made major of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA17">17th Massachusetts</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Our discipline in <placeName reg="Camp Sylvester">Camp Sylvester</placeName> was not as strict as it was later in the war. We mounted <num value="1">one</num> guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>After we had been once around we concluded that the lieutenants ought to stand their share, so we put them on. <num value="1">One</num> night we caught a calf and after the officers were asleep we turned him into their tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We did many things that later would have sent us to the guard-house.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>About the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> week in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> we were ordered to <placeName key="tgn,2050046" n="1.000 14" reg="lynnfield, essex county, massachusetts">Lynnfield</placeName> to join the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 19">19th regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We were the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Company">second company</orgName> in camp, <orgName type="company" n="Company C">Company C</orgName> of <persName n="Rowley,,,,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00016" reg="mostcommon:Rowley,nomatch:0"><surname>Rowley</surname></persName> arriving about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> before us. Our tents were a peculiar pattern, neither wall nor A, but between the <num value="2">two</num>, having accommodations for <num value="10">ten</num> men, and each tent had <num value="3">three</num> windows or ventilators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>For a time we were under the command of <persName n="Dyke,Colonel,Lyman,,," id="n0168.0003.00003.00017" reg="default:Dyke,Lyman,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Lyman</foreName> <surname>Dyke</surname></persName>, who also commanded the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 17">17th regiment</orgName>, located near us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At <placeName key="tgn,2050046" n="1.000 14" reg="lynnfield, essex county, massachusetts">Lynnfield</placeName> I was promoted to <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> corporal, and my troubles began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I was <num value="1">one</num> day detailed for guard, the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 19">19th regiments</orgName> doing guard duty together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>When I posted my relief I had <num value="1">one</num> more man than posts, so I made a new post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The officer of the day asked me what I did with the supernumerary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I said that I put him on in rear of the ice-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He desired to know who gave me authority to create new posts, and I replied that I supposed I was to use up my men. As soon as the guards were posted they began to call <quote><rs type="role" reg="Corporal">Corporal</rs> of the guard.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>When I went to them they wanted a drink of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I asked the officer of the day if it was my duty to carry water to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He said it was. So I toted the water pail the <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> my relief was on. At night the men went to their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I found where they slept, and made arrangements to call them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I would put my head into a tent and call, <quote><num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num> relief!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>and instead of the men coming out, a boot with an oath came at me. As I could not get enough for a relief I turned out the drummer and had him beat the long roll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This brought out the officer of the day but very few of the men, as they did not know what it meant any more than I did. Collecting what I could we started to relieve the guard, but I soon found that I had more than men enough, as at nearly every post we found the musket stuck into the ground and the man missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>When relieved in the morning I was disgusted with being an officer, and longed for the freedom of a private.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Recruits were fast arriving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName> went into camp with about <num value="60">sixty</num> men, and every day some new man was voted in, as we had not given up the old militia method of electing our members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Skeleton companies were arriving, consisting of an officer and a few men, who were given a letter and assigned a place in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to arrive was <persName n="Mahoney,Captain,,,," id="n0168.0003.00004.00018" reg="mostcommon:Mahoney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mahoney</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>His company was given the <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> letter E. <persName n="Mahoney,Captain,,,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00019" reg="mostcommon:Mahoney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mahoney</surname></persName> was an energetic officer and anxious to drill his men. Long before daybreak, with his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sergeant, <persName n="McNamara,,,,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00020" reg="mostcommon:McNamara,nomatch:0"><surname>McNamara</surname></persName>, he would turn out the recruits, and as we lay in our tents we could hear him calling, <quote>Left!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Left! <persName n="McNamara,,,,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00021" reg="mostcommon:McNamara,nomatch:0"><surname>McNamara</surname></persName>, tread on that man's heels!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It was not very long before we had the required number of companies, the last to arrive being the <rs>Boston Tiger Fire Zouaves</rs>, and my story from this point will include the regiment as well as <orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/><num value="1">One</num> day in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> we saw a military man looking over the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We soon learned that it was <persName n="Hincks,Colonel,,,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00022" reg="mostcommon:Hincks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hincks</surname></persName>, who had just returned from <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> service with the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA8">8th Massachusetts</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>In a few days he was assigned to the command of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> and from that moment what had been a uniformed mob became a regiment of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>With him came <persName n="Devereaux,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00023" reg="nearbymention:Devereaux,Charles,U.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Devereaux</surname></persName>, who had been captain of the <rs>Salem Zouaves</rs>, and soon after <persName n="Henry,Major,,,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00024" reg="mostcommon:Henry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Henry</surname></persName> J.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <rs>Salem Zouaves</rs> was assigned to each company as a drill-master, and we soon saw that our <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> drilling had been worse than useless, as we had to begin over again, and it <quote>was hard to teach old dogs new tricks;</quote> but the <name>Zouaves</name> won our respect and every man was anxious to do his best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Very soon a change took place in the line officers,--a Zouave was commissioned in nearly every company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName> retained <persName n="Stanwood,Captain,,,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00025" reg="nearbymention:Stanwood,Moses,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Stanwood</surname></persName>, but lost both lieutenants, <persName n="Merritt,,C.,M.,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00026" reg="default:Merritt,C.,M.,,"><foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Merritt</surname></persName>, who had been an officer in the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>, being made first lieutenant, and <persName n="Boyd,,Isaac,H.,," id="n0168.0003.00005.00027" reg="default:Boyd,Isaac,H.,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Boyd</surname></persName>, who had enlisted as a private, <rs type="role" n="Lieutenant-2">second lieutenant</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>On <dateStruct value="-08-27"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="27">27</day></dateStruct> we were ordered to strike tents and prepare to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>That night, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, we slept on the ground, with only the blue sky for shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The next day <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> we took cars for <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Our knapsacks were slung for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time and loaded with everything that it was possible to stow away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Being anxious that my <quote>best girl</quote> should see me in the full garb of a warrior, I arrayed myself in heavy marching order and went to an ambrotype saloon to have my picture taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>I have seen that picture since the war. In an ambrotype everything is reversed, so my musket is at my left shoulder, haversack and canteen on the wrong side,--in fact, I was wrong end to in every respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Our wagon train was larger than that of an <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> in active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Each company had a <orgName type="regiment" key="4Cav">four-horse</orgName> wagon, headquarters <num value="2">two</num>, quartermaster <num value="4">four</num>; I think there were <num value="20">twenty</num> besides the ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We arrived in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time I had been in the city, and as we halted on the <name>Common</name>, and no friend came to bid me good-by, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> feeling of homesickness came over me, and I began to realize that at last we were real soldiers and that the enjoyments of camp life at home were fast falling to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>We went to New York by the <placeName key="tgn,2604119" n="1.000 91" reg="fall river, bristol county, massachusetts">Fall River</placeName> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>I had never been on a steamboat before and was very sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Landing in New York, we marched up <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>My knapsack weighed a ton and I was so sick that I could not hold up my head, yet dared not fall out for fear I should get lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>We were marched to a barrack and given some thin soup and a testament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I had already <num value="2">two</num> testaments in my knapsack, but I took this, although I wished they had put a little more money in the soup and passed the testament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I do not remember what route we took from New York, but we went part of the way by boat and arrived in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> the next morning. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>We marched to that place and found a nice breakfast served by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ladies of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>This was the only home-like meal we had received since leaving <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and our hearts went out to the loyal people, and our thanks were expressed in <num value="3">three</num> rousing cheers for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>About the middle of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> we broke camp and took up our line of march for our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>We bade good-by to our tents, which had sheltered us since we left <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and sent them to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> with our extra personal baggage, where I expect they are to-day, as we never received them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>We marched to the river, then up the towpath of the canal to <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, forded the <rs>Potomac</rs> at <placeName key="possibilities=31" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Point of Rocks</placeName>, and for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time our feet pressed the sacred soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>We saw here the devastations of war,--the ruins of the old arsenal that had been burned by the rebels, the dilapidated and vacant houses,--but most interesting to us was the old engine-house, where <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0168.0006.00023.00086" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> made his gallant fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>This we found filled with rebel prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>As soon as arms were stacked we rushed to the arsenal ruins for relics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>I found an old gun-lock and several other parts of muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>These I packed in my knapsack,--and the next day threw them away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>With other regiments we marched up the valley to join <orgName n="division"><persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0168.0006.00023.00087" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, and bivouacked at <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> in the field where <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0168.0006.00023.00088" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> was hanged.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Somehow the keg of gin disappeared; where it had gone no <num value="1">one</num> knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The next day was our last in town, having been ordered to join the regiment quite early in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>I noticed some of the men were very happy, but as we had been called by the other companies <quote><orgName n="Sabbath School" type="school"><persName n="Merritt,,,,," id="n0168.0006.00024.00091" reg="mostcommon:Merritt,C.,M.,,:1"><surname>Merritt</surname></persName>'s Sabbath school</orgName> children,</quote> I thought it possible they were rehearsing for a <orgName n="Sabbath School" type="school">Sabbath school</orgName> concert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The increase of the <hi rend="italics">spiritual</hi> manifestations told me that the cause of the inspiration must be the gin, and that it was not far away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>After searching awhile I found the missing keg in the cellar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Unlike many of the men, it was nearly empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>In the midst of the seance <persName n="Merritt,Captain,,,," id="n0168.0006.00024.00092" reg="mostcommon:Merritt,C.,M.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Merritt</surname></persName> arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>When he saw the condition of some of the men I guess he thought we had better move in ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>As it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offence the men were let <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> off with a lecture from the captain, and as the opportunity was never again presented, the offence was not repeated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>A fine band was attached to the regiment, and having become very well drilled in the manual, our dress parades were almost perfect, and were witnessed by nearly all the soldiers and citizens in the town.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/><dateStruct value="-03-24"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="24">24</day></dateStruct> we received marching orders.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>In no place is the life of a soldier so hard as on a transport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Crowded between decks like cattle, unable to cook or even make coffee, they must subsist on what rations are issued and drink the water from the casks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The crews are always liberally supplied with miserable whiskey, which they sell at a high price to those who will buy, and a few men are always found in every regiment who will get drunk if they have a chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>On shore the guard-house can be resorted to, but on board ship there is no relief from this unbearable nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>I do not want it understood that drunkenness was general in the army, for many men went through the war without touching liquor, and in my <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> experience I never saw an officer or enlisted man intoxicated when going into battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>I believe that what was true during the war has been true since, and that in no <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> organization &mdash; not temperance &mdash; can be found so many total abstainers to the number of men as can be found in the ranks of the <orgName n="Grand Army of the Republic" type="association">Grand Army of the Republic</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Our trip down the <rs>Potomac</rs> was pleasant, but soon after leaving the river a sudden storm struck us; our old craft leaked badly and we feared we should be swamped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The captain dared not continue, and put back to <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Here we found a deserted hotel and several cottages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>We did not stop to register, but took possession of the rooms and passed a comfortable night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Next morning we reembarked, and reached <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The following day we landed and marched to <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>, where we found the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> awaiting the arrival of our division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>We encamped here about <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, quartered in <persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n0168.0006.00026.00095" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,nomatch:0"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>We were not required to drill often, and the time was pleasantly passed in visiting the several <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 17" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> regiments in the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Early in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> the grand <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> moved towards <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It <hi rend="italics">was a grand army</hi>, every regiment having its full quota.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The experience of the previous months had made them reliable as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Incompetent officers and disabled men had been discharged, and those now on duty were filled with patriotic enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>They only desired a chance to fight, clear up the war and go home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Every man had confidence in <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0168.0006.00026.00096" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, and almost believed that he was sent by the <rs>Lord</rs> to lead us to victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Whenever he appeared every head was uncovered and every voice raised in loud hurrahs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>We marched <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> and encamped about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from the enemy's works before <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>We pitched our shelter tents for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, and began army life in <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Our rations were served to us uncooked, and company cooks ordered to the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>A company cook is a peculiar being; he generally knows less about cooking than any man in the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Not being able to learn the drill, and too dirty to appear on inspection, he is sent to the cook house to get him out of the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We were not sorry when the cook house was abolished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day after our arrival the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="20MARegiment">20th Massachusetts regiments</orgName>, under command of <persName n="Dana,General,,,," id="n0168.0006.00027.00097" reg="mostcommon:Dana,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName>, were ordered to reconnoitre the enemy's works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>We discovered a fortification near <placeName reg="Winn's Mill">Winn's Mill</placeName>, and the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> was ordered to march through a piece of woods, then along the front, and discern its extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>We did this under a sharp fire of musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>It was not our intention to attack, but as <orgName type="company" n="Company E">Company E</orgName>, commanded by the brave but impulsive <persName n="Mahoney,Captain,,,," id="n0168.0006.00027.00098" reg="mostcommon:Mahoney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mahoney</surname></persName>, was fired upon, he ordered the men to charge the works, and would have done so had not <persName n="Hincks,Colonel,,,," id="n0168.0006.00027.00099" reg="mostcommon:Hincks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hincks</surname></persName> recalled him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The regiment behaved splendidly under fire; when the musketry was the hottest the clear voice of <persName n="Hincks,Colonel,,,," id="n0168.0006.00027.00100" reg="mostcommon:Hincks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hincks</surname></persName> was heard.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>We went into camp and began to erect fortifications; for nearly a month we were engaged in-that work, besides building corduroy roads and doing picket duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Our camp was located in a swamp; the rain was almost constant, and the ground like a sponge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Sickness prevailed to an alarming extent; it was not an uncommon thing to march half of the company to sick call, but not all who went were sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Active service had tired some who, when we were in camp in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, were anxious to fight, and were constantly grumbling because we were not ordered in. Picket duty under fire had given these few the <quote>shell fever.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Loss of voice was the trouble with many, caused by severe colds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Such cases were the exception, however, and every day the number grew less, as our men were ordered back to general hospital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The works we were erecting were of the strongest kind, as it was intended to besiege <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, and the heaviest guns were mounted for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Every indication of a hasty retreat was shown, as in the camps in the rear of the works we found fires and breakfast smoking hot, which we eagerly disposed of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>How to draw the bean soup was the question, as we had nothing to draw it in. <persName n="McGinnis,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0168.0014.00109.00435" reg="mostcommon:McGinnis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>McGinnis</surname></persName> was in rear of me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>We did not touch the bacon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>Hungry as we were the smell satisfied us. We went upstairs and sat down to dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>We rode all day without food or water, and found ourselves the next morning at <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>Outside the cars were hucksters selling bread, pies and fruit, and the sight made us wild.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>Men opened the windows, took rings from their fingers, and sold them for loaves of bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>At <time value="12pm">noon</time> we were ordered out of the car, and after some delay rations were issued, consisting of <num value="20">twenty</num> small hard tack and a small piece of bacon not properly cured and covered with maggots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>They marched us <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, and camped for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>The sun was so hot that most of my bacon melted and ran down my back, but the maggots still lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>We were commanded by a major who had lost an arm in the service, and had also been a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>We could get along very well with the men, but the boys were anxious to shoot a Yankee, and we had to keep our eyes <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>Our march was through a splendid country and the days were fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>We had many good singers among the officers, and as we marched through a village they would strike up a song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>I saw several women who were watching us wipe away tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>Whether the tears were of sympathy for us, or because the scene recalled loved ones in the rebel army, we did not know, but it was the only manifestation of anything but hate I ever saw from a rebel woman.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>Just before we went into camp <num value="1">one</num> night a citizen walked beside us for a short distance and I saw him exchange glances with <persName n="Hume,Captain,,,," id="n0168.0014.00113.00441" reg="mostcommon:Hume,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hume</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>At night we were taken out and marched to the depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>Although it was the anniversary of our nation's birth we saw no demonstrations of any kind, and I do not believe that a citizen of the town knew it was a national holiday; but we remembered it, and while waiting for the train to be made up sung <orgName n="Star Spangled Banner" type="newspaper">Star Spangled Banner</orgName> and other patriotic songs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>We collected quite a crowd, but they manifested no interest, only stood and looked at us.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>We lay our heads on each other's shoulders and tried to sleep, but it was too hot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stockade we had seen, and while our names were being taken and we were being searched I had a chance to examine it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>A walk was built around it for the guard, and at each corner was placed a piece of artillery, which commanded the inside of the prison.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>The door swung open and we were marched in. Had we entered the lower regions we could not have been more horrified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>Nearly all the officers had assembled at the gate, and such a looking set,--half naked, unshaven and unshorn, some dragging themselves along by the aid of sticks, others lying down in the dirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time my courage failed me, and my heart grew faint as I thought that I must pass through what they had already seen of prison life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>We were divided into companies of <num value="32">thirty-two</num>, each commanded by a captain, and subdivided into squads of <num value="8">eight</num>, commanded by a sergeant; the privates only knew the sergeants, the sergeant knew his captain and the captain the <name>Council</name> of <num value="10">Ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>We had signs, passwords, grips and signals, and a grand rallying cry. We were ordered to provide ourselves with clubs if they could be obtained, or in place of them have a stone located where we could easily get it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>It was strange to me why this organization was required, but I was informed that traitors were in the camp, that several tunnels had been started, and when ready to open, the rebels would come in, go directly to them, and driving down a crowbar would find them the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>It was hard to believe that any Union officer would betray his comrades, and we concluded that the rebels must have some of their <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> men in with us, at any rate our leaders thought that a secret organization was necessary for our protection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>A good part of the time was taken by the rebels in finding out if any had escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>Every day the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officers</rs> with the guard would come in and drive us to <num value="1">one</num> side of the prison, then back in single file between <num value="2">two</num> guards, counting us as we passed through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>The rebel officer in charge came in, said that exchange had been agreed upon and that all would soon go, but only <num value="600">six hundred</num> would go that day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>As all who went out were not members of our own order we were directed to tie a string in our button-holes so that we could be recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>We were marched to the station and placed in box cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>Our sergeant posted <num value="2">two</num> men over each guard in the car, with orders to seize and tie them when the signal was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>This was to be a red light shown from the forward car.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>Thus far everything had worked well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>The guards in our car had not a cartridge left in their boxes, as we had taken them all out and had been able to take some of the caps off their muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>We were as determined a body of men as ever lived, and it would have been liberty or death with most of us. Some in our car had been over the road and knew where we were expected to begin work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>We waited for the signal, but it was not shown, and we began to get uneasy as it was evident that we had passed the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>Some jumped from the cars, but we were so near <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> they were recaptured and arrived in the city as soon as we did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>We did not know why we had been sent there but in every heart was a hope that it might be an exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>They marched us through the city down into the burned district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>As we halted on <num value="1">one</num> of the streets a woman on the sidewalk said to me, <quote>I don't think they will put you way down under the fire.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation I had received of what they intended to do with us, but it soon became known that we were to be placed under the fire of our batteries on <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>The noble qualities of the southern chivalry were being shown to us every day, yet this was the most cowardly act of all,--to place unarmed men under the fire of their own guns.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>We continued the march to the jail and were turned into the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>I was more wealthy than when we left <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>He would change it from <num value="1">one</num> hand to another, and at last set it down, as he could carry it no farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>I was in light marching order and as soon as it touched the ground I picked it up and carried it into our new prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>I also had a broken <rs n="water pitcher" type="product">water pitcher</rs> that the guard had allowed me to take out of the gutter, so I had meal and a dish to mix it in.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>We found the jail yard a filthy place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>The only cooking utensils we had were those brought from <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>, and were not half enough to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>The jail was filled with all classes of criminals, male and female, and, with the exception of the women, all were allowed in the yard during some portion of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>After a while sinks were dug, and the lines extended so as to take in the brook that ran in the rear of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>Nearly all the men were barefoot, and it was laughable to see us wash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>We stood in the water, which was very cold,. and danced while we washed our faces and hands.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>Besides our other troubles we were in constant fear of being shot by the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>A doubt being expressed he drew up his piece and fired, with the result as stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>Another time an officer was waiting with his axe on his shoulder to go out for wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>He was standing several feet from the dead line when the guard fired,--killing him instantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>We made every possible effort to have the rebel officers take some action that would prevent our comrades from being murdered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>The guard who did the shooting was relieved <num value="1">one</num> day, and the next appeared on duty on the front line of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>As far as we could learn he was never reprimanded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>The presidential election was drawing near, and was the subject for discussion in the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>He had been sick, and his hair had fallen from his head; he looked like the <quote>priest all shaven and shorn</quote> as he walked about the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>I was not so fortunate, as I drew only a handkerchief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>The wardrobes of all required replenishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>I wore the same shirt I had on when captured, and although it had not been washed oftener than was necessary it was too thin for comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>My light blue pants were worn at the knees and fringed at the bottoms, so I cut off the skirts of my dark blue coat to repair them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>My hat was open at the top and the rim was nearly separated from the crown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>I found an old piece of tent and made a new crown, and with the thread raveled out of the canvas sewed on the rim. My boots were worn out, and my feet were bare.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>A wild boar rushed out of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>It passed the guard and came into camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>Without waiting to dress it, he began cutting off pieces and throwing them to the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>The smell of fried pork soon pervaded the camp, and in <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> after the boar passed the guard every particle was devoured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>Once in a while an officer would trade for a little meat, and while they did not entertain company frequently they sometimes gave banquets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>After the right had been counted we would skip down through the camp and fall in on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>In that way we made our number good, but so many were recaptured and brought &mdash; back that they mistrusted what we were doing, and made us stand in line until all were counted. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>We kept with the other prisoners until we reached the woods, then pretending that we saw our party over a little hill started to join them, and entering a place where the bushes were thick, dropped and waited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>There were several details <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> out for wood, and that was no doubt the reason why the guard did not stop us when we went to join our imaginary squad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>They soon marched in and passed very near us, but we were not noticed, and waited for darkness before we moved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>We had a small map of the country and knew the route we wanted to take, but how to strike it was the question, as the night was dark and we did not have the stars to guide us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/><persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> came up, and we ate the first square meal we had seen for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>We then formed in single file, the negro in the advance, and had gone but a short distance when we heard voices, so we went into the woods while he kept the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>It proved to be some of our old guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>They asked the negro who went into the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>We had lost our guide before we had found our road, but continued on until we came to a broad avenue, and taking that walked as fast as possible for several hours, finally coming to a steep bank at the end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>We struck across the country and near daylight came upon a plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>Very soon the boy returned with the brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>He was pleased to see us, shook hands and requested us to follow him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>We entered the house, and retired with our clothes on, in the bed just vacated by the man and wife.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>On the other side we met a negro, who gave us valuable information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>We walked all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>The country was so open that when daylight came we could find no place to hide, and as a last resort went into a barn, and covering ourselves with hay, were soon fast asleep; but our slumbers were disturbed by an old man who came in to feed the cattle, and for their fodder took our covering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>He appeared satisfied, however, and put us on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>We had gone but a short distance when we heard the barking of dogs, and knowing if the bloodhounds were on our track it was good-by liberty, we entered a brook and travelled up stream several miles to throw them off the scent, then came out and lay in the woods until night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>The rebels had cut holes in all the boats, and sunk them; but the negroes were sharp, and had taken them up, repaired them and sunk them again, so all they had to do was turn the water out and they were as good as new. <pb id="p.151" n="151"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>We embarked just as night was closing in, a negro taking the paddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>The entire inhabitants followed us to the shore and knelt in prayer for our success; no cheers were given, but with hats, aprons and bandannas, they waved their farewells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>They remained until they saw us safely landed on the <rs>Georgia</rs> shore, and we felt that we had parted with dear friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>Our boatman secreted his boat and guided us to the turnpike.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>We travelled without interruption for about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. The moon was very bright, and all was quiet save the sound of our own footsteps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>We had just crossed a bridge when we heard horsemen approaching, so dropped by the roadside, under the shadow of a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>We did not dare breathe as the <num value="5">five</num> rebel cavalrymen rode past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>Renewing our journey, we soon saw a fire by the roadside, and creeping up to it saw a rebel picket on duty, his <num value="3">three</num> comrades sleeping by the fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>Thinking it dangerous to go on, we turned up a lane and found a negro, who secreted us. From him we learned that the roads were all picketed, and that the mounted patrols were constantly riding up and down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>Danger was on every hand, but we still had faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>We remained with the negro through the day, and at night started again; we could not travel in the road, as the pickets were very thick, but made our way slowly through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>Arriving at a plantation, we found the negroes much excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/><num value="1">One</num> of the girls started for the mansion, saying she was going to tell master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>We caught her and told her she must take care of us, but she would not talk, and turned back to the house, where all the colored people were gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>We followed and walked in. I was the spokesman and told our story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>They asked if we came through the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>We said we did; they could not <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> see how we got through, as <num value="10">ten</num> rebel cavalrymen were sleeping on the piazza.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>While we were talking a white woman appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>She was quite good-looking, had long, curly hair, and her dress was clean and becoming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>She said, <quote>I will take care of you;</quote> we thanked her, but said we didn't care to trust a white woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>This pleased the negroes, as she was a slave and a field-hand besides.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>The story she told us the next day was a sad <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>The overseer of the plantation was a brute, but had charge of all the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>She was employed in the house and he desired to make her his mistress, but she repelled his advances and was severely whipped; again he urged her, with no better results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>He then drove her to the swamps to work, and she was employed carrying heavy logs on her shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> of the damnable features of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>Her brother, named <persName n="Pat,,,,," id="n0168.0017.00152.00525" reg="mostcommon:Pat,nomatch:0"><surname>Pat</surname></persName>, was the driver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>(I have several times used the word <hi rend="italics">driver</hi>, and some may not understand its meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>The driver is an intelligent, faithful slave, selected by the overseer as foreman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>He turns out the slaves in the morning by blowing a horn, gives them their tasks, and has charge of them in the field.) She took us to his house, which was better than the rest, and we slept in the room with <persName n="Pat,,,,," id="n0168.0017.00152.00526" reg="mostcommon:Pat,nomatch:0"><surname>Pat</surname></persName> and his wife.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>We were awakened in the morning by the firing of cannon, and the negroes came rushing in with the news that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0168.0017.00152.00527" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> was coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>The firing grew nearer and nearer, musketry could be plainly heard, and through the cracks in the logs of the house we could see smoke where barns were burning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>The negroes grew more and more excited and reported often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/><quote>They are coming, boss, they are coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>Our hearts beat hard and fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>We were sure that night would find us safe under the old flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>We congratulated ourselves on our good judgment, talked of the foolishness of those who had tried to escape through the mountains, when our plan was so much easier, and concluded that of all the men who had escaped we were a little the smartest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>Night came on. The negroes said they would not cross the creek until after dark, and we waited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>All night these faithful negroes kept watch for us, and in the morning, with long, sad faces, reported that <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Massa</roleName> <foreName>Sherman</foreName></persName> had done gone down the river.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>We could not follow by day, but started quite early in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>We had gone but a short distance when we struck a company of cavalry camped on the roadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>We entered the swamp to flank them, but it was so dark that we lost our way, and after travelling all night, tearing our clothes and scratching our faces and hands, we came out where we entered, and again passed the day at <placeName reg="Pat's house">Pat's house</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>We were rather discouraged, and the colored people felt about as badly as we did, yet did all they could to cheer us up. Our friend, the white slave, made us gingerbread and biscuit to take with us, and said many comforting words.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>With a firm resolution to get through the lines we began our journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>It was a dark, rainy night, and we had to guess our route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>We came to a place where the road forked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/><persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> was sure he knew the road we ought to take, and I was just as confident that he was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>We scolded <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> each other for an hour, not daring to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>above a whisper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>These cat-fights occurred nearly every night, and we made up in the daytime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/><num value="1">One</num> not in our place might think it strange that we should lose our temper, but we were strained up to the highest point, and were nervous and irritable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>It was the same with nearly all who escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>I have known <num value="2">two</num> men who were fast friends who were never the same after they were recaptured, Not so with <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> and I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>He was such a dear, good fellow that he gave in to me nearly every time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>Finding we were on the wrong road we struck across the country and came upon a nice cabin near a large house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>We were listening under the window, and could hear the hum of a spinning-wheel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>As we stood there a woman opened the shutter and, as the day was just breaking, she saw us. We entered the house and found a yellow man in bed. He said, <quote>Go away from here.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>We told him who we were, but he would do nothing for us. We had our clubs, were in good fighting condition and holding them over him made him swear that he would not tell he had seen us. The woman was friendly and gave us directions how to reach the creek, but we dare not take the road, fearing the yellow fellow would forget his promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance where a man with a drop of negro blood in his veins had refused to help us. We turned into the woods, but they were so thin that we were forced to cut down small pine trees and stick them in the ground where we lay down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>It was so cold we could not sleep, and as we dare not travel through this open country, we kept alive by rolling over and over on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>Besides being cold we suffered for food, as we had eaten nothing since the previous day. We <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> could endure it no longer, and late in the afternoon resumed our tramp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>Calling at a cabin, a negro baked the last morsel of meal he had in the house for us, and after we had eaten it, directed us to the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>Here we found a new trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/><orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0168.0017.00155.00530" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> had burned the bridge, and we had <quote><num value="1">one</num> wide river to cross.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>We made a raft out of pieces of plank, and went over all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/><persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> was on the forward end of the raft; as we reached the opposite bank he caught a grape-vine and swung himself on shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>He left the raft and so did I, the only difference being that he was safe on land while I went into the water and came up under the raft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>He fished me out, and with my clothes nearly frozen on me we continued our journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>Arriving at an old mill we called up the miller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>He let us in, but was afraid to keep us, as the rebel pickets were very near, and liable to come there at any time, so we must keep in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>I was too wet to lie down, so we ran along in the edge of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>We saw places where <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0168.0017.00155.00531" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had camped only the day before, and the fires were still smoking.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>As we were running along we saw a negro coming towards us on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>Driven by hunger, we hailed him and asked for food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>He said he was going to mill, but would return in about an hour and would take us to a place where he could feed us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>We waited until he returned, when he told us to keep him in sight and follow along in the woods; we had gone only a short distance when he began to whoop and put his horse into a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>What was up we could not make out until, looking towards a shanty, we saw a rebel soldier walking towards us on crutches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>He came near and said, <quote>Come out, boys, <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> and have a talk.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>We looked at each other, then at the <rs>Johnnie Reb</rs>. There were <num value="2">two</num> of us with <num value="2">two</num> clubs, and, so far as we could see, only <num value="1">one</num> rebel, and he a cripple; so we came out. The negro came riding back, and we asked him what it meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>He looked frightened, but said, <quote>I know this man; his father raised me. He fought, but he never wanted to fought.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>The rebel said it was not safe to stay there, but designated a place where he could meet us; he mounted the horse behind the negro, and we went through the woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>Arriving at the place designated, we saw our <persName><foreName>Johnnie</foreName></persName> jumping and coming all sorts of gymnastic performances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>We demanded an explanation; he said, <quote>I am as sound a man as there is in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>I was slightly wounded at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, and was sent to guard your boys at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>I saw them starved to death and swore that if ever I could help <num value="1">one</num> get away I would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>Now is my chance, and I'll be dog-goned if I don't do it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>He was a typical rebel in every respect, a regular <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6199" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName> cracker; hair long, high cheek bones, tall and slim, but he talked well and appeared earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>After the negro had turned out the horse he came to us and he and the rebel talked over the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>The trouble was what to do with us now we were with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/><persName><foreName>Johnnie</foreName></persName> suggested taking us home; the negro said it would not do, as his wife's sister would betray us; but <persName n="Enos,,,,," id="n0168.0017.00156.00532" reg="mostcommon:Enos,nomatch:0"><surname>Enos</surname></persName> (his name was <persName n="Sapp,,Enos,,," id="n0168.0017.00156.00533" reg="default:Sapp,Enos,,,"><foreName>Enos</foreName> <surname>Sapp</surname></persName>) said the <rs>Yankees</rs> had her husband a prisoner and he reckoned she would be mighty glad if some <num value="1">one</num> would help him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>Being in his hands, we could do nothing but go <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>He said if the war lasted <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> he should use them until the end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>He introduced us to the women as <num value="2">two</num> friends of his. They sat in the corner of the fire-place smoking corn-cob pipes, and said very little to us, not because they were displeased but because it would require an effort to talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>We made ourselves at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/><num value="1">One</num> of the women asked me if I would have a smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>As I had little chance to indulge in my favorite habit I gladly accepted her offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2158"/>She took the pipe out of her mouth and handed it to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>They didn't seem to know or care what army we belonged to. Supper was announced and we went outside to the other house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2160"/>I suppose this was the dining hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2161"/>The table was set, but there was not a whole plate on it or <num value="2">two</num> pieces alike.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>Our host was a religious man and asked a blessing at the table, but he had a hard time carving the pork and remarked that it was tough as h--. After the vesper meal we returned to the mansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>The pipes were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing, and as they all wanted to smoke, they fixed up a new <num value="1">one</num> for me. <persName n="Enos,,,,," id="n0168.0017.00157.00537" reg="mostcommon:Enos,nomatch:0"><surname>Enos</surname></persName> then told them who we were, and we saw indications of fear on their faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2165"/>The sister, whose husband was in a Yankee <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> prison, asked if we knew Sam. We could not recall him, but without doubt had met him, and assured her that wherever <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> was, if in a Union prison he had enough to eat; a good bed and all the comforts of life, more than he would have at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2166"/>They questioned us about our <name>Yankee</name> women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2167"/>They said they had heard that they wore good clothes and had jewelry; we told them they had been rightly informed, and they said, <quote>Why, you all have no slaves; where do they get them?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2168"/>Our answer was that our women worked.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>About <num value="4">four</num> in the afternoon we sat up in the husks, ate the last of the cornbread the negro had given us, then covered ourselves over to wait for darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>While we were hidden from view we did not entirely cover our haversack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>In a short time we heard voices, and a man said, <quote>There is a haversack: I am going to get it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2202"/>As he walked over the husks he stepped on me, but I did not squeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>As he picked up the haversack, he saw <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName>'s arm and cried, <quote>The barn is full of d-d <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>We heard the click as they cocked their pieces, and thinking it about time to stop further proceedings, we lifted up our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/><quote>Throw down your arms,</quote> was the next order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>We explained that we had performed that sad duty several months before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>After much talk they let us come out. Our captors were <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> rangers, the hardest looking set of men I ever met; dressed more like cowboys than soldiers, armed with sabres, <num value="2">two</num> revolvers each, carbines, besides a lariat hung to the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>There were but <num value="3">three</num> of them, and we resolved to make an appeal for <num value="1">one</num> more chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>In the most earnest manner possible we told the story of our long service in the field, our starvation in prison, our long tramp for liberty and our near approach to our lines, and begged them to let us go. I think we made an impression on them, but after <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> conferring they said, <quote>You are loyal to your side and we must be to ours, but we will use you well while we have you in charge.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>The rest of the company came up while we were talking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>They had <measure n="36" type="prisoners">thirty-six prisoners</measure>, captured from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00162.00543" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>These were known as <quote><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00162.00544" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s bummers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>My experience with the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> had been such that I looked with little favor on the bummers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>Had they been with their comrades they would not have been captured, but they were, like a large part of that army, scattered over the country, not foraging for the army but for themselves, and the loyal negro was <quote>cleaned out</quote> the same as the <quote>reb.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>It was demoralizing, and had the rebels been in force on this flank or rear, disasters instead of success would have overtaken that grand army before it reached the sea. With the bummers we were turned into the corn and slept in the husks that night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>Bright and early the next morning we were turned out and were soon on our way back to <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>The old negro came to see us off; as his eyes fell on <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> and me a look of sadness came over his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>Our guards were well mounted and they made us <quote>hiper.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>We marched several miles without a halt, when we came to a brook, where all were given a chance to quench our thirst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>As we had no cups we lay down and drank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/><num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the boys got up and started on, I alone remaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>I was sure that the guards were gone and was ready to run for the woods, when, looking over my shoulder, I saw <num value="1">one</num> with his revolver pointed at my head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/><quote>Oh, no!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>I replied.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>We halted at night in a grove near a large mansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>We were hungry and footsore, having eaten nothing that day, and having marched <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>. The <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant Commanding">lieutenant commanding</rs> the guard went to the house and demanded supper for <num value="70">seventy</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>After declaring over and over again that he had nothing, the officer said, <quote>we will see,</quote> and sent a sergeant and some men into the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>The old man changed his tune a little, said he would try to find something, and after a short time brought out a bag of meal, some sweet potatoes and a side of bacon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>All shared alike, the prisoners receiving the same as the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>The night was as cold as any <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> night in the north, and the guard drew on the old man for a good supply of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>Unlike our army, they did not go after it but ordered it brought to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>They built several large fires, and then posted guards for the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>We were in a small space and there were only <num value="7">seven</num> men on posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>I believed there was a chance to make a break if we could only make the men understand it. <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> and I formed our plans and began to work them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>I had lain down by the side of <measure n="2" type="prisoners">two prisoners</measure> and got them interested, then stood up, warmed myself, and was sauntering over to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, when <num value="1">one</num> of the guards cocked his piece, and said, <quote><persName n="Yank,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00163.00546" reg="mostcommon:Yank,nomatch:0"><surname>Yank</surname></persName>, you get up on that stump; I don't like to see you moving about so much.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>I tried to explain that I was so cold that I could not sleep and must move to keep warm, but he replied, <quote>I think I shall feel better to see you on that <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> stump.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>So I took the stump and held it until daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>Another draft was made upon the old man for breakfast, and we continued the march.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>The citizens along the route were very bitter, and at times the guards had hard work to protect us. Women came out with revolvers, looking for the <name>Yanks</name> who had broken open their trunks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>Although our guards were very kind to us they did not take so kindly to <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00164.00547" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s men. While in a ravine they halted us, and proposed to strip us. <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> and I protested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>They said, <quote>These men have robbed our people and ought to be punished.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>We told them they would get enough when they arrived at the prison, and that it was too cheap business for gentlemen, as they had proved themselves to be. This aroused their pride, and they let the boys march on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>At <placeName reg="Waynesboro, Burke, Georgia" key="tgn,2024678">Waynesboro</placeName> the citizens were determined to kill us. <num value="1">One</num> old man struck a boy over the head with a hickory cane, breaking the cane in <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>It looked as though we should have a hard time, but the guards stood by us, and declared they would shoot the next <num value="1">one</num> who struck us. The women were worse than the men, and could hardly keep from scratching our eyes out. All were going to die in the last ditch, live in the mountains, walk to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, or do anything except live in the same country with <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>We were called every name that was bad. <num value="1">One</num> woman said the <rs>Yankees</rs> were so mean that when they went through the town they stole a woman's false teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>It was suggested that if she had kept her mouth shut they would not have known she had false teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>The guards laughed, and the woman jumped up and down, mad way through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>She was about as angry with the guards as with us. <pb id="p.165" n="165"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>We took cars here for <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>; the <rs>Texans</rs> said Georgians were mighty mean people, and they reckoned we had better get to <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> before we had trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>We arrived at <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> late in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>The people expected us and were in line on each side of the street to welcome us. Old men called us <quote>Yankee-doodles;</quote> boys called us <quote>Blue bellies;</quote> the women yelled all sorts of vile words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>We marched up the main street into an old stock yard; an officer, dressed in the uniform of a captain of our army, stood at the gate, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> words we heard were, <quote>Halt, d-n you, halt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>Would you go to h--<num value="11">11</num> in a moment?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>Our <placeName key="tgn,7007826" n="1.000 4446" reg="texas">Texas</placeName> guards left us here; they shook hands with <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> and me, wished us good luck, but reckoned we would have a right hard time with this fellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>The <quote>imp of darkness</quote> who commanded the place was a Tennesseean, named <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00165.00548" reg="mostcommon:Moore,nomatch:0"><surname>Moore</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>He was surrounded by a gang of cut-throats, mostly deserters from our army, who, having jumped all the bounties possible, had joined his gang; nearly all were dressed in uniforms of blue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>We were turned into a mule pen, and while resting there a boy about <measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure> old, dressed in rebel gray, came to me and said, <quote>They are going to search you; if you have anything you want to save, give it to me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/><quote>But you are a rebel,</quote> I said, <quote>and I can't trust you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>He answered that he was not, only galvanized (had taken the oath); that he had been a prisoner at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> and had not courage to hold out, so he had gone over to the other side, but assured me that if I would trust him he would be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>While I hated the sight of him for his treason, he was better than the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>All I had was my diary; it was very imperfect and of no real value; but in it I had noted the places where we had stopped <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> while out, and I felt if <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00166.00549" reg="mostcommon:Moore,nomatch:0"><surname>Moore</surname></persName> got it the negroes who had assisted us would suffer, so I gave it to him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>Looking at me he said, <quote>I swear you look like the breaking up of a hard winter.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>He drew us into line and the picking began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/><persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> had a corps badge that he had made while at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>; it was cut out of bone, and was the work of days, but it had to go. As the <name>Tennesseean</name> came to me he said, <quote>That cuss isn't worth picking,</quote> and passed me by. From the men they took everything; pictures of friends at home, and when it was a picture of a lady, coarse remarks would be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>After all the articles had been taken from their pockets, the order was given to take off pants, blouses and shoes, and when we were turned back into the pen they were nearly naked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>The pen was very filthy; the mules had recently vacated, and it had not been cleaned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/><persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00166.00551" reg="mostcommon:Moore,nomatch:0"><surname>Moore</surname></persName> said, <quote>Make yourselves as miserable as possible, and I hope to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> not <num value="1">one</num> of you will be alive in the morning.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>Gangs of the roughs came in and tried to trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/><num value="1">One</num> of the boys came to me, saying, <quote>I have a watch that they did not find; <num value="1">one</num> of these men says he will give <num value="4">four</num> blankets for a watch, and I think I had better let him have it, as we shall freeze to death here.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>I assured him that he would lose his watch and get no blankets, but he was so cold he could not resist the temptation, and gave the fellow the watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>When he came in again he asked for the blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>The wretch knocked him down and kicked him; that was all he received for the watch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>My galvanized friend turned up again and said they were coming after my jacket,--that they wanted the buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>I took it off and laid it under another man. Soon they came <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> in and asked for the officer with the jacket, a friend outside wanted to talk with him. They shook me and asked where he was. I replied, <quote>He lay down over the other side.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>They carried pitch-pine torches and looked at every man, but failed to find the jacket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>We managed to live through the night, and in the morning my boy returned the diary, and <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName>, <num value="2">two</num> other officers who had been recaptured, and myself were taken out to be sent to <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>As we passed out I heard <num value="1">one</num> of the gang say, <quote>There is the cuss with the jacket,</quote> but he did not take it, and we marched to the depot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>The rebels must have entertained an idea that <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> could live without food, for they issued no rations to us either at night or in the morning, and we were hungry enough to eat a raw dog. Our train was <num value="1">one</num> of those southern tri-weeklies which went from <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> to <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> week and tried to get back the next, and stopped at every crossroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>At <num value="1">one</num> place an old negro woman was selling sweet potato pies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>I had a <persName n="Byam,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00167.00552" reg="mostcommon:Byam,nomatch:0"><surname>Byam</surname></persName>'s match paper and bought <num value="1">one</num> with it. She asked, <quote>Is it good, boss?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>I replied that it was worth <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> in Confederate, and she was satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>I think she got the best of it, for the thing she sold me for a pie was a worse imitation of that article than the match paper was of Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>At another place I bought a <num value="2">two</num>-quart pail <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> full of ham fat, paying for it with <num value="1">one</num> of the <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollar</measure> bills <persName n="Packard,,,,," id="n0168.0018.00167.00553" reg="mostcommon:Packard,L.,H.,,:1"><surname>Packard</surname></persName> gave us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>We spent the entire day on the road, arriving at <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> at <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> in the evening, and were put in jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>We were not confined in a cell, but in a small room with a fireplace; we found a fire burning on the health, and went to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>As we had had no opportunity to examine our <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> clothes since we escaped, their condition can be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>We took bricks out of the hearth and spent an hour reducing the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>It sounded like the discharge of musketry, and the list of killed was larger than in any battle of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>In the morning we were ordered out and marched through the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>We learned that <placeName reg="Camp Sorghum">Camp Sorghum</placeName> had been broken up and our officers moved to the lunatic asylum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>The gate of the new prison swung open, the crowd gathered, expecting to see <quote>fresh fish,</quote> but instead saw <num value="4">four</num> ragged, dirty, old tramps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>We were received with a grand hurrah, and they gathered around to hear our story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>We had been out just <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure>, and had travelled more than <measure n="300miles" type="distance">three hundred miles</measure>. While we were much disappointed we were not discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>Our trip had done us good; we had gained in flesh, had thrown off the stagnation of prison life and were ready to try again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>We were assigned to squad <num value="15">fifteen</num>, composed of men who had escaped, and we were a fine collection of innocents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>Before we escaped from <placeName reg="Camp Sorghum">Camp Sorghum</placeName> an order had been issued by the rebel commander that if any more escaped they would put us in a pen, and the removal to <placeName reg="Asylum Prison">Asylum Prison</placeName> was the result.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>There were about <measure n="2acres" type="area">two acres</measure> enclosed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>On <num value="3">three</num> sides were brick walks; on the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> a high board fence which separated us from the insane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>The flames of about <num value="30">thirty</num> small buildings were <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> up and <num value="11">eleven</num> were covered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>The work had been done by our officers, and the rebels promised to send in lumber to cover the rest, but it never came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>The <num value="11">eleven</num> would accommodate about <num value="300">three hundred</num>, the rest being quartered in a few old tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>Our squad had neither buildings nor tents, and we huddled together on the bare ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>It was so cold that we walked most of the night to keep from freezing.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>I received <num value="8">eight</num> letters upon my return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>They had been written at various times, but all came in <num value="1">one</num> mail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/><persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> was taken sick and sent to the hospital.
