<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>much was said in <placeName>France</placeName> about the <rs>American</rs> civil war while it lasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>But the documents necessary to a full understanding of it as a whole, and to follow it in its details, were then wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Since that time public attention has been diverted by the events which have occurred in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Nevertheless, this war in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> may be useful to study, even after those of which our continent was the theatre in <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>At a time when labor and contemplation are the duty of all, no page of contemporaneous military history should be neglected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Having been kindly received in the armies of the republic, which remembers the support given by <placeName>France</placeName> to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> defenders of its independence, and has not failed to place the name of <persName n="Bourbon,,,,," id="n0321.0001.00000.00003" reg="mostcommon:Bourbon,nomatch:0"><surname>Bourbon</surname></persName> among those who are to perpetuate its memory on its soil, it has been the wish of the author to present his grateful testimony to his late companions in arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>In writing his personal recollections, lie has been led to describe a war some incidents of which lave cone within his own personal observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Notwithstanding his legitimate preferences for the cause he served, he has endeavored to preserve, throughout his narrative, the strictest impartiality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>He has examined, with equal care, the documents that have emanated from both parties; and if his work be a reflex of the vicissitudes in the midst of which it was prosecuted, he believes that it possesses, at least, the merit of precision and sincerity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>gentlemen: The necessities of an early publication of the translation of my History of the <rs>Civil War</rs> in <placeName>America</placeName> having prevented me from revising that translation before the present issue, I must leave upon <persName n="Tasistro,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0001.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Tasistro,L.,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tasistro</surname></persName> the responsibility of his work; but his ability is a sufficient guarantee that this work has been accomplished with care and accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It has therefore been agreed between my publishers, <persName n="Levy,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0001.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Levy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Levy</surname></persName>, and myself to grant to the translation, since it is to be published by yourselves, the exclusive copyright in <placeName>England</placeName>, according to the forms prescribed by international treaties, and, in <placeName>America</placeName>, the right of giving out your edition as the only <num value="1">one</num> authorized by myself:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>My History has been written rather for the instruction of the <rs>European</rs> public than for Transatlantic readers, to whom every incident of the war is already familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I trust that my account of these great events will, at least, not provoke a too bitter controversy; for if I have been obliged to judge and to censure, I have done so without any personal or partial fueling against any <num value="1">one</num>, with a sincere respect for truth and a keen sense of the responsibility which I assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I hope, moreover, that your readers will acknowledge that I have tried to make <placeName>Europe</placeName> understand the magnitude of the strife which divided the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>, the extent of the sacrifices borne by the <rs>American</rs> people, and the heroism displayed by both sides on the bloody fields of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I should be proud to have my share in raising the monument which is to perpetuate the memory of that heroism and the glory of the <rs>American</rs> soldier, without distinction between the blue and the gray coats.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> 
<text><body> 
<p>when I was called by the publisher to the task of editing this work, I was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> doubtful as to the extent and limit of my labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The <name>English</name> version of <persName n="Tasistro,Mister,L.,F.,," id="n0321.0002.00000.00009" reg="default:Tasistro,L.,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Tasistro</surname></persName>, an experienced translator, had already been made, and was placed in my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>After a very careful revision of it, particularly as to military details and technicalities, with which my former life had rendered me more familiar, I found myself really limited to seeing the volume properly through the press, with scarcely a comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The very few editorial notes are upon points of fact or statistics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It would have been unbecoming in me to argue upon controverted questions, national, political, or military, upon which, after careful investigation and mature deliberation, the author has expressed himself decidedly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Least of all have I considered it within my province to say a word as to his estimates of individuals and their relations to the government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He has himself said that his history was written for <placeName>European</placeName> readers, who desire to know only his impressions and conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But the book will be largely read in this country by people more capable of judging its facts and its philosophy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This I may be permitted to say: He has produced a book displaying careful research, cool judgment, and a manifest purpose to be just to all. It is vigorous in style, scholarly without a touch of pedantry; his battle-pictures are effective from their great simplicity; the battle fights itself under the reader's eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>So varied and skilful is the handling of the narrative that the <pb n="vi"/> interest does not flag for a moment, even when he deals with dry statistics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In a large and philosophic view of American institutions he has rivalled <persName n="Tocqueville,,De,,," id="n0321.0002.00000.00010" reg="default:Tocqueville,De,,,"><foreName>De</foreName> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Although his service was short in this country, he gained a full knowledge of the machinery and working of our government, and was a witness of the marvellous creation of a colossal army out of nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He has thus been enabled to use intelligently the large materials he has collected, and to present the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> portion of what must be regarded as an admirable history of the greatest war, as to numbers, extent of territory, and importance of issue, the world has ever seen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> word has been altered or omitted from the original; the only change is in form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>To bring it more readily within the scope of all who desire to read it, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> <name>French</name> volumes have been compressed into <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>American</rs> edition, and a similar arrangement will be adopted for the following volumes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The maps necessary to a clear understanding of the text have been exactly reproduced; only the general maps of large sections of country have been omitted, as they may be supplied by any good American atlas within the reader's reach.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <name>French</name> metrical system of measurement has been retained in the translation, because it is already greatly used in this country and taught in our schools, and because, although on a scale the transfer is easy from miles to kilometres, etc., it is difficult to make the transfer in decimals throughout the text.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>For convenience the reader is reminded that a <hi rend="italics">metre</hi>= <num value="39.38">39.38</num> American inches; a <hi rend="italics">centimetre</hi>, the <num value="100" type="ordinal">one hundredth</num> of a metre, = .<num value="3938">3938</num> of an inch; <hi rend="italics">kilometer</hi>=.<num value="62">62</num> of a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It may further be observed that as the map scales are simply fractions of any unit, as <num value="60000">60,000</num> to <num value="1">1</num>, etc., distances may be laid off at once in our measures by assuming our unit. </p><closer><signed>H.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>A <hi rend="italics">coup daetat</hi> was attempted against the <rs>Constitution</rs> of that republic by the powerful oligarchy which ruled in the <rs>South</rs> and had long controlled in the councils of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>On the day when the common law, which guarantees alike to the poor and the outcast respect for their individual rights, and to the majority the full enjoyment of political power, is violated by any portion of the community, if the outrage be not severely repressed, despotism is established in the land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Beaten in the presidential elections of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Southern States</rs> sought to regain by intimidation or force the influence they had exercised until then in the interest of slavery; and while shouting aloud the words <q direct="unspecified">Independence and liberty,</q> they trampled the solemn contract under foot as soon as the national ballot had declared against their policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But success, that great apologist of predestinarians, failed them, and victory favored the cause of right and loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Then it was seen what treasures of energy the free and constant practice of liberty hoards up for a people fortunate enough to possess it and sufficiently wise to guard it. <pb id="p.2" n="2"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> had already solved <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult problems of our age by developing free institutions in the midst of a democratic society; but no great internal crisis had yet arisen to try their solidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Many people had asserted that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> storm would wrench this fragile plant from a soil that could not afford it sustenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The storm-wind of civil war arose, and, contrary to these predictions, the vigorous tree of American institutions, spreading its shadow over the country where it had taken such deep root, saved it from impending destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>In this crisis, the <rs>American</rs> people learned to appreciate their Constitution even more than they had done in the past; and they proved to the world that the statue of Liberty is not a worthless idol, deaf in the hour of danger, but the holy symbol of a powerful divinity which may be invoked in seasons of adversity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Therefore, although war always presents a cruel aspect, we may, at least, examine the <num value="1">one</num> that has lately rent <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> without experiencing that profound and unmitigated sadness which the triumphs of violence and injustice inspire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It is interesting to observe how that victory, so long disputed, the results of which are patent to every observer, although the causes are difficult to unravel from a distance, was achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In this study, as important to the soldier as to the statesman, we should doubtless take into consideration the difference of institutions, customs, and many peculiar circumstances; but on the other hand, we should not reject without examination precious examples and dearly bought experiences, under the pretext that what has succeeded in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> cannot be applied to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The work we have undertaken is essentially a military history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We shall not, therefore, attempt to describe the constitutional struggles and the political events which brought on the war, a narrative of which we present in these pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But at a time when the misfortunes of our own country impart a peculiar importance to all questions of military organization, we have thought this narrative would appear incomplete if we did not begin by placing before the reader a somewhat detailed account of the resources of the <num value="2">two</num> adversaries, how they made use of them, the services rendered to both parties by a corps of regular army officers, well trained and brought up under the influence of excellent traditions, <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> and finally the improvisation of the large armies which sustained that long war. This preliminary exposition will show how those armies, finding themselves on both sides in an analogous condition, were able to organize and gradually acquire a military character, without being exposed to the disasters which both would have experienced if from the commencement they had had to fight with veteran and disciplined troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We must, therefore, in the first place, show in a rapid sketch what the <rs>American</rs> army was previous to <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Although the <rs>Americans</rs> were not a military people, they had had occasion to exhibit certain warlike qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>During their short history they already had precedents for the organization of their national forces, and a small knot of brave and devoted men had preserved from oblivion the traditions acquired in campaigns instructive if not brilliant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Without dwelling at length on the wars in which the <rs>American</rs> soldier figured prior to <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, it is necessary that we should say a few words on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The reader will the better understand the remarkable movement which called large armies into existence at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rumor of civil war, when he has seen how volunteer corps were formed at other epochs in the history of the young republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>After having followed the small regular army to the far <rs>West</rs> and to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> the part it played in the great military organization of the <rs>Federals</rs> and the <rs>Confederates</rs> will be understood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It was against our soldiers in the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War that the <rs>American</rs> volunteers, then composing the militia of an English colony, made their <hi rend="italics">debut</hi> in arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>This fact may be recalled to mind not only without bitterness, since, Heaven be praised!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>the flag of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, since it has been afloat, has never been found opposed to that of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> on the field of battle, but also as a remembrance constituting an additional tie between them and us. For, during the unequal struggle which decided the ownership of the new continent, those militia-men received some useful lessons while contending with the handful of heroic men who defended our empire beyond the seas in spite of a forgetful country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The soldiers of the war of independence were formed in that <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/><persName n="Montcalm,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00004.00011" reg="mostcommon:Montcalm,nomatch:0"><surname>Montcalm</surname></persName>, even more than <persName n="Wolfe,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00004.00012" reg="mostcommon:Wolfe,nomatch:0"><surname>Wolfe</surname></persName>, was the instructor of those adversaries who very soon undertook to avenge him. It was while endeavoring to supplant the <rs>French</rs> on the borders of the <rs>Ohio</rs>, by long and frequently disastrous expeditions, that the founder of the <rs>American</rs> nation gave the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> indications of that indefatigable energy which in the end triumphed over every obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It was the example of the defenders of <placeName reg="Fort Carillon">Fort Carillon</placeName>, in holding an English army in check from behind a miserable breastwork, which inspired at a later period the combatants of <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It was the surrender of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> at <placeName key="tgn,2042800" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Necessity, Franklin, Louisiana">Fort Necessity</placeName>, and the disaster of <placeName reg="Braddock Hills, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086603">Braddock</placeName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013927" n="1.000 10" reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania">Fort Duquesne</placeName>, which taught the future conquerors of <placeName reg="Schuylerville, Saratoga, New York" key="tgn,7014490">Saratoga</placeName> how, in those wild countries, to embarrass the march of an enemy, to cut off his supplies, to neutralize his advantages, until, at last, he was either captured or annihilated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>So that, although at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> despised in the aristocratic ranks of the regular <name>English</name> army, the <hi rend="italics">provincial militia</hi>, as they were then called, soon learned how to make themselves appreciated, and to compel respect from their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>In that war, so different from those waged in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in those conflicts carried on in the midst of a wild and wooded country, they already displayed all the qualities which have since characterized the <rs>American</rs>&mdash;shrewdness, strength, valor, and personal intelligence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>These qualities were again displayed when, <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> later, they took up arms once more, under the name of <hi rend="italics">volunteers</hi> or <hi rend="italics">national militia</hi>, in order to shake off the oppressive yoke of the mother-country; but they had no longer the intelligent officers of the <rs>English</rs> army to direct them, nor the old regular forces to support them at the critical moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Their <hi rend="italics">role</hi> of auxiliaries had but poorly prepared them to sustain alone the great struggle which patriotism imposed upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Beside <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> no colonial officer had ever figured in a high rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Consequently, the <rs>French</rs> who came with <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Lafayette</placeName> to place their experience at the service of the young American army brought to the latter most valuable assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But their best ally, their greatest strength, was that perseverance which enabled them to turn a defeat to advantage instead of succumbing under it. This was demonstrated when the arrival of <persName n="Rochambeau,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00004.00013" reg="mostcommon:Rochambeau,nomatch:0"><surname>Rochambeau</surname></persName> furnished them the opportunity to undertake that splendid and decisive campaign <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> which transferred the war from the borders of the <rs>Hudson</rs> into <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and ended it by <num value="1">one</num> blow in the trenches of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The late events which have steeped the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in blood impart a peculiar interest to the study of the war of American independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The theatre is the same, the character of the country has changed but little since then, and on both sides the actors are the descendants of the soldiers of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>In that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempt of the young American nation to organize its military power we shall find precedents for what was done in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and in the meagre armies of the last century the model of those which, in our own day, have participated in the civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But we must, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, point out certain important differences which mark both wars, and the circumstances under which they were undertaken; in fact, it is in consequence of not having taken notice of these differences that many people have found their predictions falsified by the results of the late struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Because the <num value="13">thirteen</num> colonies had exhausted the efforts of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, they believed that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> would eventually wear out the strength of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Fortunately, the comparison between the generous movement of <dateStruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct> and the resort to arms by the slave-owners in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> is as false in a military as in a political point of view.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>On the day when the colonies shook off the authority of the mother-country, all the strategic points of their territory were occupied by the <rs>English</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It was necessary, therefore, to conquer everything: they had nothing to lose, and could not have considered themselves as beaten, even though the enemy was still in the heart of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>In <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, on the contrary, the <rs>Confederates</rs>, masters of all the territory which they sought to alienate from the lawful jurisdiction of the new <rs>President</rs>, had need of all that vast country, partly for the maintenance of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, and partly for the support of their numerous armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It is true that in cases of extreme urgency, the number of men required for the militia could be raised by general draft, as in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>But this experiment had once been tried in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and had caused so much trouble that it was found necessary to abandon it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>As the distress of the country contributed to the general embarrassment, the difficulties which it had been sought to avoid very soon reappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>In order to encourage re-enlistments, the pay was raised, money-bounties were offered on being mustered into service, and land-bounties on being mustered out. <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> pointed out in vain the inconveniences of a system which mingled speculation with the noble and rugged profession of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The result was that the allurements of the new bounties induced the volunteers to seek opportunities to re-enlist by shortening their time of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>This question of grammar almost caused the shedding of blood; it was deemed expedient to yield to the demands of the volunteers, and their interpretation was finally adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Nor did unjust rivalries and petty jealousies spare the most illustrious soldiers of the war of independence; but these belong to all times and to all countries, and the <rs>Americans</rs> did not wait long to indemnify those who had been their victims by a spontaneous reaction in public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Yet, between this period, which may be called its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resurrection, and the day when it was definitely organized, the regular army experienced a great many vicissitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Knowing from experience the inconvenience of an improvised army, he thought of endowing his country with military institutions, and of preparing a few <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi>,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>When war was imminent, it was immediately swelled by adding to it, for want of established <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi>, regiments entirely new, in which all the grades were conferred at random; and when peaceful tendencies were again in the ascendant, both officers and men were hastily discharged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>In <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct> this army comprised only <num value="1">one</num> regiment of infantry and <num value="1">one</num> battalion of artillery&mdash;<num value="1216">twelve hundred and sixteen</num> men in all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>But it frequently happened that, by this process, officers were procured more readily than soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Thus, in <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct>, apprehending a war with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, Congress ordered a levy of <num value="13000">thirteen thousand</num> regular troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Consequently, the more <rs>America</rs> relied upon her volunteers for defence, the more she needed a permanent school to form a corps of educated officers, possessing traditions and a military spirit, and capable of supplying the wants of an improvised and inexperienced army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had felt this need, and desired to found a Federal school, upon a sufficiently comprehensive basis, in order that it might render this important service to the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>We shall not pause to narrate the particulars of that war, for it has left no important traditions behind, and only developed a small number of distinguished men. It presents but few instructive examples of the mode of fighting in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>, and with the exception of the brilliant affair of New Orleans, it scarcely displayed aught save the ordinary defects of American volunteers, without bringing their best qualities into relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The campaigns in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, if such a term may be applied to a series of disjointed operations as insignificant in their results as in the means employed, are utterly destitute of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The regular army was hardly in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The volunteers, few in number, levied in haste, and generally for the term of a single expedition, confined to the frontier of their own State, could scarcely be considered as part of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The militia, more insubordinate still than under <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00013.00022" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, found constitutional reasons for refusing, even in the midst of active operations, to go beyond the frontier to support their comrades in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The most bloody affair, perhaps &mdash;that of <placeName reg="Niagara, New York, United States" key="tgn,1002718">Niagara</placeName>&mdash;was a night skirmish, in which each of the contending parties, believing itself beaten, abandoned the field of battle before the break of day; while the rout of <placeName key="tgn,2046277" n="1.000 14" reg="bladensburg, prince georges, maryland">Bladensburg</placeName> <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> threw a melancholy light upon the demoralization of those improvised troops.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Those, however, who followed that war throughout all its chequered fortunes, might already have noticed <num value="1">one</num> fact&mdash;a fact which has often been confirmed since&mdash;that on the soil of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> the defensive is easy, but the offensive difficult, to maintain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Absorbed by their struggle with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the <rs>British</rs>, instead of attacking, were obliged to wait for the <rs>Americans</rs> in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>; this necessity constituted their strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>In <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, peace with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, by restoring to them all freedom of action, seemed to have given them a guaranty of indisputable superiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The reverse took place; for feeling themselves the stronger, they resumed the offensive, and the <rs>Americans</rs>, being attacked in their turn, soon recovered all the advantages they had lost by invading the territory of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>In fact, after having been successful at <placeName key="tgn,2046277" n="1.000 14" reg="bladensburg, prince georges, maryland">Bladensburg</placeName> without effort, having burnt <num value="1">one</num> portion of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and occupied the rest, the <rs>British</rs> could not sustain themselves in that position; and in vacating the capital of the enemy without a fight, they were obliged to acknowledge how fruitless was the victory which had delivered it to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>At last, the war ended to the advantage of the <rs>Americans</rs> on the borders of <placeName reg="Lake Champlain, North and Central America" key="tgn,7024078">Lake Champlain</placeName> and at New Orleans, where the <rs>British</rs> were vanquished by a handful of white men and negroes mixed together and armed in haste, to whom <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00014.00025" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had imparted his own indomitable energy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>These <num value="2">two</num> fortunate affairs could not make <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> forget the events that had preceded them, and had proved a serious lesson to her. Therefore this war was not altogether useless to her, for it made her feel the necessity of reorganizing her military institutions upon a new basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>From the very beginning, public opinion, that all-powerful judge among free peoples, which possesses perhaps the caprices, but not the fatal infatuations, of despots, had promptly recovered from all its prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>It was then that the project of a military school, bequeathed by <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00014.00026" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> was adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>They formed the effective total of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops on the peace footing, which it was finally determined to organize in a more definite manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>It is, therefore, from that year that the existence, in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, of a regular army may be dated, comprising corps of all arms, systematically recruited, having a fixed system of promotion, and opening a legitimate career to officers, certain, henceforth, of retaining their respective grades. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/><emph>A</emph> regular standing army, with its discipline and successive grades, placed in the midst of a society so fluctuating and so jealous of everything which does not emanate directly from the elective power, must have occupied a singular and difficult position.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>We must enter into some details concerning its organization, which had changed but little since its creation, and which served as a model to that of the volunteer army, whose campaigns we shall have to narrate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The <orgName n="West Point Academy" type="academy">West Point Academy</orgName> has exercised a powerful influence upon the character of the <rs>American</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Situated on the wooded banks of the <placeName reg="Little Choptank River, Dorchester, Maryland" key="tgn,2453427">Hudson</placeName>, upon a picturesque site, where interesting historical associations cluster around an important military post, the cradle of the family of <hi rend="italics">regulars</hi> is in striking contrast with all its surroundings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>At the foot of that peaceful retreat, where military traditions are religiously cherished, the great river which waters New York presents a moving panorama of active industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>By a remarkable exception in that country of perpetual changes, the academy, from its foundation to the period of which we speak, has preserved its early regulations and statutes, and the pupils still wear the gray coat with narrow black lace on the facings which was adopted for the use of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Eng">first engineer</orgName>-cadets in <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The system of admission is also in contrast with the equalizing customs of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>It is founded entirely upon favor, and it is only since the war that a <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> proposition has been made, hitherto without success, to open the places to competition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>This anomaly, however, is susceptible of explanation; for the profession of arms was but little courted, and besides, the <rs>American</rs> people do not consider government offices as public property, for a share in the distribution of which every <num value="1">one</num> has a right to bid, undergoing an examination as to fitness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The system of filling up vacancies in the academy adopted by its founders was devised with a view of making that institution as perfect a representation as possible of the confederation of States of which it was the common bond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/><num value="10">Ten</num> pupils are appointed every year at large by the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Moreover, each of the electoral districts which send members to the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> designates every <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, through the agency of that member, <num value="1">one</num> pupil, who is admitted after an examination which is purely nominal.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>These selections have frequently been the result of good luck rather than of good judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>As an illustration of these fortunate chances we may quote the case of the young <persName n="Kilpatrick,General,,,," id="n0321.0003.00017.00028" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">general</roleName> <surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant cavalry officers in the late war, who was indebted to his precocious eloquence for his admission to <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>In <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, when only <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age, he was extremely anxious to embrace the profession of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The right to nominate a pupil to <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName> was about to fall upon the <rs>Representative</rs> of his district, and, on the other hand, in consequence of the expiration of his term of office, the person who occupied that position was on the eve of entering upon a new canvass for the suffrages of his fellow-citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The candidate for the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName> conceived the idea of laying the political candidate under personal obligations by undertaking the advocacy of his interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>He went from village to village, haranguing the electors, extolling the merits of the individual from whom he expected, in return, to obtain his admission to the academy, and the people were impressed <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> by his speeches and his youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The member was reelected, and <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00018.00029" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> entered <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>But if the terms of admission do not guarantee the worth of the candidate who is admitted, in the school itself the studies are rigorous and prolonged, and the discipline is very severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>All those who have not obtained a certain number of marks are excluded at the annual examinations, and by this means a portion only of the pupils succeed at the expiration of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> in obtaining admission into the army with the rank of second lieutenant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> are devoted alike, by all the pupils, to special studies, and to obtaining a knowledge of engineering and artillery practice; it is a necessary condition of the profession which awaits them on leaving the academy; indeed, the greater part of them, before entering a regiment of the line, undergo a probation of some years in the artillery corps,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The rest, constantly isolated at distant points among <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00018.00030" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, are obliged, in order to attain efficiency, to acquire a knowledge of every branch of the military profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>This general instruction is, moreover, in harmony with the national spirit, which readily believes in its capacity to do everything, and in which the initiative of individual efforts, strongly developed, rectifies the abuses of that system of specialties which is too often fatal to independence of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>A solitary example will show that, in bestowing this varied instruction, which enables officers to pass from <num value="1">one</num> branch of the service to another, the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> system does not, on that account, lower the standard of its studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Only a few years ago all the professors had officers of the army for assistants, who, each in turn, forsook the active and solitary life of the <rs>Western</rs> prairies, to become, for the term of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, the scientific instructors of those pupils who had replaced them on the benches of the academy, and who were soon to become their comrades in the ranks of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The pupils, instead of paying for the privileges of such excellent education, <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> receive, on the contrary, a considerable salary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Consequently, the <rs>Federal</rs> government is somewhat entitled to their loyalty, and had the right to prefer charges of ingratitude against those who, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, placed at the service of its enemies the knowledge they had thus acquired under the auspices of the <rs>Federal</rs> flag.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Thanks to their long and serious studies, which kept them aloof from their fellow-citizens, always in a hurry to act and to enjoy&mdash;thanks to the bonds of fellowship which the associations of youth implant in the heart of man, and especially to those attacks of which both the academy and the army had been the subject&mdash;the <name>West Pointers</name> very soon formed an almost aristocratic and exclusive body, all the members of which mutually sustained each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>At the period of which we are speaking, those who remained under the flag were animated by a genuine passion for the profession of arms; for such a feeling alone could have induced men of capacity and energy to lead a rugged and unremunerating life, without even finding the reward of their labors in public sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Those who, tired out by the slowness of promotion, and attracted by more brilliant prospects, quitted the service after a few years (and they were numerous, especially among the young men of the <rs>North</rs>), did not forget their early education on that account; it was, therefore, among these that the <rs>Federal</rs> cause recruited its most brilliant defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>These changes in the pursuits of life did not break the bonds which united all West Pointers together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>If this <hi rend="italics">coterie</hi>&mdash;for it was <num value="1">one</num>&mdash;could, with all its defects and partialities, maintain itself and cause itself to be respected in the midst of a society so fluctuating, it is because it was governed by the noblest sentiments of honor and military duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Preserving the most valuable traditions by the side of successive administrations essentially changeable in their character, it was found ready, notwithstanding many desertions, to organize the scattered forces of the nation on the day when the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders gave the signal of civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>That great task accomplished, the <hi rend="italics">coterie</hi> disappeared, even in the midst of the triumph to which it had so powerfully contributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>After such a struggle, it will not be asked of the general who has commanded in <num value="20">twenty</num> battles whether he is or is not a <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> West Pointer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The public, which had regarded the regular officer as a being apart from the rest of mankind, and almost dangerous, has seen him at work, knows his patriotism, and has given him its confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>And the latter, forgetting the derisive nickname of <hi rend="italics">mustang</hi> (<name>Indian</name> name for wild horse), which he was wont to apply to inexperienced volunteers before the advent of the common trial, now respects them, and seeks his associates among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The great drama in which they have played their respective parts side by side, in breaking down the old barriers and blotting out past distinctions, has created a new fraternity among them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The <orgName n="West Point Academy" type="academy">West Point Academy</orgName>, since its origin, has always supplied the army with the greatest portion of its officers; but the <rs>President</rs> has never been restricted in his appointment of officers to selections among the graduates of that institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>As <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>, he is not bound by any law, either as regards admission or promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>When the number and the various grades have once been defined and settled by Congress, he can distribute them as he thinks proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>But his power is subjected to the will of the <name>Senate</name>&mdash;that great political body which plays the principal role in the <rs>Federal</rs> constitution, and whose province it is to confirm every nomination, which otherwise becomes null and void by the tacit operation of the law, at the close of the legislative session in which it was presented for consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The Senate has always made ample use of this prerogative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>From the general to the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-2">second lieutenant</rs>, each candidate has his claims discussed before this assembly, which, if need be, becomes the interpreter of public sentiment against too glaring acts of favoritism, but which, under the influence of party spirit, is also sometimes led into error in the exercise of these delicate functions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The executive power, however, took care to impose upon itself a rule, and to fortify the hierarchical spirit by introducing the principle of promotion by seniority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>This system of promotion was established through the promulgation of certain ordinances, styled <hi rend="italics">Articles of War</hi>, which comprise, at the same time, instructions for the officers, and a series of military regulations which, although liable to be revoked by the <rs>President</rs>, have, nevertheless, come to be considered as a true code of laws for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/><pb id="p.21" n="21"/></p> 
<p>Promotion by seniority is a wise rule of action in a republic where the administrative power so frequently changes hands, and where the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the government is almost entirely renewed on the occasion of each change; for although the <rs>President</rs> is allowed perfect freedom of choice in the formation of new regiments, it secures true independence to the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Up to the rank of captain this promotion takes place in the regiment; to that of colonel, in the arm. Seniority of rank has nothing to do with the appointment of general officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> had, nevertheless, numerous occasions for the exercise of his patronage outside of all hierarchical regulations; indeed, the standing nucleus of the army was so weak that at every sign of war it was necessary to increase it in haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The value of traditions was as yet so little appreciated in the various branches of the service that more than once, for instance, considerations of economy have caused the sudden discharge of all the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>And too often, when new <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi> had to be formed, the <rs>President</rs>, forgetful that young soldiers require experienced leaders, only reserved a few places for the officers taken from the other corps of the army; the rest were divided among old volunteers, officers who had resigned their respective commissions and were desirous to resume the epaulette, and especially political favorites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Those who attained superior grades assumed at once their seniority of rank in that entire branch of the service, and preserved it when the corps to the formation of which they were indebted for their rapid elevation was disbanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>This system, however, occasionally gave the army some excellent soldiers, who, although not graduates of <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName>, did not the less display great military talents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Finally, a custom, singular enough in a republic, borrowed from the <rs>British</rs> army, that of <hi rend="italics">brevet rank</hi>, or honorary promotion, enabled the <rs>President</rs> to confer, in the way of rewards, titles which were wholly independent of the rules of seniority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>These, however, only conferred superiority of rank in regard to what was strictly honorary, giving no increase of pay, and serving in no way to assist promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The recipient of the brevet continued to perform the functions of the inferior grade; and <num value="1">one</num> might thus see a simple captain in command of a company wearing the insignia of a lieutenant-colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>This system, so much at <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> variance with the spirit of military subordination, was largely in vogue, because, through its operation, the self-love and vanity of many people could be gratified without loosening the purse-strings of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>At the close of the civil war, in <num value="1">one</num> regiment alone, counting <num value="45">forty-five</num> officers, <num value="21">twenty-one</num> of them received brevets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>By a natural reaction against the spirit of social equality peculiar to the country, an almost impassable barrier had been raised in the regular army between soldiers and officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It required some splendid achievement to enable the non-commissioned officer, ennobled by the epaulettes, to take a seat among his former chiefs, and it was only in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> that a commission was appointed for the examination and regular admission of a certain number of non-commissioned officers to the rank of officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The material of which the rank and file was composed did, in fact, justify that exclusiveness; for it fully deserved the name of mercenary, subsequently so unjustly applied to the volunteers of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>These troops were recruited among emigrants who had not been able to secure better means of existence; for that mode of life which required entire submission to the discipline of the barracks, even in the midst of the desert, held out but few inducements to the <rs>Americans</rs> themselves, who never sought to adopt it unless driven to it by sheer necessity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The regular officer, in short, isolated at some distant post, like a sea-captain on board his vessel, always exposed to the perfidy of the <rs>Indian</rs>, and obliged to be constantly on his guard, maintained his authority by means of the strictest discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The disproportion between the salaries of different grades was less than amongst us; for in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> it is not thought that a faithful performance of duty in public offices can be secured by allowing the lower ranks of employes to vegetate under the pressure of insufficient pay, while a few superior officers only enjoy high salaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>A lieutenant receives under various forms an annual salary of <num value="5500">fifty-five hundred</num> francs; a colonel, <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> francs; and a major-general, <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> francs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>They could undoubtedly, therefore&mdash;all of them&mdash;economize to some extent, especially when they had to pass half their lives in the wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>At all events, it was but little compared with what their former comrades of <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName> earned in the various pursuits of industry and commerce.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>There is, moreover, a radical difference between the system of public salaries in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and our own. Unless an officer can procure a pension through the instrumentality of honorable wounds, it is all over with him on the day he is discharged from active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>In return for his time and trouble he is liberally paid so long as the contract in virtue of which he was mustered into service is in existence; but this contract between the <rs>President</rs> and himself is always liable to be revoked by either of the contracting parties, and if <num value="1">one</num> has always the right to tender his resignation, the other is equally entitled to dismiss him whenever he pleases&mdash;there is no retiring list, and, consequently, no limit as to age.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>If the <rs>American</rs> officer tenders his resignation or is mustered out, without any previous notice, with the regiment to which he belonged, he launches at once into other pursuits until the formation of some new regiment, when he is almost certain, if worthy of it, to regain his former position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>He who has remained faithful to the profession of arms has laid up something against the day of his possible discharge, when he may console himself by saying that it is never too late in life to strive after fortune.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Before concluding this chapter it remains for us to speak of the organization of the different corps which composed the regular army; for although their effective strength has been subjected to strange vicissitudes, the organization itself has experienced but few changes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The cavalry, which was disbanded after the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, only dates, with the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">first regiment</orgName> of dragoons, from the year <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> was created in <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>, the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, as also the <hi rend="italics">mounted riflemen</hi>, which, being formed solely to serve in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, made the campaign on foot, notwithstanding their appellation of <hi rend="italics">mounted</hi> riflemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>In <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> Congress passed a law authorizing the formation of <num value="2">two</num> new regiments of cavalry, and <persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n0321.0003.00024.00031" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, then <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, took advantage of the fact that they had not been designated by the title of dragoons to treat them as a different arm, and to fill them with his creatures, to the exclusion of regular officers whom he disliked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>In <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> these <num value="5">five</num> regiments were united under the simple designation of cavalry, and a <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> was added to their number.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The number of infantry regiments varied frequently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>During the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> it reached <num value="17">seventeen</num>; then it was again reduced, but never below <num value="8">eight</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The artillery, on the contrary, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> regiments, preserved that organization until <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, but the number of companies <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> of which they were composed varied according to the exigencies of the service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>All the regiments were organized in the same manner, each being provided with <num value="10">ten</num> captains, whose command took the name of company, even in the cavalry and the artillery, where it corresponded with the terms squadron and battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The regiments of infantry, instead of comprising <num value="3">three</num> battalions, were formed, in reality, of but a single <num value="1">one</num>; but each had a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, and a major, the division of the regiments among the frontier stations and along the coast rendering this large number of superior officers necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Their effective total of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> to <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> men was seldom attained, recruiting being always difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>A wise ordinance of <persName n="Monroe,President,,,," id="n0321.0003.00025.00032" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName> requiring that every reduction of the army should bear equally upon all organized regiments, those only could be discharged whose strength was found to be diminished by more than <num value="0.5">one-half</num>, in order to preserve complete <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi> ready to receive recruits in case of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Unfortunately, however, while the observance of this rule was being enforced, the authorities, in the exercise of an imprudent economy, neglected to fill the vacancies of officers in the regiments thus reduced; so that in the end the <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi> were found to be as insignificant as the total effective force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The proportion of artillery up to <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and its immunity from any important reductions, can be explained on the ground of the valuable services constantly required of it. It has always had the charge of occupying, maintaining, and arming the fortified posts which have served, and still serve, as finger-posts to the march of civilization across the prairies of the <rs>West</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The somewhat numerous body of officers of the <orgName n="Engineer Corps" type="corps">engineer corps</orgName> enjoyed the same immunity, but, generally speaking, it never had but about <num value="100">one hundred</num> soldiers under its command, who were at the same time sappers and pontoniers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>As to the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>, such a branch of the military service has never existed in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The small regular army having only been brought together once during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="46years" type="date">forty-six years</measure> of its existence, the want of such a corps was but little felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>During the <rs>Mexican</rs> expedition the army suffered greatly on account of this blank, but in the corps of engineers it found young and excellent officers <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> who, by their zeal and intelligence, supplied the want of a <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It was only, therefore, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, when it was no longer a question of handling <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> regular troops, but <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> volunteers, that all the inconveniences arising from the absence of such an important machinery were sensibly felt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The functions of the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> were divided among different corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Officers detached from their regiments, and volunteers invested with temporary rank, performed the duties of aides-decamp to the generals under the name of personal aides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>All the topographical, geodetical, and hydrographical works were entrusted to the corps of topographical engineers, to whom we are indebted for the handsome publications of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Coast Survey" type="military">Coast Survey</orgName></hi>, and who, in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, were merged into the <orgName n="Engineer Corps" type="corps">engineer corps</orgName>, just as our geographical engineers were formerly merged into the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The other functions of the latter corps, particularly those concerning the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of armies in the field, were entrusted to special officers of administration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Any details regarding the administration of military affairs, although greatly abridged, may appear long and tedious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Still they are necessary; for we must know the interior mechanism of an army in order fully to understand its movements, and its organization is a, mirror wherein its spirit is reflected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>That of the regular army, like <num value="1">one</num> of those diminutive models every part of which is equally enlarged and amplified by some ingenious process, was exactly copied at the time when the hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of volunteers, whose campaigns we shall have to narrate, were mustered into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>In this narrative we shall have to use technical <name>English</name> terms in order to designate military functions, the exact equivalents of which do not exist among us, and the precise meaning of which it is, therefore, necessary that we should establish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The administration of the <rs>American</rs> <orgName n="War Department" type="department">war department</orgName> is divided into <num value="2">two</num> technical parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>On <num value="1">one</num> hand the body of troops, cavalry, artillery, and infantry, divided into regiments, depend, without intermedium, on the department bureaus, having neither distinctive chief nor separate management; on the other hand, there are corps composed exclusively of officers, each of them <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> under the special direction of a general officer or colonel, almost invariably placed in that position by right of seniority, who takes a large share in all the decisions which affect them, and who is the only medium between them and the department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The latter corps are, in the first place, the engineers and topographical engineers, separated until <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and united since that period; and then the various branches of the service, much more independent of each other, which, with us, constitute the military administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Under the name of departments they perform their functions both in the army and in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, where their hierarchical chiefs have each a separate bureau, which nearly corresponds to our administrative divisions(<hi rend="italics">directions</hi>).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>In these varied functions the corps above mentioned partake of the character of our supervising department (<hi rend="italics">intendance</hi>), with this important difference, however, that most of them are composed of officers in active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Taken from the army, with the exception of paymasters and surgeons, who have simply an assimilated military rank, they do not leave their army grade on entering upon the discharge of departmental duties, and may, by means of a simple exchange, resume their places in the ranks of combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They have therefore the same prospects as the latter, and may, like them, come out of their respective <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> with a general's epaulette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The late war has shown by many examples the advantages of such a system of promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Thus, <num value="1">one</num> of the generals who achieved most distinction on the field of battle, <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00027.00033" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, a simple captain-quartermaster, commanded with success an <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, and was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general in the regular army for his services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Hence it is that rivalries and jealousies are very rare between officers of the line and those of the staff corps, and the frequency of rotation among them, by initiating each in turn into the details of every branch of the service, imparts to them an amount of information that is found invaluable in the isolated life of the frontiers, which entails upon them such manifold duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Here, again, the <rs>Americans</rs> have done well in not pushing the system of special services to excess.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>'s department, composed of officers from the rank of captain to that of colonel, was, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, commanded <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> by a general of brigade, who combined the functions of superintendent of the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the department with those of chief of staff to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Adjutant-General">assistant adjutant-generals</rs>, his subordinates, are divided into <num value="2">two</num> classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Some doing duty in the bureaus, or detached on special service, perform administrative functions; the others, for the most part, perform the duties of our chiefs and sub-chiefs of staff to the several generals in command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Inspector General">inspector-general</rs>'s department, although independent of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>'s, is, in reality, but a supplementary branch of it; and being composed solely of a few superior officers, it has only the character of a commission to inspect the troops of the line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The quartermaster and subsistence departments resemble in most respects our supervising department (<hi rend="italics">intendance</hi>).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The former, organized since <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, besides the duty of providing part of the supplies for the army, performs certain functions which, with us, appertain to the departments of engineers, transportation, and disbursement of public moneys, and is the most important of all the department bureaus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>During the late war it disbursed <num value="0.43">forty-three per cent.</num> of the total amount required for military expenses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The <orgName n="Subsistence department" type="department">subsistence department</orgName>, having charge of the victualling of troops, the purchase of provisions at scattered markets, the preparation, preservation, and distribution of rations among the regiments, is composed of officers styled commissaries; at the beginning of the war a colonel was at the head of this department.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">ordnance department</orgName> exercises the administrative functions which with us belong, for the most part, to the artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It has not only charge of the arsenals, of the manufacture of arms and <rs n="military equipments" type="product">military equipments</rs>, of cannon and artillery material, of muskets and ammunition of every kind, of side-arms, saddles, and harness accoutrements, but also of their distribution in each corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We find this department in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> under the direction of a brigadier-general.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The departments of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Quartermaster">quartermaster</rs>, subsistence, and ordnance are represented on the staff of each army, <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, active or territorial division, brigade, and regiment, by <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> officers who, while subject to the authority of the chiefs of those corps, continue nevertheless to maintain direct relations with their respective departments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Finally, the surgeons and paymasters form <num value="2">two</num> civil corps, the members of which, as we have said before, being simply assimilated in rank to military grades, cannot be transferred from <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They follow in their own a regular order of promotion, and each class is placed respectively under the command of a surgeon-general and a paymaster-general.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/><emph>T</emph>HE organization of the <rs>American</rs> army was not developed in the midst of absolute peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> war and an almost continuous warfare with the <rs>Indian</rs> tribes justified its existence in the eyes of a jealous public, kept it always in working order, and permitted it to acquire a useful experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>They developed its qualities, while the nature of the country where the <rs>American</rs> army had to fight, and the enemies it encountered, exercised a powerful influence upon its character and its mode of waging war. The <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> campaign constitutes the most brilliant epoch in its history previous to the great struggle of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>That campaign was the means of forming nearly all the military chiefs who, on <num value="1">one</num> side or the other, have been noted in the combats we shall have to describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>It inspired the stories of the <hi rend="italics">bivouac</hi> <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> later, when the captain and the lieutenant of <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, now in command of volunteer armies or <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, found themselves opposed to the companions of their early experiences in arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> had not been a glorious <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>That of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, on the contrary, was a series of successes scarcely interrupted by a few insignificant checks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>It offered the soldier all the interest of regular warfare, with its pitched battles, the names of which can be mentioned and their trophies shown, and at the same time all the attractions that adventurous spirits find in fighting in a country but half civilized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It was, in short, a decisive trial of the military institutions of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>; if the regular soldiers had already been inured to the privations and fatigues that awaited them in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, if the mongrel race they had to encounter there was not superior in courage to the <name>Indians</name> of the prairies, they had never before been brought together as <num value="1">one</num> army, nor fought otherwise than as partisans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> war was <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> essentially their work; they were in a majority in the <orgName>army of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0321.0003.00031.00034" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName></orgName>, who made the decisive campaign; the volunteers were only their auxiliaries; and even where the latter happened to be more numerous than the former, the regular officers retained, nevertheless, the exclusive control of all operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Those volunteers did not much resemble the class in the same service who, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, truly represented the nation in arms, for no enthusiasm had stimulated their enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The war which was undertaken against <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> was iniquitous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>To accomplish this it was deemed necessary to dismember <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and to introduce slavery into the territories that would be taken from her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The <rs>North</rs> repudiated this odious policy; consequently, it was only represented by a contingent of less than <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> volunteers, and even the majority of these only entered the service to sustain the national honor, when <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00031.00037" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>, detained at <placeName key="tgn,7007118" n="1.000 1" reg="puebla,puebla,mexico,north and central america">Puebla</placeName> for want of troops, found himself seriously compromised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>About <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> volunteers from the <rs>South</rs>, a force which was then considered very large, were successively mustered into service: the hope of extending the domain of slavery had fired their ardor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Ambitious, impetuous, and eloquent, this old West Pointer was trying to achieve at the same time popularity with his party, and the military reputation which, when the crisis came, was to place him in possession of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>He accomplished that double object; and at a later period, when the great rebellion, of which he was the soul, broke out, he received the honors of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Confed1">first Confederate</orgName> successes; but when defeat followed, his former accomplices accused him of having accelerated <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> the common ruin by imperiously trammelling generals abler than himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>But, generally speaking, let us remark again, these <orgName n="Southern Volunteers" type="volunteers">Southern volunteers</orgName> did not resemble those who would have taken up arms in support of a truly national cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>They were, for the most part, adventurers recruited from among that idle, restless, and adventurous population which the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders had made the pioneers of their institutions and had alternately thrust upon the <name>Antilles</name> and the far <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>They were not without military qualifications: always with rifle in hand, by turns soldiers, colonists, or traders, they had already fought as improvised citizens of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> at the time when the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> were contending for the supremacy of influence in that ephemeral republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>But the remainder of that long period was not a time of peace and rest for it, inasmuch as it was occupied by incessant conflicts with the descendants of the ancient possessors of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>When this army was charged with the protection of the frontiers of the newly-settled States, the <name>Indians</name> living east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> had not yet been driven into the far <rs>West</rs>, nor politically absorbed by the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>But the latter was already crowding upon them, stifling them within narrow limits, and in proportion as its settlements extended, it successively despoiled them of their domains, and removed them, partly with their consent and partly by force, to some district yet too far distant to excite the cupidity of the whites, where a new place of exile was assigned them under the name of <hi rend="italics">Indian Reservation</hi>. The aboriginal race, which often submitted to these sad migrations with the indifference of fatalism, would also at times resist the conquerors who imposed them with all the energy of despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>When the struggle between the pioneer abusing his superior intelligence, and the savage trying to find in the expedients of cunning some help for his weakness, became embittered, the little American army, summoned to the assistance of the settlers or the <rs>Federal</rs> agents, found itself engaged in a murderous, toilsome, and obscure war. Sometimes it had to take part in skirmishes which were important only on account of the magnitude of the losses it sustained in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Thus, in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, a conflict took place on the yet unfrequented borders of the <rs>Tallapoosa</rs>, in which the <rs>American</rs> cavalry lost over <num value="200">two hundred</num> men, and the <rs type="place">Creek</rs> tribe, vanquished <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> after a desperate struggle, left more than <num value="1000">one thousand</num> warriors on the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>The tribe which offered the longest resistance was that of the <name>Seminoles</name>, once a powerful nation, always haughty and warlike, gradually driven by the whites into the low lands which form the peninsula of <placeName key="tgn,7007240" n="1.000 9" reg="florida">Florida</placeName>, in the south-eastern portion of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7007240" n="1.000 9" reg="florida">Florida</placeName> war, often rekindled after deceitful attempts at pacification, was long and cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The <rs>Indians</rs>, exasperated by repeated instances of bad faith on the part of the whites, gave no quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Reduced in number by the unequal contest, they sought shelter among the inaccessible recesses of the <name>Everglades</name>&mdash;vast woody swamps where the cypress, the magnolia, and the palmetto preserve an eternal verdure&mdash;and at the approach of the whites they would disappear with their light canoes in a labyrinth of channels of which they alone knew the secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The <rs>Americans</rs>, taking advantage of their divisions and the exhaustion of all their resources, went at last to find them in this last refuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>It was a trying campaign for the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Water and the forest interposed a double obstacle to his progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The ground gave way under his feet, and he was alternately obliged to creep slowly across the swamps, or to get into some fragile canoe and open himself a passage between the trees, each of which might conceal a foe. He had nothing to guide him but the track left on the muddy bottom by the <rs>Indian</rs> in his flight towards his secret place of refuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>This refuge generally consisted of an elevated piece of ground called a hummock, covered with thick vegetation, in the midst of which the indigenous families were sheltered in a rude village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>This islet was usually surrounded by open lagoons, and the moment the whites emerged from the forest they were exposed to a well-sustained fire from a concealed enemy, who was determined to die rather than give up his possessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Decimated by sickness, hunger, and, above all, by the fatal abuse of <hi rend="italics">fire-water</hi>, the sad remnants of this proud race embarked for New Orleans, and thence proceeded to the prairies of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, where that civilization which they only knew as an inveterate foe was soon again to find them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>This struggle had lasted <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure>, and although the <rs>American</rs> army always endeavored to mitigate the evils of that cruel policy of which it was the instrument, the remembrance of the valiant resistance of those poor savages, of the losses they inflicted upon that army, and, above all, of their miserable end, remained as a gloomy recollection among military traditions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Such conquests constitute the noblest mission of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Abounding in useful lessons, thanks to the varied labors and the individual responsibility they impose upon every man, they form an excellent school for an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Colonization, which, under the powerful influence of true and rational liberty, progresses rapidly in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, asks no power, civil or military, to <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> direct it or to think for it. But the squatter, who will not separate the rifle from the axe, sometimes carries the love of independence to excess, and in the struggle of the new civilization against Nature and against the imperfect society of the <name>Indians</name>, the intervention of a superior power, strong and impartial, often becomes necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>This was the part the <rs>American</rs> officers were called upon to play.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>They alone represented the <rs>Federal</rs> government, which was at once the ruler and sole proprietor of those vast tracts of country; they entered into a contest with the still virgin nature, very different from those conflicts in which they had been engaged with the <name>Indians</name>, for it had the happy privilege of leaving no captives in its train; but the victory had to be purchased at the price of patient efforts that can only be expected from military devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Their splendid geodetical labors were intermingled with some of the strangest adventures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Demarkations of frontier lines, hydrographical surveys of coasts and rivers, geological inquiries, researches in natural history, were at once undertaken by those indefatigable pioneers of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Their reports, published by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, notwithstanding their length, form the most complete and interesting collection of historical records of colonization in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>The solitary life they led induced many who had not even received an official appointment to join in these pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>It is true that at times some untoward accident interfered with their peculiar tastes; a geologist would be stationed in a plain where he could not find a single stone; a botanist in a sterile desert; but nearly all of them found some opportunity to help the march of progress in the study of the new countries which had been acquired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>They had, however, other duties to perform besides these peaceful labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> of the <rs>West</rs>, although not cornered, like the <name>Seminoles</name>, and obliged to fight or to surrender, did not give way without resistance before the never-ebbing tide <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> of the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>The extent of their territory, which enabled them to refuse or to accept a combat, and always to select the moment and the place favorable for the attack, rendered it much more difficult to conquer them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>By a wise precaution against local outbreaks, all relations with the <name>Indians</name> were confided to the <rs>President</rs>, who styled himself their great father at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; and the lands which they occupied, not belonging to any State, were under the immediate jurisdiction of his government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The management of these relations was divided among <name>Indian</name> agents in the civil employ of the government, who had charge of all fiscal matters, the distribution of lands, and the collection of taxes; while the army, as the guardian of public order, made use both of diplomacy and the force of arms to maintain it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>It had a difficult part to perform, for it was placed between the new civilization&mdash;represented by the <hi rend="italics">squatter</hi>, who pretends to exercise the right of prior occupancy over all the lands where he finds only red-skins; by the dealer in ardent spirits, who carries his fatal poison to the very <hi rend="italics">wigwam</hi>&mdash;and the <rs>Indian</rs> tribe, which requires vast uncultivated spaces for its existence, and a degree of independence incompatible with an improved state of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Although the <rs>Americans</rs> have been accused of systematically destroying the <rs>Indian</rs> race, their army, on the contrary, has frequently assumed the defence of these unfortunate people against the destructive contact with the white man. It has endeavored to smooth the way for their adoption of civilized customs, without, however, seeking to perpetuate the rude organization of the system of tribes, which it rather sought to destroy, as opposed to every kind of progress, by favoring those who renounced their wandering modes of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The <name>Indian</name> tribe, in fact, resembles greatly the <name>Arab</name> tribes, but more particularly those tribes&mdash;nomadic as in the times of <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>&mdash;which inhabit the deserts of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>, than those we have found in the <name>Tell</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7016752" n="1.000 6" reg="algeria">Algeria</placeName>, possessing already a limited territory, portions of which they cultivate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The latter, although they represent a more advanced condition of society, or rather on account of that fact, are much more antagonistic to modern civilization; their system, in short, is founded on a religion exclusive and political, and on territorial regulations which admit community of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>The <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> religion of the <rs>Indian</rs>, like that of the <name>Bedouin</name>, is, on the contrary, so simple and so vague, that it does not repel as an enemy the religion we bring to him; while the property of both&mdash;consisting only in tents, arms, and horses in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>, of herds of cattle in the <rs>Old</rs>&mdash;is essentially individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The tribe-system, therefore, is only a weak political tie&mdash;a simple extension of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>In their intercourse with these primitive people, the <rs>Americans</rs> have always taken care that their progress should not result in consolidating the organization of the tribes, but have rather tried to merge its elements into the great <orgName n="Modern Society" type="society">modern society</orgName> which is rapidly spreading all over the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Therefore, under the influence of the examples of civilization, a great number of Indians have abandoned the nomadic ways of life, and, casting aside the traditions of the past, have ceased their hostility to the whites when they have become tillers of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>American policy has devised various means to win their attachment, either through interest or fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>After taxing them at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the <rs>Federal</rs> government changed its mode of proceeding, and bought their lands, giving them annuities in exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>It thus made them submissive pensioners, while it narrowed the limits of the tribe's hunting-grounds, which were a barrier against colonization; and in order that this domain might not become, in the hands of the tribes, a real collective property, it imposed upon them the alternative, as soon as the tide of civilization began to approach, either to emigrate <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>, or to divide their lands among themselves, by securing a lot to every Indian who desired to become a tiller of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>In thus destroying the social organization of the tribes, the government, however, still respected their political system, with a view of imposing upon them a collective responsibility for all the crimes which might be committed by their members&mdash;the only effective guarantee of the police of the desert This process of primitive justice was abandoned as soon as the division and individual cultivation of the lands had rendered the change of customs permanent, and the political system of the tribe gradually gave place to an ordinary municipality, while its members became citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>No prejudice of color interposed any obstacle to this work of absorption, which is still carried on to this day, and the <rs>State</rs> of <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> New York itself has several villages of civilized <name>Indians</name> who, although preserving the type and the traditions of their race, are in every respect the equals of the old settlers around them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The American army had, therefore, a double task to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> hand, it had to maintain the national authority over the <rs>Indian</rs> tribes, to see that the treaties concluded with them were faithfully executed, and to impress them with the wholesome conviction that from <num value="1">one</num> end of the continent to the other all the whites would take up arms, if necessary, to avenge any outrage committed on a single individual belonging to their class; and, in order to accomplish this, the army had occasionally to resort to force, and sometimes to negotiations, in which the sword gave them, in the eyes of those savages, great advantages over the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Agent">civil agents</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>On the other hand, it was frequently obliged to interfere against the white adventurers, either to protect the ancient owners of the soil from their violence, or to restore order in the midst of a new community where the most antagonistic elements were at work; or, finally, to enforce respect for the superior authority of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, which was easily disregarded amid the vehement quarrels of those distant regions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Consequently, the army was always, if not in war, at least in watchful anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>Having to watch the <name>Apaches</name> and the <name>Comanches</name>, who infested the passes of the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs> on the side of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>, the <rs>Sioux</rs> on the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">Upper</rs> Missouri</placeName>, the <hi rend="italics">Nez Perces</hi> and the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Coeur</foreName></persName> d'alene</hi>&mdash;warlike tribes from the shores of <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>&mdash;it was scattered over an immense territory, and had, besides, to hold itself always in readiness to repel a sudden attack or to punish the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of hostility committed against any new settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>This rough and adventurous life gave to the <rs>American</rs> officer the habit of command, of responsibility, and of individual <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> enterprise&mdash;qualities which go to form the warrior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Most of them became passionately attached to it, for the life of the desert has for the soldier, as well as for the traveller, an attraction which those who have once tasted it never cease to regret.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>The supply-train, that ball-and-chain which every civilized army has to drag along, carried all that it could need during the expedition; for among a hunting people like the <name>Indians</name> there could not be found even such feeble resources as our <hi rend="italics">razzias</hi> procured among the <name>Arab</name> shepherds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>At the crossing of every deep river, all the wagons had to be unloaded and set afloat, so as to be drawn to the opposite shore by ropes; then the provisions had to be carried by hand over the bridges constructed for the use of the infantry, like rafts, of trunks of trees tied together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Always on horseback, the <name>Indians</name> <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> were indebted to their animals for that rapidity of movement which constituted their strength in attack and their safety in flight, and which, even when they had not yet adopted the use of the rifle, compensated more than once for the inferiority of their arrows as compared with the firearms of the <rs>Americans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>It was at the moment when the white race came to dispute the possession of the new continent, that a just <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> placed in their hands this precious and powerful auxiliary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The horse became the indispensable companion of their new existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Living solely by hunting, they made themselves absolute masters of the art of surprises and ambuscades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Fearing neither to risk their lives in the most dangerous enterprises, nor to seek refuge in flight when their attack had failed, rather than wait for an irreparable defeat by keeping their ground, their bands alternately increased and disappeared in the twinkling of an eye, like <num value="1">one</num> of those light fogs which rise from the prairie wet with dew, and which are condensed and dissolved by turns under the influence of an early morning sun.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>It has often happened to a column to march for weeks without seeing an enemy, who, however, has been following it step by step, ready to spring upon it at the least sign of weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Woe, then, to him who, through an imprudent confidence, strays too far from his comrades!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>he never again makes his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>After a day's march, which the want of water has prolonged, when the camp-fires, smouldering in their ashes, are dying out, and silence and darkness prevail everywhere, a strange cry is sometimes heard, which is responded to by other cries in opposite directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>While the men are waking up and making inquiries, a confused noise comes from the corral where the artillery horses and the train mules are picketed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Some <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00068.00140" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, creeping in unnoticed, have adroitly cut their fastenings, and, taking advantage of the confusion they have created, have dashed off on their own horses to stampede the drove of frightened animals and direct their course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>These rush off at once like a whirlwind, trampling <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> down every obstacle in their way; and, still guided by their savage leaders, soon disappear, leaving the whites stupefied and powerless as boatmen without oars on a stormy sea. The word <hi rend="italics">stampede</hi>, used to designate a panic among horses, was applied during the civil war to those commotions which too often led undisciplined troops into a disorderly flight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>But these surprises were of rare occurrence with officers accustomed to the tactics of the wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>They opposed vigilance to cunning, tenacity to agility, and, finally, friendly Indians to hostile <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00069.00141" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>These native allies accompanied the column in the capacity of guides, and frequently as scouts, fighting in a halfcivilized fashion&mdash;handling their rifles skilfully, but furtively taking off the scalp of the vanquished when they could do so without being seen by their allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>In short, while they would discover, with the instinct of a hunting-dog, the <hi rend="italics">cache</hi> (hiding place) where the hostile tribe had deposited their winter provisions, the <rs>American</rs> cavalry rivalled them in dexterity, and succeeded at times, by a bold stroke, in capturing, in their turn, droves of half-wild horses which the <rs>Indian</rs> chiefs always kept in reserve to remount their warriors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the last expeditions that went out before the civil war, in <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>, a party which left <placeName reg="Fort Vancouver, Clark, Washington" key="tgn,7017652">Fort Vancouver</placeName> on the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>, after dispersing the <name>Pelouse</name> tribe, captured their horses in this manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>The <rs>Indians</rs>, knowing the untamable nature of those animals, and full of confidence in their own skill, relied upon being able to steal them again from their new masters by means of a stampede, and to make use of them in a few days to resume hostilities; so that when, on the following day, surveying the <rs>American</rs> camp from a distance with a spy-glass, taken from an officer who had been killed the preceding year, they saw the ground covered with the carcases of their <num value="770">seven hundred and seventy</num> horses, they felt so discouraged that they acknowledged themselves conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The commander of the expedition, divining their intention, had called a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName>, and the latter&mdash;not without much regret, for men who have lived long in the desert cannot be cruel to animals&mdash;had ordered the poor beasts to be shot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>Notwithstanding all these surprises, the <rs>Indian</rs> and the white man almost always ended by measuring strength in an open and <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> decisive battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>For if the former accepted war, it was because he felt sure of victory; and as soon as he saw his stratagems baffled by his enemy, the same confidence impelled him to attempt an attack by main force; then, in almost every instance, the cool courage of the white man, his discipline, and the superiority of his arms made his success certain, although he seldom obtained it until after a long and bloody struggle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>The various arms of the service had each a share in the hardships and dangers of these incessant wars; through them they preserved their activity and their military traditions, and acquired a new experience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>The task of the foot-soldier was the hardest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>The fine rivers which furrow the prairie are separated by intervals of from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="12">twelve</num> leagues, which had to be travelled in a single stage, by forcing a passage through the tall grasses, without a tree to shelter the soldier for an instant from the burning heat of the sun, or a drop of water to slake his thirst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>On the morrow, before being able to resume his march, he had to cut the necessary materials for the construction of floating bridges along the steep banks of the river; or, if the expedition was lightly equipped, to cross a deep river by riding double behind the mounted men. To the burning heat of a summer, which no sea-breezes temper, were added the prairie-fire, the sudden storms of wind and rain so terrible on the <rs type="place">Plains</rs>, where there is nothing to allay their violence; then the cold and the snow followed in quick succession, bringing new sufferings to the troops they overtook, like those of <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00070.00142" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Sidney,,,:1"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>Such a life formed marchers trained to long stages; but campaigning in a desert, where they carried everything with them, and unable to separate themselves for more than <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> from their train, they were accustomed to a certain abundance of food and regular supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Consequently, when, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, war was to be waged in a country not altogether destitute of resources, the officers who had been brought up in that school did not dream of turning those resources to account, so as to render themselves independent of the supply-trains, until <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00070.00143" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had abandoned this system.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>In regard to the cavalry, this <name>Indian</name> war was an excellent preparation for the part it was soon called upon to play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>These <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> American dragoons, who for so many years had lived scattered among the <name>Indians</name>, were not indeed elegant horsemen, nor even good manoeuvrers on field parade, and did not understand war as our soldiers do, who, whether in line or as foragers, only depend upon the point of their sabres or the swiftness of their horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>But the necessities of a special war had taught them to vindicate their name, by performing the complicated duties for which, in the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century, the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">first regiments</orgName> of mounted infantry were formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>In order to reach the <name>Indians</name> in their last retreats, and deal rapid chastisement to the minor tribes, they frequently undertook short campaigns without taking any supply-trains with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>Carrying their ammunition, biscuits, coffee, etc., on their animals, they were followed only by a few led horses laden with a reserve of provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>The marches were long and the rations small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>When the enemy was at last reached, he was almost invariably attacked with firearms, for he did not allow himself to come within reach of sidearms, any more than the wild bird allows himself to be taken by the sportsman with the hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>The use of the rifle, moreover, gave the <rs>Americans</rs> great advantage over their adversaries, who, for the most part, had nothing but bows and arrows or very poor muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>They omitted no opportunity to use that weapon; and whether for the purpose of striking the enemy in his too precipitate flight, or to keep him at bay, they fired without leaving the saddle, for amid the immensity of the prairies man does not like to separate himself from his horse; if, however, it became necessary to attack an Indian camp or to defend a corral, if the enemy occupied a position too difficult of access, the dragoons, leaving their horses in charge of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of their number, formed and fought like infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Therefore, despite their awkward appearance and their long legs dangling by the sides of their little horses, despite their large wooden stirrups which they had brought from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and the weapons of every kind attached to their saddles, those bronze-faced men, with their sky-blue cloaks with fur collars, had the easy and resolute air which betokens the well-trained soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>From the manner in which they led their horses, it was easy to perceive that more than <num value="1">one</num> day's journey performed on foot by <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> the side of a limping animal had taught them to be merciful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>Let us say that they would have proved themselves ungrateful if they had failed to appreciate the good qualities of those faithful companions of their toils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>All those who have gone through a campaign in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> have often had occasion to admire the sagacity of the <rs>American</rs> horse and his sure footing in the middle of the darkest nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>Able, though small, to carry a great weight; gentle and intelligent, enduring fatigue, rain, cold, neglect, and want of food, he seemed in every way adapted for that rough life of the prairie which man could not face without his aid. In the evening, after a long day's march, his only meal would be the wild plants of the prairie in the midst of which the <hi rend="italics">bivouac</hi> had been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>But in the morning, instead of being saddled at sunrise, he was allowed to browse the herbage made tender by the heavy dews of the desert during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> of the day; and for every <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> march he was generally granted <num value="1">one</num> of rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>In short, when, after serving at this rate for many months, carrying both his master and his baggage, he re-entered the rude stable of the frontier post, he found means to regain strength and to forget his privations by munching ears of corn, the grains of which he picked out for himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The artillery had also a large share in the common hardships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>The mere changes of garrison between the distant posts, the defences of which it had charge, were equivalent at times to regular campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>It, moreover, made part of every important expedition, for the sound of cannon reverberating in the wilderness produces a profound impression upon the <rs>Indian</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The prairie, though passable for wagons, does not, however, much resemble a turnpike; the long marches over that rough ground, the crossing of rivers, the necessity of cutting a passage with the axe through the forests that are occasionally met with, kept both men and teams constantly at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Sometimes they were obliged to keep up with the pace of the cavalry, for the light expeditions undertaken by the latter were frequently accompanied by from <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="4">four</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>It is true that the artillery interfered but seldom, and only when the conflict was sufficiently equal to give it time to reach the field of battle, and when it was necessary to throw some shells into the midst of the mounted <rs>Indians</rs>, to make <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> up for the numerical inferiority of the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>But while waiting for this opportunity the gunners would take up the musket or the carbine, and, fighting either on foot or on horseback, share all the dangers of their companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Finally, the artillery officers found themselves frequently invested, either by choice or the chances of seniority, with the command of important expeditions; and they gave ample proof of having lost none of the traditions of the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, where we have seen them play such a brilliant part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>We have already mentioned the great scientific labors of the officers of the engineer and topographical <orgName n="Engineer Corps" type="corps">engineer corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>In the war-expeditions they occupied the post of honor, for they performed the functions of staff-officers and had charge of clearing the route for the army, and of directing its march.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>The administrative branches of the service had an important task to perform in those campaigns where it was necessary to prepare everything in advance that the army could require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>The reader will understand this when he recalls the fact of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0321.0003.00073.00144" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Sidney,,,:1"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> being followed by a train of <num value="4000">four thousand</num> wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>It is not astonishing, therefore, that when it became necessary to provide for a <num value="1000000">million</num> of volunteers, there should have been found among the various corps, quartermasters and commissaries of subsistence possessed of the required experience for directing every part of such a vast administration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>It was in the midst of this active and instructive life that the news of the disruption of the <rs>Union</rs> reached the <rs>American</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>The perfidious foresight of the late <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, <persName n="Floyd,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0003.00073.00145" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, had removed almost the whole of this army far from the <name>States</name> which his accomplices in the <rs>South</rs> were preparing to rise against the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The soldiers had been honored with the belief that they would remain faithful to their flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Under a multitude of pretexts the <rs>Federal</rs> forts and arsenals had been dismantled by the very men whose <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty was to watch over the general interests of the nation, and the garrisons which had been withdrawn from them, to be scattered over <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, had been placed under the command of an officer who seemed to have been only selected for the purpose of betraying them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>But thus removed from the haunts of civilization, the regular <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> officers had remained utter strangers to the turbulent quarrels which it engenders, and had paid but little attention to the movement which divided their country into <num value="2">two</num> hostile camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Consequently, no class of men suffered more keenly, when the citizens armed themselves against each other, than that military family whose members were united by so many ties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>All those belonging to the <rs>North</rs>, notwithstanding the great diversity of opinions on the questions of the day, prepared to respond to the appeal of their government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Among those who adhered to the <rs>Southern States</rs> on account of their birth or connections, there were some who, like the veteran <rs>Scott</rs>, remained faithful to their oath, believing that the insurrection, far from releasing them from it, obliged them to defend the threatened life of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The greatest portion of them, however, controlled by the influence of party spirit and imbued with the fatal doctrine of the absolute sovereignty of the <name>States</name>, which had come to be a kind of dogma among them, abandoned the <rs>Federal</rs> flag <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> to go and organize the infant forces of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Many among them did not adopt this course, so much at variance with the common notions of military honor, without regret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>These regrets, well known to their old comrades, contributed to mitigate the horrors of war, by removing from it all bitterness and passion; and their recollection actuated <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0321.0003.00074.00146" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> when, <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> later, he extended a friendly hand to his conquered adversary.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>Abandoned by a portion of their officers, destitute of resources, finding only enemies among the ungrateful population they had protected during so many years, these brave soldiers were further obliged to resist the flattering representations of those who promised them a brilliant future in the ranks of the insurgents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>She merely pretended to genealogical affinities to serve her own purpose, when, pointing to her old colony of New Orleans, she called herself half <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00076.00149" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>; and when, turning to the <rs>English</rs> aristocracy, she evoked the memory of the <name>Cavaliers</name> driven out by <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00076.00150" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, in order to array that aristocracy against the <rs>Yankees</rs>, whom she <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> represented as a gathering of Germans and Irishmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>In point of fact, the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00077.00151" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race ruled equally in the <rs>South</rs> and in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>It rapidly absorbed the races that had preceded it, as well as those which supplied it with a contingent of emigrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>In taking part in its work, those races also adopted its customs and its character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> city of the <rs>South</rs>, New Orleans, there did indeed exist a nucleus of population which by its language and associations clung to the country that had basely sold it. But that islet, already half submerged under the rising tide of another race, did not constitute a nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>As to the <name>Irish</name> emigrant, far from resisting this tide, he rather followed it; for although differing widely from the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00077.00152" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName>, he goes in search of a new country only where the latter is already firmly established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>He resembles those plants, difficult of acclimation, which only thrive upon a soil already prepared by other and more vigorous vegetation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>By another contradiction to his primitive habits, becoming in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> a denizen of cities rather than a tiller of the soil, the barriers which slavery had raised against the settling of husbandmen did not exist for him. Consequently, the <name>Irish</name> element had spread equally over the <rs>South</rs> and over the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>With that pliability of mind peculiar to the race, Irishmen adopted all the prejudices of those among whom they lived; and when the war broke out, they were seen to enlist in the cities of the <rs>South</rs>, where they were very numerous, with as much eagerness as their brethren living in the <rs>North</rs> displayed in defence of the <rs>Federal</rs> flag.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>No commercial interest separated the <rs>South</rs> from the aggregate interests of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Large rivers formed a single basin of all the centre of the continent, and all its products converged into the main artery of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, of which the <rs>Southern States</rs> held the lower course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Exclusively occupied with the culture of cotton and sugar-cane, they asked from the <rs>Western States</rs> meat and flour, which they could not produce in sufficient quantities for their own consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The <rs>North</rs> supplied them with the necessary capital for all their industrial enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>It is true that the <rs>South</rs> sought in these very circumstances a pretext for a new grief, by pretending to be the victim of speculation <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> on the part of those who brought her, together with their wealth, the means of fertilizing her soil; and when the day of secession came, all the debts contracted by the merchants and planters of the <rs>South</rs> toward Northern creditors, amounting, it is said, to <num value="1">one</num> billion of dollars, were repudiated, after the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> had tried in vain to confiscate them to its own benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>But this complaint, which is that of all countries in arrears against their more prosperous neighbors, cannot affect any serious mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>The complaints of Southern planters against the <rs>Northern States</rs> in regard to the protective tariffs, which favored the manufactures of the latter, were more plausible; but, in point of fact, they had no better foundation, for the <name>Morrill</name> tariff, the highest that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ever had, became a law under the administration of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0004.00078.00153" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, when the <rs>President</rs> and Congress were devoted to the interests of the <rs>South</rs>; and if they allowed that measure to pass, which they could have prevented, it is because they did not consider it dangerous to those interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>If the commercial question had had anything to do with the political struggle which brought on the civil war, the <rs>Western States</rs> would have had as much cause as those of the <rs>South</rs> to separate themselves from the manufacturing districts of New York, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, whose foundries and mills dread <name>English</name> competition, and they would have joined the <rs>South</rs> in defence of the system of free trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>The landholders of the <rs>West</rs>, in fact, also derived their wealth from the cultivation of the soil, the products of which were yearly exported in increasing quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>In spite of the scarcity of labor, the absence of land taxes, together with the cheapness and fertility of the land, afforded an outlet for their wheat to all the markets of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Commercial protection, therefore, which raised the price of all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> commodities for the benefit of their associates of the <rs>North</rs>&mdash;eastern States, was only a burden to them; and if, while complaining of this protection, they made common cause with those States, it is because they fully understood the sole motive of the war, and did not in any way deceive themselves as to the only social difference which divided America into <num value="2">two</num> hostile factions-<name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>This difference was not occasioned either by diversity of origin or by antagonistic commercial interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>It had a much deeper <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>It was a ditch dug between slavery and free labor, which was becoming wider every day. It was slavery, prosperous in <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the republic and abolished in the other, which had created in it <num value="2">two</num> hostile communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>It had greatly modified the customs of the <num value="1">one</num> where it was in the ascendant, while leaving the outward forms of government intact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>It was, indeed, not the pretext nor the occasion, but the sole cause of that antagonism, the inevitable consequence of which was the civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Therefore, in order to demonstrate the differences of character which the war revealed between the combatants, we must show the constant and fatal influence which the servile institution exercised over the habits, the ideas, and the tastes of those who lived in contact with it. Proteus-like, the question of slavery assumes every variety of form; it insinuates itself everywhere, and always reappears most formidable where <num value="1">one</num> least expects to encounter it. Notwithstanding all that has been said on the subject, our people, who fortunately have not had to wrestle with it, are not aware how much this subtle poison instils itself into the very marrow of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>It was, in fact, in the name of the rights of the oppressed race that they condemned slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>It was the sentiment of justice in behalf of this race which inspired religions <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> when, in response to the appeals of <persName n="Buxton,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00079.00154" reg="mostcommon:Buxton,nomatch:0"><surname>Buxton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wilberforce,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00079.00155" reg="mostcommon:Wilberforce,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilberforce</surname></persName>, she proclaimed emancipation; and which actuated our great <orgName n="National Assembly" type="assembly">National Assembly</orgName> when it abolished slavery for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in our colonies, and those who again prepared for its suppression after the extraordinary act by which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Consul re-established it upon <name>French</name> soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>It was the picture of the unmerited sufferings of our fellow-beings which stirred up the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> at the perusal of that romance, so simple and yet so eloquent, called <hi rend="italics"><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s Cabin</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>But the effects of the servile institution upon the dominant race present a spectacle not less sad and instructive to the historian and philosopher; for a fatal demoralization is the just punishment that slavery inflicts upon those who expect to find nothing in it but profit and power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>In order to demonstrate more clearly to what extent this demoralization is the inevitable consequence of slavery, and how, by an inexorable logic, the simple fact of the enslavement of the <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> black corrupts, among the whites, the ideas and morals which are the very foundation of society, we will pass over the long martyrdom of bad treatment daily inflicted by brutal masters upon their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>It is among those who before the war were called good slave-owners that we must inquire into the pretended moral perfection of slavery, in order to understand all its flagrant immorality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>This slave-owner possesses the same principles as ourselves, but he is obliged to obey the laws of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>He knows what protection and respect are due to the family tie; but as the negro population in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, employed in the cultivation of the cotton and sugar, does not multiply fast enough to supply the exigencies of this kind of labor, he goes into the markets of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to procure a contingent of young laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>After having thus torn them from their relatives, their affections, and the land of their birth, he will certainly not break up the new ties that are forming under his own eyes; but this is owing to the fact that, as an economical manager, he finds in their fecundity a direct source of revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>He does not desire to humiliate, to cause suffering by unnecessary castigations, but the negro who fails to perform his duties must be punished, and these duties are obedience and labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>The negro must forget that he is a man &mdash;to remember only that he is a slave, and to work without choice of occupation, without remuneration, without hope of a better future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>In short, his owner will take care of him, will not impose any labor above his strength, and will administer to his material wants in a satisfactory manner, precisely as he will do for the animals that are working by his side under <num value="1">one</num> common lash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>But, in order that he may enjoy this pretended good fortune, he has to be reduced to the moral level of his fellow-slaves, and have the light of intelligence within him extinguished for ever; for if he carries that divine spark in his bosom, he will be unhappy, for he will feel that he is a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>And when the good master, satisfied with his own virtues, points to his slaves, saying, <q direct="unspecified">They are happy; they have no care for the morrow; they are lodged, fed, and clothed, and would not accept their freedom,</q> it is the bitterest of self-accusations, for it is the same as if he said, <q direct="unspecified">I have so completely stifled in them every feeling that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has implanted in the heart of man, that the word freedom, which we <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> might hear pronounced by every creature that has breath, if we understood all the languages of Nature, has no longer any meaning for them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>It might so happen, in extreme cases, that even in the midst of his surroundings, his conscience rebels against this degradation of his fellow-beings, but then he will blame the customs which sanction this systematic degradation, and the severe and peculiar laws, enacted in almost all the <rs>Southern States</rs>, which render it nearly impossible for him to grant individual emancipation, and which even subject him to severe penalties if he should teach his own negroes to read and write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Shall he protest against this hateful law which confines the intelligence of the slave within the narrow dungeon of perpetual ignorance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>He cannot do so, because the moral degradation of the latter is the only guarantee for his physical submission: if he were to witness too frequently the liberation of his fellow-beings from bondage as an act of favor, he would wish for it in his turn; and if he received the least education, he would rise in his own estimation, the abyss which separates him from his master would appear less difficult to cross, and he would emerge satisfied from the brutal condition in which it is necessary to keep him in order to make him the docile instrument of a lucrative traffic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>But, again, the servile institution, in violating the supreme law of humanity, which links indissolubly together those <num value="2">two</num> words, labor and progress, and in making labor itself a means for brutalizing man, not only degraded the slave, but it also engendered depravity in the master; for the despotism of a whole race, like the absolute power of a single individual, or an oligarchy, always ends by disturbing the reason and the moral sense of those who have once inhaled its intoxicating fragrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>Nothing was more calculated to develop this kind of depravity than the high qualities, and the virtues even, which existed in the community founded upon such a despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>It is precisely because that community was enlightened and religious, because it had produced men, in every other respect, of irreproachable character, because it had given birth to heroic soldiers who had followed a Lee and a Jackson to the battle-field, that it was the more revolting to see slavery, with its odious consequences, prosper in its midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>That this community should have exhibited such a shocking contrast <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> to the world without being itself conscious of the fact, the moral sense must have been perverted in the child, surrounded from its birth by flattering slaves; in the man, absolute master of the labor of his fellow-beings; in the woman, accustomed to relieve the distress around her, in obedience, not to the dictates of duty, but to a mere instinct of humanity and pity; in everybody, in short, through the exaggerations of declamatory appeals intended to stifle the voice of upright consciences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>What a deeply sorrowful spectacle for any <num value="1">one</num> who wishes to study human nature to see every sense of righteousness and equity so far perverted in a whole population by the force of habit, that the greatest portion of the ministers of all denominations were not ashamed to sully Christianity by a cowardly approval of slavery; and men who bought and sold their fellow-beings took up arms for the express purpose of defending this odious privilege, in the name of liberty and property!<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>This falsehood having become the basis of society, its influence increased and gathered strength from prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>The founders of the <rs>American</rs> nation regarded slavery as a social sore, and trusted to the enlightenment and patriotism of their successors to heal it; but as this institution was productive of considerable profit, it was soon viewed in a different light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>The Middle States (<placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>) were ready to abolish it, in imitation of their neighbors of the <rs>North</rs>, when the suppression of the slave trade gave a new impulse to slave production among them, by protecting it against the competition of negro-traders, who formerly brought cargoes of slaves from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 7" reg="africa">Guinea</placeName> under the name of <hi rend="italics">ebony</hi>. They soon developed this new branch of industry; and the planters of the <rs>South</rs>, being always able to procure fresh and hardy laborers in their own markets, found it economical to spare their slaves no longer, but to subject them to excessive labor which wore them out in a few years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>This abundance of hands giving an extraordinary impulse to the cultivation of the sugar-cane and the cotton-plant, slavery, which the authors of the <rs>American Constitution</rs> had not even dared to mention by name, was thenceforth honored, recognized, and considered as the corner-stone of the social edifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/><pb id="p.83" n="83"/></p> 
<p>But the upholders of slavery did not stop here; after having declared it to be profitable and necessary, they proceeded to proclaim its moral excellence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>A <orgName n="New School" type="school">new school</orgName>, of which <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00083.00156" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> was the principal apostle, the teachings of which were accepted by all the statesmen of the <rs>South</rs>, assumed the mission of holding up the social system founded upon slavery as the highest state of perfection that modern civilization had reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>It was to this system that <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> was destined to belong, and its adherents anticipated for it the empire of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>There was a time when these frightful dreams cast a sinister light upon the future of the new continent, for it seemed as if their realization was within the scope of possibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>In fact, the slave-power could only exist by enlarging its domain and absorbing everything around it. Reckless and violent in its modes of proceeding, compelling the <rs>Union</rs> to become the docile instrument of its policy, it had conquered immense territories in the interest of servitude, sometimes in the wilderness, more frequently in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> or among the <rs>Northern</rs> settlements, and it already extended its hand towards <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> and the isthmus of <placeName key="tgn,7005562" n="1.000 9" reg="nicaragua">Nicaragua</placeName>&mdash;positions selected with the instinct of control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>If the <rs>North</rs> had carried patience and forbearance much further, the day when the decisive crisis arrived, this power might possibly have been able to impose its fatal yoke upon all <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>In proportion as slavery thus increased in prosperity and power, its influence became more and more preponderant in the community which had adopted it. Like a parasitical plant which, drawing to itself all the sap of the most vigorous tree, covers it gradually with a foreign verdure and poisonous fruits, so slavery was impairing the morals of the <rs>South</rs>, and the spirit of her institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>The forms of liberty existed, the press seemed to be free, the deliberations of legislative bodies were tumultuous, and every man boasted of his independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>But the spirit of true liberty, tolerance towards the minority, and respect for individual opinion, had departed, and those deceitful appearances concealed the despotism of an inexorable master, slavery&mdash;a master before whom the most powerful of slaveholders was himself but a slave, as abject as the meanest of his laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>No <num value="1">one</num> had a right to question its legitimacy, and like the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Eumenides,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00083.00157" reg="mostcommon:Eumenides,nomatch:0"><surname>Eumenides</surname></persName></hi>, which the ancients <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> feared to offend by naming them, so wherever the slave power was in the ascendant, people did not even dare to mention its name, for fear of touching upon too dangerous a subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>It was on this condition only that such an institution could maintain itself in a prosperous and intelligent community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>It would have perished on the very day when the people should be at liberty to discuss it. Therefore, notwithstanding their boasted love of freedom, the people of the <rs>South</rs> did not hesitate to commit any violence in order to crush out, in its incipiency, any attempt to discuss the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> who had ventured to cast the slightest reflection upon the slavery system could not have continued to live in the <rs>South</rs>; it was sufficient to point the finger at any stranger and call him an abolitionist to consign him at once to the fury of the populace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>In short, the mere fact that a simple <orgName n="Kansas Farmer" type="newspaper">Kansas farmer</orgName> named <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0321.0004.00084.00160" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, who had been ruined and persecuted by the slaveholders, sought to wreak his revenge upon them in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and had gathered together a dozen of fugitive slaves at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, was sufficient to arouse a terrible sensation in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>It was thought that a civil war had broken out, preparations were made for a great uprising, and it was found necessary to send regular troops from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to seize this man, who expiated upon the gallows the crime of having frightened the proud <rs>Virginians</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>It was not enough, however, thus to protect slavery on its own domain; the acknowledgment of its supremacy had to be enforced in all the neighboring States in order to protect it from all outward attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The <rs>North</rs>, through an imprudent exercise of the spirit of conciliation, had allowed the <rs>Constitution</rs> to be violated <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> by shameful compromises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>The barriers of the free States had been lowered that the fugitive slave might be restored to the planter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>The national policy was entirely subservient to the interests of the slave-power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Its demands, in short, became the more pressing and excessive that it felt itself on the point of losing the control of that policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>It could permit neither the territorial extension of the <rs>North</rs> nor the criticisms of a free press beyond its boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Therefore, it was fully determined not to give up its supremacy in the councils of the <rs>Union</rs> without a struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Its newspapers and orators inflamed the public mind, and prepared it for the coming conflict; prophetic romances, so called, shadowed forth the triumphs it would achieve; and, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appeal of the secession leaders, the whole Southern community, seized with a raging fever, severed without the least regret all the ties which the day before had bound it to those whom it thought to insult by styling them abolitionists.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>The differences which slavery had engendered between the <rs>South</rs> and the <rs>North</rs> were not confined to this political antagonism; they affected the very constitution of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Under its influence there had sprung up in the <rs>South</rs> classes more and more widely separated from each other&mdash;a division which greatly facilitated at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> its military organization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Work, being considered an act of servitude, could not be resorted to without disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>This rule, enforced by public opinion, kept out of the <rs>Southern</rs> territories that immense tide of emigrants from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and the <rs>Eastern States</rs> which spreads over the vast prairies of the <rs>West</rs>, to form a population of landholders working their own farms&mdash;a population whose industry, energy, and intelligence constitute the strength and respectability of the <hi rend="italics">freesoil States</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>The social system of the <rs>South</rs> was founded upon large domains, <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> the inconveniences of which are especially felt in a region of country yet half wild, but which were the inevitable result of the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>It alone, in fact, admitted of turning to advantage the expensive, insufficient, and uncertain labor of the slave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>This labor is costly, for the profits accruing from it must not only cover the maintenance of the slave during his lifetime, but also the interest on, and the redemption in a few years of, the capital invested in his purchase; and the amount of these costs being always in excess of the yearly wages paid to the best white laborer, the employment of free labor is, all things considered, the most economical.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>It is insufficient, because, the intelligence of the slave being systematically suppressed, his work is always clumsy, and the same care cannot be expected from him as from the laborer who is master of himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>It is uncertain, because the harvest season requires a great number of hands which the proprietor is unable to hire in a free market; and he is therefore obliged to maintain upon his plantation throughout the year the number of slaves he may then require, without being able, by any amount of foresight, to make an exact calculation in advance; having, moreover, to take all the chances of sickness and stoppage of work, among his best laborers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>Under such circumstances the cultivation of the land could only be undertaken on a large scale and with considerable capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>On the large plantations, the absence of those resources afforded by free competition could be supplied by having special slaves taught different trades, and the variety of labor required by such operations always admitted of the employment of a large portion of the slaves-sometimes upon <num value="1">one</num> kind of work, sometimes upon another; in short, the capital invested was divided among a sufficient number of negroes to enable the proprietor, by means of a <orgName n="Sinking Fund" type="fund">sinking fund</orgName> and an insurance system well managed, to meet the accidents which are the ruin of small slaveholders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>Owing to this peculiar condition of landed property, the <rs>Southern States</rs> were almost exclusively occupied by <num value="3">three</num> classes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>At the foot of the social ladder was the negro, bowed down upon the soil he alone had to cultivate, forming a population of <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> about <num value="4000000">four million</num> souls&mdash;that is to say, <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the inhabitants of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>At the top, the masters, too numerous to constitute an aristocracy, yet forming, nevertheless, a real caste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>They owned the land and the slaves who cultivated it; and each of them living in the midst of an entirely servile population whose labor was under their control, they disdained every other kind of occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>Consequently, being more intelligent than educated, brave but irascible, proud but overbearing, eloquent but intolerant, they devoted themselves to public affairs&mdash;the exclusive direction of which belonged to them&mdash;with all the ardor of their temperament.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class&mdash;that of common whites, the most important on account of its numbers&mdash;occupied a position below the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and far above the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, without, however, forming an intermediate link between them, for it was deeply imbued with all the prejudices of color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>This was the <hi rend="italics">plebs romana</hi>, the crowds of clients who parade with ostentation the title of citizen, and only exercise its privileges in blind subserviency to the great slaveholders, who were the real masters of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>If slavery had not existed in their midst, they would have been workers and tillers of the soil, and might have become farmers and small proprietors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>But the more their poverty draws them nearer to the inferior class of slaves, the more anxious are they to keep apart from them, and they spurn work in order to set off more ostentatiously their quality of free men. This unclassified population, wretched and restless, supplied Southern policy with the fighting vanguard which preceded the planter's invasion of the <rs>West</rs> with his slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>At the beginning of the war the <rs>North</rs> believed that this class would join her in condemnation of the servile institution, whose ruinous competition it ought to have detested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>But the <rs>North</rs> was mistaken in thinking that reason would overcome its prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>It showed, on the contrary, that it was ardently devoted to the maintenance of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Its pride was even more at stake than that of the great slaveholders; for, while the latter were always sure of remaining in a position far above the freed negroes, the former feared lest their emancipation should disgrace the middle white classes by raising the blacks to their level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/><pb id="p.88" n="88"/></p> 
<p>This division of classes facilitated the organization of the forces of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>Each of them had its part in the drama laid out, and the transition from a state of peace to <num value="1">one</num> of war was effected with so little trouble, that the very ease with which it was accomplished proved to be a dangerous temptation, which contributed to drag the <rs>South</rs> into the fatal path where it was destined to find defeat and ruin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>The negroes naturally remained attached to the soil, and by continuing their forced labors, they saved the agricultural interests of the <rs>South</rs> from those serious troubles which the preparations for war inflicted upon those of the <rs>North</rs>, and thereby sustained the cause of those who riveted their chains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>While at the <rs>North</rs> every soldier who donned the uniform left some employment useful to society, in the <rs>South</rs> the truly productive population never ceased for a moment to contribute to the common wants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>The common white people, who, doomed to idleness on account of their social position, had never contributed to the national wealth in a manner proportionate to their number, willingly exchanged the leisure of their poverty for the occupations of military life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>They constituted the principal element of the <rs>Southern</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Useless and dangerous in a well-regulated community, they were fully prepared for this new role.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>Habituated to the privations of a precarious existence, accustomed from infancy to handling arms, which they considered a sign of nobility, zealous in defending the privileges and the superiority of their race, they could not fail to become formidable soldiers if placed under able leaders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>They found these leaders among the superior class of slaveholders, from whom they were already accustomed to receive directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>Therefore, although grades of every description were made elective, the new soldiers, faithful to their habits, almost invariably selected members of this superior class to command them; and if any slaveholders, during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> outbursts of enthusiasm, set them the example by shouldering the musket, none of them ever remained in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>It followed that the fatal system of electing officers was not productive of the same evil <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> effects in the <rs>South</rs> as in the <rs>North</rs>, and was continued much longer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>We have not, as yet, spoken of the population of the cities, because it had not felt so directly the effects of the servile institution as those living in the country, and because, moreover, it was too small to exercise much influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>Much inferior to the slaveholders, but superior to the common whites, this population was recruited from among the latter class and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> emigrants, especially the <name>Irish</name>, who seldom get beyond the walls of American cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Therefore, although noisily in favor of the slave-system, they did not look upon it as the very basis of society, nor did they defend the institution with as much zeal as did the whites who lived in the country in the midst of negro laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had but <num value="1">one</num> city, New Orleans, which could rival the great cities of the <rs>North</rs>, and only <num value="2">two</num> others, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> political centres of secession, with a population of more than <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>Among these there were negro slaves, and free mulattoes, a pretty large class exclusively devoted to city life, and the more hostile to the whites because it was more intelligent, and the ban under which it lay was less justified by the color of its skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>The white population of the cities could not be estimated at more than <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> souls.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>When, therefore, the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders, beaten at the elections, were about to resort to arms in order to re-establish the supremacy of slavery among them, public opinion, long prepared for the occasion, was ready to applaud their action and to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> their efforts with energy; while the various classes of society tendered them all the necessary means for speedily organizing their armies. </p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/><emph>W</emph>E have shown how the influence of slavery, which dragged the <rs>Southern States</rs> into civil war, had also created certain classes among them ready to furnish all the elements of an army, the organization of which had long been in contemplation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>Consequently, while the <rs>North</rs> was sincerely trying to effect some kind of political compromise, companies of volunteers were seen assembling and arming in haste throughout the whole of the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>Their minds were bent upon war, and they went to work with the greatest energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>The zeal of the women stimulated that of the men; and in that population, essentially indolent, whoever hesitated to don the uniform was set down as a coward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>The planters, being at all times in dread of servile insurrections, had given to the local militia an effective organization which it did not have in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>They had <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi> sufficiently trained and instructed to receive volunteers at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>Finally, the <orgName n="West Point Academy" type="academy">West Point Academy</orgName> and the military-colleges founded by several States had contributed to disseminate a knowledge of military affairs among the better classes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>The volunteers who took up arms at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> signal of their leaders did not wait for the announcement of the act of separation to assemble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>In the border States, where, public opinion being divided, the <rs>Federal</rs> authority was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> able to sustain itself in the midst of the political convulsion, the future soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> met and organized under the very eyes of its agents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>Wherever the pro-slavery element, essentially intolerant, was in the majority, it exercised the same despotism over the minority that its leaders imposed upon it. Those who regretted the national flag, who questioned the constitutionality of the principle <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> which had been invoked to justify the separation, or who did not consider its application well timed, were reduced to silence; and even this silence soon ceased to give satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>As it happens in all revolutions, professions of devotion to the new order of things were exacted from those who were suspected of lukewarmness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Among the <rs>Northern</rs> men settled in the <rs>South</rs>, some embraced the cause of slavery with the ardor of neophytes, but those who did not atone for the crime of having been born in .the free States, by this method, became the victims of popular hatred and violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>In the South-western States, where the manners are rough, they were subjected to downright persecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>In each of the growing centres of civilization, where farmers came from afar across the forests to attend to their political and commercial affairs, vigilance committees were formed, composed of men who had been conspicuous for their excesses during the electoral struggles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>Assuming unlimited power without authority, they united in themselves the attributes of a <orgName n="Public Safety Committee" type="committee">committee of public safety</orgName> with the functions of a revolutionary tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>The bar-room was generally the place of their meetings, and a revolting parody of the august forms of justice was mingled with their noisy orgies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Around the counter, on which gin and whisky circulated freely, a few frantic individuals pronounced judgment upon their fellow-citizens, whether present or absent; the accused saw the fatal rope being made ready even before he had been interrogated; the person in contumacy was only informed of his sentence when he fell by the bullet of the executioner, stationed behind a bush for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Personal animosities were at the bottom of the greater part of these decrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>In order to punish the workman or the settler from the <rs>North</rs> for his intelligence and success, his envious neighbors called him an abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>If some courageous friend did not answer for his admiring approval of slavery, he was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>At times, however, the fumes of alcohol, mounting to the heads of the judges, would enkindle quarrels between them, soon ending in bloodshed, in the midst of which both the trial and the accused were equally forgotten.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>But if the latter was spared his life, it was only that he might devote it to the service of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>He was to consider <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> himself fortunate in being able to prove his devotion, without which he would have deserved death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>He therefore went to enlist as a <hi rend="italics">volunteer</hi> at the nearest recruiting-office; and, by a bitter irony of fortune, he would sometimes find himself enrolled in some such regiment as the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> Tigers</hi> or the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> Invincibles</hi>, names in singular contrast with his gloomy thoughts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>A few executions and a considerable number of forced enlistments sufficed to crush out every expression of Union sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>Vigilance committees were formed in all the <rs>Southern States</rs>; and if they did not everywhere proceed to the extremes of violence, they everywhere trampled under foot all public and individual liberties, by resorting to search-warrants and other vexatious proceedings, which, by intimidating the weak and stimulating the irresolute, contributed to fill up the <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi> of the volunteer regiments rapidly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>The burden of the war was to fall exclusively upon the white population of those States which at the commencement of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> had set aside the <rs>Federal</rs> authority; this population, according to the census of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, amounted to <num value="5449463">5,449,463</num> souls&mdash;or nearly <num value="5000000.5">five millions and a half</num>&mdash;out of which <num value="690000">number 690,000</num> men able to bear arms were to be raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>This last figure represents the total of all the forces that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was at any time able to command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>Owing to the social causes we have mentioned, and the conviction of every person who played a decided part, there were enlisted in the course of the year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> nearly <num value="350000">350,000</num> men; that is to say, more than <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the adult and eligible male population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>This <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effort of the <rs>South</rs> was, in proportion to her resources, much greater than that of the <rs>North</rs>; and the military power she displayed so rapidly, added to all the advantages of a defensive position, could not fail to give her a superiority at the outset of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>But while the <rs>North</rs>, slow in making use of her resources, found in every disaster the occasion for increasing her army, which, by this means, was at the close of the war twice as large as it was at the beginning, the <rs>South</rs> was not in a condition to sustain the extraordinary effort she had made at the outset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>Notwithstanding the idleness of her white population, which favored the adoption of military service, it was found necessary to resort to conscription <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> as soon as the conflicts had thinned the ranks of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enlisted volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>The longer the war is continued, the more we shall find the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> resorting to all sorts of violent expedients in order to drain an already exhausted country of the little strength it yet possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>The despotic system which had so rapidly brought all its resources into operation will then have no other effect than to destroy irretrievably whatever is left; and if it compel all able-bodied men to don the uniform, it will not prevent <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the surviving soldiers from deserting their ranks at the end of the war, to return secretly to their homes, or to seek liberty among the forests.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>At this period of intoxication which precipitated them into civil war, nothing could convince the men of the <rs>South</rs> of the fragility of their new political edifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>Although used to biblical citations, they had forgotten the history of that miraculous tree which grew up in <num value="1">one</num> night to shield the prophet <rs>Jonah</rs>, but which the sting of an invisible worm destroyed as rapidly within the space of a single day. Their Confederacy had grown in the same way, and they already saw it spreading its shadow over the whole of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, little dreaming that it also bore within its roots a gnawing worm, slavery, and that its institutions, founded upon despotism and contempt for humanity, would be withered by the burning blast of civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Everything was the subject of illusions in the <rs>South</rs>&mdash;illusions concerning the weakness of her adversary, illusions in regard to her own perseverance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>Accustomed to look upon Northern men, the <rs>Yankees</rs>, as peaceful merchants, the caste which had arrogated to itself the title of Southern chivalry would not believe that they could ever become soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>The grossest calumnies circulated by the newspapers about them remained uncontradicted, and after having been so long connected in politics as well as in business with their brethren of the <rs>North</rs>, the people of the <rs>South</rs> were absolutely ignorant of the resources of their character and their manly qualities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>It is true that they did not possess a better knowledge of themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>The inflammatory speeches of their stump orators, called in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> <hi rend="italics">fire-eaters</hi>, although usually appreciated by the good sense of the public, had, in this instance, over-excited the passions <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> of the multitude, and only reflected what the majority thought and what every <num value="1">one</num> said.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>No <num value="1">one</num> was doubtful of success; everybody was convinced that, despite all the obstinacy of which the <rs>Yankees</rs> were capable, the independence of the <rs>South</rs> would eventually be secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>No efforts would be spared to wear out the enemy and compel him to recognize it. If the organized armies should be destroyed, guerilla bands would be formed, which, hoisting the black flag and giving no quarter, should perpetuate the war through every available means, and fight as long as they could handle a knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Events were destined to frustrate, in the most striking manner, these projects of war to the death; instead of sheltering guerillas, as we have already stated, the virgin forests only became the refuge of deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>But the illusions which inspired the people of the <rs>South</rs> with such blind confidence were sincere; the harsh condemnation of history must be reserved for the leaders who flattered them, who kept up those illusions, and who were yet top well acquainted with the character of their countrymen, and saw too clearly the consequences of a defeat, to share them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>The volunteers repaired to the recruiting-offices which had been opened by the initiative action of the most zealous and ambitious persons in every district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>The formation of regiments which were thus spontaneously called into existence throughout the <rs>Southern States</rs> was generally the private work of a few individuals, associated together for that purpose in their respective villages or quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/><num value="1">One</num> would collect a squad, another a company; parish associations, <hi rend="italics">coteries</hi>, and individual influence constituted the early ties among the soldiers thus recruited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>The different detachments, once assembled, were grouped by counties or by towns to be formed into regiments; all the higher grades were conferred, by election, upon those who by their birth, wealth, or recent services in the matter of enlistments were thought to be entitled to the choice of their future subordinates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>This <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organization, an entirely spontaneous creation of the national movement, often preceded the legal call for volunteers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Presently, the governors of States intervened for the purpose of regulating the organization, by fixing the number of men to be raised and the quota of each county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>The legislatures of the <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> States that had just voted in favor of separation confirmed the action of the governors by authorizing the necessary appropriations for the support of the troops destined to sustain their rebellion against the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>The regiments were then mustered into the service of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The officers already elected were confirmed in their respective grades; brigades were formed, to which staff officers were assigned; a large number of generals were appointed, and the particular army of each State found itself thus constituted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>This organization by States, in conformity with the principle of their independence, would have been kept up in the new Confederacy, if the principle itself had been the cause, and not the mere pretext, of the war. But although useful at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it proved subsequently to be only an encumbrance to the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders, who hastened to get rid of it. In order to succeed, they needed a despotic central power, capable of pushing the war to extremes, whose iron hand should be able to supply the want of popular enthusiasm when, as was to be expected, it should become weary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Such was the dominant idea of the delegates who established a provisional government at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, a small town in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>In confiding the executive power to <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0004.00095.00161" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, who had been the soul of the rebellion, they united into <num value="1">one</num> solid whole the scattered forces of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>While they inserted in their frail constitution a guarantee for all their new constitutional theories, they practically tightened the bonds of centralization; and deferring the fulfilment of their promises, which were all destined to be blown away by the same puff of wind, to a more auspicious season, they hastened to give the absolute control of all their resources to the pilot who was to guide the skiff, upon which they had rashly embarked their fortunes, through the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>Consequently, without wasting time in the preparation of organic laws, of which it knew the weakness, the provisional government devoted all its attention to the consolidation of the military forces of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>It was well aware of the necessity of making preparations for a serious war, and, in view of that fact, of embodying all the independent regiments it had under its control into <num value="1">one</num> homogeneous army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>Congress had hardly assembled, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> only <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> counting <num value="7">seven</num> stars on its new escutcheon, when it assisted <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0004.00096.00162" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> in this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>It entrusted him with the supreme management of military operations, with authority to muster into the service of the central government the volunteers of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>On the <dateStruct value="1861-03-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> the number of these volunteers was fixed at <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num>, and their term of enlistment for <num value="1">one</num> year, and, at the same time, orders were issued directing the formation of a <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> for the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName>, and the organization of a regular army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>The <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName> was to be reorganized as soon as the adopted Constitution should be put in force, and it was decided that all the <rs>State</rs> troops of which it was composed should then be re-enlisted in the service of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for a period fixed by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Contrary to what had hitherto been the practice in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, where the <rs>Federal</rs> compact vested the right of maintaining troops in time of peace exclusively in the central authority, there were seen, among the particular contingents of the several States, what were called regular troops, intended to be kept in service after the end of the war and the recognition of their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>But in the mean time, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> took them into its service and pay, and provided them with staff officers and administrative departments, either by appointing new officers or by confirming the appointments already made by the governors of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>In both cases these officers held their commissions from the <rs>President</rs>, and retained them during the entire war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>In this matter the men of the <rs>South</rs>, true to American customs and traditions, took for their model the levies of other periods, especially those of the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, under the <orgName n="Union Flag" type="newspaper">Union flag</orgName>; and their organization was precisely the same as that of the armies of the <rs>North</rs>, of which we shall speak more at length hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>The habits, the modes of thought and of action were so similar throughout every section of the republic that, in spite of their desire to be considered a separate nation, the people of the <rs>South</rs> could not disclaim the traditions they held in common with their brethren of the <rs>North</rs>, to preserve a distinct character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>When they sought to enact laws <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> for themselves, they took the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, and altered the sense, without modifying its form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>They selected for their new flag that which most resembled the banner of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Finally, in their efforts to raise volunteers, and to organize the interior mechanism of their armies, they scrupulously preserved and applied the system which had prevailed before secession, and which we shall see put into practice by the <rs>North</rs> on a very large scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>They pursued this course so far as to organize a corps of regular troops, independent of the authority of so-called sovereign States, and they copied the old <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">army of the United States</orgName> so exactly that they limited its strength to the insignificant figure of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men. But this army, unable to compensate for its numerical weakness either by its traditions or the elements that composed it, was not in any way distinguished from the other Confederate troops, and had no special part to play in the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>Never, perhaps, since the time of <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00097.00163" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>, could the sad words of <persName n="Lucan,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00097.00164" reg="mostcommon:Lucan,nomatch:0"><surname>Lucan</surname></persName> have been applied with so much truth to any civil war as to this <num value="1">one</num>:</p> <lg> <l><hi rend="italics">Pares aquilas et pila minantia pilis</hi>.</l></lg> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>This war, however, developed important differences of character between men composing armies so similar in their organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>Those of the <rs>South</rs> became good soldiers more rapidly than those of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>They were more accustomed to follow leaders; their life was rougher than that of the <rs>Eastern</rs> farmers, and more adventurous than that of the <rs>Western</rs> pioneers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Inured to privations, they were satisfied with rations which the <rs>Federal</rs> soldier looked upon as insufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Hence that rapidity of movement which was <num value="1">one</num> of the principal causes of all their successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Rarely paid by the government, which, unable to solve its financial difficulties, fairly ignored their claims, they never asked for the depreciated paper which was due to them, except when they thought their officers better treated than themselves, and then it was sufficient to lead them against the foe to pacify them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Nearly all of them were practiced in the use of fireams, and <num value="1">one</num> might see them enter the recruiting-offices with the rifle on their shoulders and the revolver at the belt&mdash;weapons which they never laid aside, and without which they would not have considered themselves <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>In fine, they carried into the war more passion than their adversaries; the <rs>Federals</rs> to them were invaders who had always been painted in the blackest colors, and who, in coming to free the negroes, intended to make them the equals of the common whites, and consequently to humble the jealous caste to which those whites belonged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>On the other hand, the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier was inferior, in point of intelligence and information, to that of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>Southern society being divided into very distinct classes, the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;lite</hi> of the population only were cultivated; the rest had no education whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>While primary schools were universal in the <rs>North</rs>, profound ignorance reigned among most of the inhabitants of the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>This difference, which the census tables of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> exhibit in a striking manner, had a great bearing on the issues of the conflict; for the nations that are really strong are not those which possess a few distinguished men, but those in which the moral and intellectual standard of the greatest number is most elevated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>In the knapsacks of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers there were found more playing-cards than books or writing materials, while the use of strong drinks was much more prevalent among them than among those of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>Whether this vice was more congenial to their tastes, or whether it was deemed expedient to tolerate it as a kind of compensation for all their privations, the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers were unable strictly to enforce the rules which prohibited the use of spirituous liquors among their troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>Nor did the <rs>Southern</rs> armies have in their ranks any of those artisans skilled in all the mechanical trades that were to be found in the armies of the <rs>North</rs>, whose craft enabled every Federal regiment to supply the necessary men for the reconstruction of railroads, the repairing of locomotives, or for running a train; so that the <rs>Confederates</rs> were more than once under the necessity of applying to Northern men, forcibly enlisted, for this kind of service, or of confiding the task to their own officers, whose inexperience cost them dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>To the common whites, in short, taught to despise every kind of manual labor, the soldier's trade was, what used to be called formerly, a noble profession, and they felt degraded when called upon to handle the shovel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>They often refused to work in those trenches which played such a conspicuous part <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> during the war. A few requisitions for negro help made upon the large slaveholders supplied this want, and, by sparing the free men a certain amount of hard work, enabled them to devote more time to their military training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>They were not, however, relieved entirely from these labors; the authority of their chiefs succeeded in conquering their repugnance, and in cases of great urgency they constructed with their own hands the works which indicate to this day the progress of their campaigns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>The character of the soldiers and the composition of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> had much to do with the manner in which the war was waged by the latter, and the part which the various arms played in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>The Confederate foot-soldier, easier to manage and more excitable than his adversary, would rush to the charge with savage yells, and, in this way, he frequently carried positions which the latter, with equal courage, could not have captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>But on the other hand, possessing neither his patience nor his tenacity under a murderous fire, he was much less able to defend them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>So that, in the course of the war, we shall always find the <rs>Southern</rs> officers trying to surprise some point or another of the <rs>Federal</rs> lines with heavy masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>This infantry, which would not have cut a very brilliant figure at a review by the precision of its movements, possessed the art of marching through the densest forests in good order, deployed in such a manner as to avoid trees, and yet without becoming separated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>This art rendered those surprises easy of achievement, by enabling a body of infantry to hide within the depths of the forest without being preceded by any line of skirmishers, and to approach the enemy with sufficient rapidity to attack him suddenly in the clearing where he was encamped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>The history of the war will show how useful this kind of tactics was to the <rs>Confederate</rs> generals&mdash;how they availed themselves of it to compel the enemy to extend his lines so as to cover all his positions at once; in this manner they frequently obtained advantages upon the point of attack with inferior forces; and if their columns were repulsed, they were quickly withdrawn and led elsewhere to attack some other position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>We shall also find, however, that they did not apply these tactics to advantage when they found themselves among the unwooded hills <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>; there they could not avail themselves of the skill of their soldiers by deploying them as sharpshooters to cover their attacks against open positions defended by artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>These soldiers, more practiced in the use of the rifle than those of the <rs>North</rs>, were well adapted for such service; they proved this during the sieges and those slow operations where the <num value="2">two</num> armies, after having both fallen back into their respective entrenchments, reconnoitred each other in turn, and drew their lines closer by degrees without daring to charge each other openly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>Posted behind breastworks, or in a rifle-pit, they would watch the <rs>Federal</rs> works with the cool vigilance of a hunter who has passed many days motionless by the side of some deserted lake, watching for the stag that is sure to come to quench his thirst at sunset; and it only required to place a hat on the point of a bayonet and raise it slowly above the <rs>Federal</rs> parapets to see all the bushes, which seemed to have been innocently planted in front of the enemy's line, enveloped in smoke, and that improvised target pierced by as many balls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaigns, the habits and education of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers gave to their cavalry a still more marked superiority over that of their adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>This superiority was wrongly attributed to the merit of the chiefs who commanded it; for if <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00100.00165" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,nomatch:0"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00100.00166" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, and all those brilliant officers who organized the cavalry of the <rs>South</rs> won at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the respect and admiration of their enemies, they found in front of them generals equally expert in the art of handling that arm of the military service: <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00100.00167" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00100.00168" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>, <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00100.00169" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>, and many others demonstrated this as soon as they had good troops to command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>The severe discipline which had been introduced into the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> was the means of moulding those cavalrymen to the difficult task they had to accomplish; but their superiority was chiefly owing to the fact that they had been recruited at the outset among the better classes of the population&mdash;among those countrymen who, before the war, were in sufficiently easy circumstances to own a horse, and who, on enlisting, had brought it with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>Inured to bodily exercise, and having learned horsemanship in a country where the roads really accessible to carriages were scarce, they formed a class of mounted men already <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> well trained, which did not exist in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>They were moreover to have the advantage of almost invariably fighting on their own soil, of being well acquainted, therefore, with the minutest details of the ground on which they were to operate, and of being assisted by the connivance of the sympathizing inhabitants, ready to assume the character of volunteer spies in order to serve their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>In the war they had undertaken, they were sure to meet at every stage with provisions and aid of all kinds, together with valuable information and the necessary guides to enable them to avoid the enemy or to surprise him as they saw fit. The negroes themselves, notwithstanding their sympathies for the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>, became the involuntary auxiliaries of the cavalrymen of the <rs>South</rs>, who, long accustomed to live among them, knew better than the <rs>Federals</rs> how to make allowances for their lively imaginations, and to winnow out the truth from the exaggerated or contradictory reports which they hardly ever dared to withhold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>It will be seen from the narrative of the war how much this element of success contributed to build up the superiority of the <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName>; for it lost this superiority whenever it ventured upon the soil of the free States, and it failed miserably in all the expeditions which it undertook in the midst of hostile populations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>In organizing their army the <rs>Confederates</rs> were unable to supply it with a <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> equal to that of their adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>They had undoubtedly many able and well-trained officers; but as a general thing, their soldiers did not possess that intelligence and taste for the mechanical arts which, in a short time, converted the volunteers of the <rs>North</rs> into excellent artillerymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>As will be seen further on, their <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> was also of an inferior quality; and it required the courage and the daring of a few men like <persName n="Pendleton,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00101.00170" reg="mostcommon:Pendleton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00101.00171" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s chief of artillery, to compensate in part for this inferiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>This was not the case with the <orgName n="Confederate Artillery" type="artillery">Confederate artillery</orgName> in position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>That portion of it which had charge of the defences of their seaports was mostly recruited in the cities, among men who, from their education, resembled more the artisans of the <rs>North</rs> than the common whites of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>We shall see them, therefore, acquiring under able instructors a great precision of aim, and holding out in all the forts along the coast, especially at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, against the <rs>Federal</rs> armies and the ironclad <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> fleets that laid siege to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>But these men, who so coolly handled guns whose field of fire had long been studied, had a much easier task to perform than fell to the lot of those who, in the <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, had to place their guns in battery amid the confusion of battle, and to judge, by a single glance, of the exact distances on an unknown ground, in order to regulate the elevations and graduate the fuses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>The South had always regarded a partisan war as <num value="1">one</num> of its principal elements of defence in the struggle for which it had long been preparing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>As soon as it broke out bands were seen forming by the side of the regularly organized army, who declared their intention of fighting on their own account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>The independence they expected to find in this mode of warfare, the hope of plunder, and the attractions of an adventurous life drew into their ranks the most desperate characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>The remembrance of the <rs>Mexican</rs> brigands had remained in the <rs>South</rs> surrounded in a kind of romantic halo since the conquerors of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> had fought them and adopted their customs; and the men who only a few years before had attempted to wrest <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> by violence from the <rs>Northern</rs> settlers, in defiance of all laws, set an example, which was promptly followed, by organizing armed bands destined to become very popular in the <rs>South</rs> under the <rs>Spanish</rs> name of <hi rend="italics">guerillas</hi>. It will be seen, as we have already stated, how much the <rs>Confederates</rs> deceived themselves in relying upon these irregular troops to render it impossible for their adversaries to occupy any portion of the territory they might conquer, and in believing that they would persevere in the work of self-devotion when the cause should suffer on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>But if they never succeeded in playing more than an accessory part in regular warfare, that part was none the less an important <num value="1">one</num>; and so long as the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> held out, despite the ground they were losing, the guerillas, by their daring attacks upon the invader, were of immense assistance to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Appreciating the services that such combatants were able to render, the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> gave them an organization and an official character, which were to secure them the treatment of prisoners of war on the part of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>They signed the enlistment papers like other volunteers, their leaders were brevetted, <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> and placed under the authority of a few generals, who, nominally at least, had the supreme control of their movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>In reality, however, they preserved a perfect independence, and became, according to their respective characters and the qualities of their chiefs, either formidable soldiers, animated by a true military spirit, or merely armed marauders, who knew nothing of war except its most melancholy excesses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>Accordingly, the partisans who were organized in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, the most ardent, but also the noblest and most disinterested of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, were nearly all animated by sincere zeal, earnest devotion to their cause, and a sentiment of honor incompatible with such excesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>Young men of wealth and of good family enrolled themselves among them, certain of finding, in the humblest positions, an opportunity for acquiring that quickness of perception, that knowledge of the country, and that foresight into details which form the warrior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>The landowners and farmers, more numerous in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> than in the other slave States, who formed a large portion of these independent organizations, scarcely changed their habits on entering this new career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>They had been acquainted from their infancy with the vast forests where they were going to make war. All able-bodied men left the few villages scattered among these forests to enlist, and there was not a solitary house where some soldier of these bands was not sure of meeting some female relative or friend, where indeed all could not be greeted with a few words of sympathy, so calculated to add fresh courage to the wearied soldier when they fall from the lips of a woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>Such troops, so adapted for intercepting the despatches of an enemy, for picking up his stragglers, or attacking his convoys, for cutting railways and telegraph lines in his rear, were to form an excellent body of scouts to the regular army about to defend <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> against the <rs>Federal</rs> invasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>It must be admitted that the conduct of the <name>Virginians</name> was not always imitated by the other Confederate partisans, who were induced by less worthy motives to enroll themselves under the banner of the guerilla chiefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>The reputation of the latter promised them, with great fatigue, equally great plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>Consequently, the volunteers who gathered in crowds around them soon formed into bands which at times numbered several <num value="1000">thousand</num> <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>We shall see these bands constantly at work during those campaigns which desolated the <rs>Western States</rs>, destroying everything on their way, inflicting as much injury upon the most peaceful inhabitants of those regions as upon the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers they came to fight, and getting so far from the regular armies, on which they were supposed to depend, that they were very seldom of any assistance in their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>A minority, more or less numerous, in those States, being secretly hostile to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, this circumstance was made the pretext for offering, as an inducement to adventurers who abounded in the <rs>West</rs>, a regular system of pillage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>All who joined these organizations were authorized to take whatever might be useful to the band&mdash;horses, arms, equipments, etc.&mdash;from those inhabitants who were suspected of entertaining Union sentiments, and the soldiers who brought their booty to headquarters were promised the full value of the articles thus stolen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>The result might easily have been foreseen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>No partisan could fail of finding some cause for preferring charges of sympathy with the <rs>North</rs> against any <num value="1">one</num> who was worth the trouble of being robbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>This premium upon pillage necessarily rendered those soldiers who had to pass final judgment on the political opinions of those whose property they coveted very little scrupulous, and their number increased with their impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>In short, they became a subject of so much dread to their own friends that, had the war ended in the recognition of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>, the latter would have been obliged to inaugurate a new civil war, to get rid of those guerillas who had become regular gangs of bandits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/><num value="1">One</num> may form an opinion of the value of such soldiers by taking into consideration the character of their chiefs, and also by taking as a type of whatever there was of good and of evil among them, the <num value="3">three</num> men who contributed most to their organization, and whose names will most frequently occur in the course of what we shall have occasion to say regarding these corps of freebooters&mdash;Mosby, <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00104.00172" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,John,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00104.00173" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>His character and political passion drew around him men full of the same zeal as himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>Consequently, he received from them <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> the most unbounded obedience and absolute devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>A wary politician and a loyal citizen of his own State, when he saw, after the capitulation of the regular armies, that any further resistance would only unnecessarily increase the sufferings of his countrymen, he discharged his men with a few words full of noble sentiments, and with a pliability of mind peculiarly American, he quietly went back to his office and resumed his former life.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>Fiery before the conflict, but calm in action, of a generous disposition, but inflexible as a disciplinarian, he was better able than any other man to curb the brutal passions and develop the best instincts of the rough troopers who responded to his call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>Although their number allowed him occasionally during the war to direct long and complicated operations, he preserved throughout his career that love of personal adventure which had made him so popular; and thanks to the presence of mind which enabled him to get out of the most perplexing difficulties, he soon became <num value="1">one</num> of those heroes that abound in legendary story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>We shall relate his campaigns, but it would fill a volume to enumerate all the daring exploits by means of which he set an example to his soldiers from the very beginning of the war, riding among the <rs>Federal</rs> posts in order to ascertain their positions by personal observation, sometimes in the garb of a farmer, sometimes in the uniform of a Union officer, taking advantage of the former disguise to draw the enemy into the ambuscade he had prepared for him, and of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to issue, with imperturbable assurance, orders which would throw the enemy's movements into confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>Like a true Kentuckian, horses were his ruling passion; and if in the course of this narrative we shall find him attempting impossible enterprises, or suddenly diverting any of his expeditions from their apparent purpose, it is likely that the hope of carrying off some blood horses&mdash;the only booty he ever allowed himself to take&mdash;may have exercised an irresistible influence over his action.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>This veritable captain of military bandits, like those that were seen in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> during the <measure n="30Years" type="date">Thirty Years</measure> war, promised the adventurers whom he enlisted, not toleration, but the example of pillage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>He organized the band under his command into a corps of mounted infantry, in which every man was provided with a horse&mdash;less for the purpose of fighting than for executing rapid marches, at the end of which the men would dismount, take up their muskets, and carry the enemy's positions, thus suddenly attacked, at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>He found these tactics the more successful that he was not ashamed&mdash;no more than the <rs>Indian</rs>&mdash;to beat a hasty retreat whenever he found his adversary on his guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>His corps increased rapidly by the addition of other partisan bands, whose chiefs had acquired less celebrity than himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>He soon grew tired of being only a guerilla chief like <persName n="Mosby,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00106.00178" reg="mostcommon:Mosby,nomatch:0"><surname>Mosby</surname></persName> and <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00106.00179" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,John,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, and persuaded the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> to recognize the importance of his services by bestowing upon his band, composed of <num value="2">two</num> strong divisions of cavalry, the character of regular troops, and upon himself the rank of general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>The latter continued their career of murder and rapine on a larger scale, and the new general, who was formerly a slave-trader, continued to dishonor the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause by handling his sword as if, instead of that weapon, he still held in his hand the blood-stained whip of the dealer in human flesh. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/><emph>W</emph>E have shown in a former chapter the great and real cause of the civil war, and in another the military resources which the <rs>South</rs> called to its aid in order to sustain it. In this and the following chapter we propose to point out the principal features of the political crisis which preceded the civil war, and to relate the occurrences in the midst of which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> became divided into <num value="2">two</num> hostile camps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>We have stated that slavery had become the basis of the entire politico-economical edifice of the <rs>South</rs>; the servile institution must be placed beyond the reach of danger in order that this edifice might run no risk of falling to pieces, for, even though the institution itself was universally respected in the <rs>South</rs>, the mere vicinity of the free States was a perpetual menace to it. The prosperity of these States, the rapid increase of their population, which absorbed nearly all the emigration from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and their still more rapid extension of territory, secured to them a daily growing influence in the councils of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>The slave States had sought to balance this influence by extending the servile institution into the yet uncultivated sections of the continent, by disputing the territories recently opened to civilization with the settlers from the <rs>North</rs>, by wresting from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> some of her most valuable provinces; and they thought of further increasing the number of their States by seizing <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> and the whole coast of the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>They had succeeded, by means of a shrewd policy, in creating for themselves a considerable party in the <rs>North</rs>, whose support had long given them a preponderance in the <rs>Federal</rs> elections, and had enabled them to govern the <rs>Union</rs> in the interest of their policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>The advocates of this policy had unscrupulously taken advantage of the deep attachment <pb id="p.108" n="108"/> which the great majority of the <rs>American</rs> people entertained for their Constitution, and, by constantly threatening to break it up, by recourse to the most violent measures, they had obtained from them all the concessions necessary for the maintenance and development of their system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>But a day came when these concessions were no longer sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>Despite all their efforts, the slave-owners saw themselves outstripped&mdash;conquered by the progress of free labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>In order to secure the adherence of their partisans in the <rs>North</rs>, which alone could give them the control of public affairs, they were also obliged to make certain concessions in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>They could not impose upon the <rs>Republic</rs>, to its full extent, the policy on the success of which they had staked their fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>In <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> it was easy to foresee that their rule would not be of long duration, and that even if they succeeded in legally securing a government of their choice, that government could not prevent free labor from planting itself in the best portions of the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/><num value="2">Two</num> alternatives, both equally violent, presented themselves to them for shielding the servile institution from the danger which threatened it. They must either separate entirely from the free States, and found a new republic of slave States, freed from the control of their former associates; or forcibly extort from the latter the guarantees henceforth indispensable to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, and thus make sure of their supremacy over all the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>The aversion and jealousy entertained for the <rs>North</rs> led the majority of Southern slaveholders to adopt the idea of founding a separate Republic, in which they could, at their option, consolidate the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>But clear-sighted politicians, while commending this project, which favored their designs, foresaw the danger for the future, and fully understood that, in order to exist, a community founded upon slavery must not only be independent, but mistress of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>In fact, the maintenance of the <rs>Union</rs>, even under the <name>Presidency</name> of the most zealous abolitionist, would have been less dangerous to the <rs>Southern</rs> community than separation, pure and simple, dividing the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> into <num value="2">two</num> unequal parts; <num value="1">one</num> of these parts, supposing it to comprise all the slave States, without excepting those which remained faithful to the <rs>Federal</rs> flag, would have had a population of <num value="8000000">eight million</num> whites and <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> <num value="1000000">million</num> blacks; the other would have been composed of the rest of the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;that is to say, of the great body of the free States, continuing to form, under the <rs>Federal</rs> compact, a single nation from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <rs>Pacific</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>From amiable, or at least tolerant, associates, the latter would have become formidable rivals and implacable enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>Finding in their numerous population, in the productive system of free labor, and their vast financial resources, an irresistible element of colonization, they would have successfully competed with the <rs>Southern States</rs>, already fettered by slavery, divided into hostile castes, and deprived of the resources that emigration brings to the new continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>In a few years, the free States would have completely surrounded the territory occupied by the servile institution, and by thus closing the avenues of future expansion against it, they would have dealt it a mortal blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>Their vast frontiers would have been opened to fugitives from slavery, as soon as the shameful compact by which those neighboring States had pledged themselves to return the fugitive slave had been torn to pieces, with the very Union in whose name it had been procured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>In spite of all artificial barriers, a double contraband, favoring the escape of the slave on <num value="1">one</num> hand, would, on the other, have carrried into the <rs>South</rs> those abolition publications so much dreaded by the latter, which a secret but irresistible propagandism would have circulated among enslaved populations whom the faintest glimpse of liberty was sufficient to excite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>This inevitable consequence of separation was predicted long ago by the sagacious mind of <persName n="Tocqueville,,De,,," id="n0321.0004.00109.00180" reg="default:Tocqueville,De,,,"><foreName>De</foreName> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName>, who foresaw the day when slavery would bring on a terrible crisis, in the midst of which it would disappear, and which even seemed to him destined to prove fatal to <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>He had therefore counselled the men of the <rs>South</rs> to remain faithful to the <rs>Union</rs> at all hazards, because, sustained by the numerous white population of the <rs>North</rs>, he told them, they would be able to abolish slavery slowly without subverting the order of things, and still preserving their social superiority; whereas, if they made an enemy of that population, the latter would soon find a way of freeing their slaves in spite of them and against them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>A war of races, which the defeat of the <rs>South</rs> has rendered <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> unnecessary, would have been the certain result of the separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>Consequently, the leaders of the slavery party needed the support of the people of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>But it was for the purpose of maintaining and fortifying slavery, and not with a view of abolishing it gradually, that they asked for this support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> ways of obtaining it: either by reconstructing the <rs>Union</rs> to suit themselves; or, by dividing the <rs>North</rs> in such a manner that it would no longer have formed a compact nation by their side, the slave power would have found among its ruins a few weak States always ready to sue for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>In either case, the servile institution would have secured its necessary ascendency over the whole continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>The reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs> for their own benefit was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought of Southern politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>The capital of the <rs>Union</rs> was surrounded by slave States, inhabited by slaveholders, and the <rs>Federal</rs> laws sanctioned the existence of the peculiar institution of the <rs>South</rs> within its territory; they made sure, therefore, of its possession, and once assembled in the <rs>Capitol</rs>, they fully hoped that the necessity of forming <num value="1">one</num> great nation, that fidelity to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> itself, would rally around them the majority of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>The Union would thus be reconstituted under their auspices, and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, that focus of abolition, would perhaps alone be excluded from it, and left to vegetate in obscure mediocrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>The <orgName n="Montgomery Congress" type="congress">Montgomery Congress</orgName>, therefore, in drawing up the new Constitution of the <rs>Confederate</rs> slave States, took care to adopt, purely and simply, the old compact of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with <num value="2">two</num> important modifications&mdash;<num value="1">one</num>, to justify the past, the other, to guarantee the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> recognized the right of secession as a principle; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> proclaimed slavery as a fundamental institution of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Through this deceptive resemblance to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, it was hoped that all the <name>States</name> of the old Union would the more readily group themselves around the new Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>In order to effect this, it was necessary either to intimidate them by a bold <hi rend="italics">coup daetat</hi>, or to win them back, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, by dividing them, by wearying them out, and by showing them, in a manner calculated to impress them, the unanimous determination of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>We have shown by what violent means this apparent unanimity of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> procured; there was no more respect paid to the doctrine of State rights, the very foundation of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, than to the private rights of individuals; and, at a later period, an attempt on the part of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> to get rid of the despotism of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0004.00111.00181" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was treated as treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>If the re-establishment of the <rs>Union</rs> was not practicable, it was at least important to secure the supremacy of the new Confederacy by surrounding it with neighbors at once weak and divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>In order to accomplish this, war with the <rs>North</rs> was necessary, because a peaceful separation would have left her united under the old Federal Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>All the slave States, without exception, must be brought into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; the <rs>Mississippi</rs> must be closed against the <rs>Western States</rs>, and this outlet, so necessary for their produce, should only be opened in exchange for an alliance which would have reduced them to a state of vassalage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>It was important, above all, to make the <rs>Northern</rs> merchants feel the superiority of the military power of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, in order to secure to the latter the role of arbitrators among their neighbors, ruined by war and discouraged by defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>To realize this project, the leaders of the slave States counted chiefly upon the influence which the exclusive cultivation of cotton gave them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>They were convinced that neither <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> nor <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> could dispense with an article which they alone could supply, and they saw in it a guarantee for the maintenance of slavery, of which it was the fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>They did not believe that the working classes, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, would have the courage to undergo the severest privations, rather than give a word of encouragement to the cause of slavery, and they fully expected that these classes would compel the <rs>European</rs> governments to restore cotton to their looms, by intervening in behalf of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>Forgetting that the exports of the agricultural products of the <rs>North</rs> exceeded those of the <rs>South</rs>, they fancied that the whole world was dependent upon them, and, in their presumptuous language, they already announced the accession of <hi rend="italics"><persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName></hi>, before whom the sovereigns and the republics of the <num value="2">two</num> worlds would have to bow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Such were the views of the ambitious men who controlled the policy of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>At the opposite extreme were the abolitionists, who, with the foresight and the logic of champions of <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> positive ideas, felt, like them, that slavery must either rule or perish, and who, resolved to contest its power, were not afraid of attacking it in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>Equally enthusiastic and ardent in the struggle, they made light of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in their harangues whenever it seemed to them to favor the propagation of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>Justly convinced of the rectitude and sacredness of their cause, persuaded also that, in combating the servile institution without intermission or compromise, they were saving their country from shame and ruin, they entered the political arena with the courage, the faith, and the sternness of their ancestors the <name>Puritans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>So long as the struggle which they had foreseen was deferred, they did not number many adherents, but a day came when the whole nation rallied around the abolition flag, which they had carried so loftily and firmly, and when they had the satisfaction of witnessing the triumph of the principles of truth and justice, which they had never sacrificed to the exigencies of politics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>Between these <num value="2">two</num> extreme parties there were the masses of the people, loyal above all to the <rs>Union</rs>, loyal to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the benefits of which they enjoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>These masses were divided into <num value="2">two</num> parties, called <hi rend="italics">Democrats</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Republicans</hi>, according as they favored or opposed the slave policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>The Republicans, who were in the majority in most of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, did not attack slavery directly where it existed, and, respecting the right of every State to preserve it, they confined themselves to the task of restricting its extension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>The <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> was composed, in the first place, of a large portion of the <rs>Northern</rs> population, which desired to maintain the <rs>Union</rs> by making concessions to the servile institution and by tolerating its development; and secondly, of the immense majority of the <rs>Southern</rs> people who believed in their ability to retain the guarantees of slavery without resorting to illegal means or violating the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>The alliance between the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern Democrats and the extreme slave party had given, at all the general elections, an important majority to the politicians who defended the servile institution over the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, which was solely sustained by a small fraction of abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>They might still have possessed such majority in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>But, as we have already <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> stated, this advantage no longer satisfied them; they now wanted to establish their supremacy in a way not to be disputed, by a bold stroke of policy; and they preferred threats of war, and even war itself, to compromises henceforth insufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>They only required a pretext to draw after them their fellow-citizens who were yet faithful to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>We shall show how they sought this pretext in the <name>Presidential</name> elections of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>They had long used the entire power of the <rs>Federal</rs> government for the protection and extension of slavery; they had introduced it into a great number of territories which had been acquired by that government in the name of the whole community; sometimes protecting, in the name of the independence of the new States, those which, under their influence, admitted slavery; at other times, causing the central power to trace an imaginary line, south of which all the territories were to belong to the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>But when they thought of separating from the <rs>North</rs>, or at least threatened the <rs>North</rs> with violent separation, they denied that the <rs>Federal</rs> government had any right to interfere in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>This threat was a powerful political argument, and separation seeming to be the last resort when slavery should be in danger, a constitutional theory was needed to justify it. This was found in the dogma of the absolute sovereignty of the <name>States</name> &mdash;a doctrine which had for its apostle, between the years <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0004.00113.00182" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, the foremost statesman of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, who soon came to be considered as the palladium of the peculiar institutions of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>It is sufficient to sum up this doctrine in a few words, to show how specious and dangerous it was.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>The object of the <rs>Federal</rs> compact, between the colonies that had been freed by the war of independence, was to protect them against the divisions which weakened them, to unite them into <num value="1">one</num> indestructible group or cluster, and to make of them a single nation, while leaving them a local independence sufficient to protect them against the despotism of centralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>Each colony, in adopting this compact, made a perpetual cession of a portion of its sovereignty in favor of the new community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>The rights which were thus ceded constituted the prerogatives of the <rs>Federal</rs> power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>We cannot enumerate them here, but in order to show their importance, <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> it is sufficient to mention the right of waging war and making peace, the right of coining money, of collecting customhouse duties, and of representing the commonwealth in foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>The flag was national; civil and political rights were enjoyed in common by the citizens of all the <name>States</name>; no customhouse could be established in the interior; the <rs>Federal</rs> government had exclusive jurisdiction over certain questions of general interest; it was the sovereign arbiter both between States and between such States and private individuals aggrieved by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>Finally, besides its limited jurisdiction in the <name>States</name>, it exercised a sovereign authority over the <rs>Federal</rs> possessions and the new territories acquired by the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>The forts, the arsenals, and the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, which contained the seat of government, had been ceded to it with full right of property; the immense uncultivated regions where colonization daily extended were becoming peopled under its protection; and it alone could impart political life to territories sufficiently civilized to claim the right of adding another star to the azure field of the national flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>The very manner in which the national power was constituted proved that it represented <num value="1">one</num> single nation, and not an agglomeration of independent States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>This power was composed of a Senate and a <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, invested conjointly with political and legislative sovereignty; of a President, constituting the executive power; and finally, of a <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, whose province was to enforce the superior authority of the national laws, and to pass judgment as a court of final appeal upon all constitutional questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>With the exception of this tribunal, appointed by the <rs>President</rs>, the other powers (executive and legislative) were elective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>While the <name>Senate</name> represented in a proper measure the autonomy of the <name>States</name>, and comprised within its organization <num value="2">two</num> members sent by each of those political bodies, whatever their size or importance, the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> was the direct product of popular suffrage; the entire surface of the <rs>Union</rs> was divided into districts equal in population, each of which elected <num value="1">one</num> member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>The election of the <rs>President</rs>, although nominally of a twofold character, was also essentially national and proportioned to the population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>Each State designated as many special electors as it sent Representatives and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to Congress, and these <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> electors assembled in an <orgName n="Electoral College" type="college">electoral college</orgName>, which in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> was composed of <num value="303">three hundred and three</num> members, whose only mission was to vote for a President.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>With the exception of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, which left the right of their selection to the legislature, these electors were chosen by popular vote, and all were positively instructed to vote for such or such candidate; the result of the vote for <rs type="role2">President</rs> was thus known at the same time as the names of the electors designated by the ballot, and the election was thus practically reduced to a single point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>The Federal law gave to the slave States an unjustifiable advantage in the formation of the electoral districts, by taking into account the servile population, which did not however possess any political rights, and by counting <num value="5">five</num> negroes as equivalent to <num value="3">three</num> white men. This advantage was also granted to them in the <name>Presidential</name> elections, and they were more than once indebted to it for successes which the free States only accepted out of respect for the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>Strong party organizations, which are indispensable in proportion as the institutions are more democratic, could alone carry such an election into effect, and give to the choice of electors the character of a national manifestation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>Accordingly, each party held free meetings or conventions, composed of distinguished men selected in all the <name>States</name> by permanent party committees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>It was in these preliminary assemblies that the merits of the various candidates for the <name>Presidency</name> were discussed; and, the choice once made, the whole party, owing to its innumerable ramifications and its permanent committees, went to work with the utmost harmony to secure the election of the delegates pledged beforehand to vote in favor of their candidate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>Such was the entire national edifice&mdash;an edifice founded on Federal institutions, on the common interest which they guaranteed and the public life they had developed&mdash;which the doctrine of State sovereignty was seeking to undermine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>Those who had adopted it pretended that each State was at all times at liberty to resume the sovereignty it had ceded to the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, in virtue of the <rs>Federal</rs> compact; that the <name>States</name> which had been created since the <rs>Union</rs> had an equal right to do the same; and that the powerful Republic, the unity of which had benefited each of them in turn, was thus to be dismembered at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sign of local <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> opposition that the constitutional enactments and the voice of the majority might encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>Such a theory, logically applied, would lead to endless divisions and to the destruction of all nationality, for no confederation could have existed under such conditions; the <name>States</name> themselves would soon have been broken up by the claims of the counties of which they were composed to separate from them; and if the <rs>Northern States</rs> had sanctioned this theory by allowing the slaveholders quietly to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, they could not have prevented other secessions from taking place in their midst, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> symptom of those inevitable differences the solution of which had hitherto been left to the popular vote.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>We have already shown how little the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders thought of State sovereignty as soon as they had organized their new Confederacy; but at the time of which we speak this fatal doctrine had taken a strong hold of the public mind in all the slave States, and it dragged the most loyal citizens into the rebellion, as soon as the usurping legislatures had declared in favor of separation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>It was no longer possible to indulge in any self-deceptions regarding the power of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>The <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> volunteers that had been asked of the several States were evidently insufficient to fight it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>This clause showed that the authorities comprehended at last what the duration of the war might be, but it did not prevent volunteers from rushing in crowds to offer their services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>The desire to defend the <rs>Union</rs> animated all hearts, while the want of work, caused by the prevailing stagnation in every kind of business, facilitated enlistments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>The standing army was to be reconstructed by the call, made at the same time, for <num value="22714">twenty-two thousand seven hundred and fourteen</num> regulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Finally, a levy of <num value="18000">eighteen thousand</num> sailors to fit out a naval fleet was ordered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>The navy was about to have a hard task to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>The extent of the <rs>Southern</rs> coasts, indented with deep bays, possessing excellent ports, and presenting numerous inlets for shelter and safety to those acquainted with the labyrinth of islands and estuaries to be found there, afforded great facilities for trade, smuggling, and maritime warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>The leaders of the rebellion were preparing to take advantage of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>The Southern States, devoted to the cultivation of cotton and the sugar-cane, had hitherto depended entirely upon Northern merchants and navigators, who exported their produce, and brought them in exchange, either from <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, nearly all the commodities necessary to a civilized community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>They thought the old continent could not dispense with their produce any more than they could with its commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>They relied, moreover, upon the spirit of speculation, being convinced that it would not fail to come to them for cotton, of which they were the sole possessors, and supply them with arms and munitions of war in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>In short, if they <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> could exist without articles of luxury, and if a change in the cultivation of the soil would secure them provisions, the spoils of the <rs>Union</rs> arsenals would not suffice to equip all the troops they proposed to raise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>A direct trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> was therefore indispensable to them; this was carried on under the flags of neutral powers, especially that of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>The flag of the new Confederacy could not be hoisted except on vessels fitted out for warpurposes, otherwise it would have been at the mercy of the numerous Federal cruisers; but the few privateers that carried it&mdash;many of which never even once touched at a Confederate port&mdash;showed, by the injury they inflicted upon the merchant navy of the <rs>North</rs>, what a formidable arm the insurgents would have had in their hands if they had been able to fit out those vessels in their own ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>It was necessary, therefore, in view of these facts, to establish a strict blockade of their coasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>Every government has the right to blockade the ports under the jurisdiction of its sovereignty through the medium of a proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>The Constitution having conferred upon the <rs>Federal</rs> power the exclusive privilege of establishing and collecting custom-house duties, the moment that the insurrection prevented the government from collecting such duties on land, the blockade was its only alternative for maintaining this privilege, and it could resort to such alternative without going beyond the limits of its prerogatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>Accordingly, on the <dateStruct value="-04-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0004.00151.00304" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> issued a proclamation declaring all the coasts of the <name>States</name> then in rebellion in a state of blockade, and on the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="2">29th</day></dateStruct>, when the secession of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> was imminent and that of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had been proclaimed, he extended the blockade to those States likewise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>To establish an effective blockade along a coast which extends from the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> on the frontier of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> to the mouth of the <placeName reg="Hodgson Point, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,7020782">Potomac</placeName> near <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, was an immense undertaking; we shall see presently how the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> went to work to accomplish this task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>Disorganized, scattered, and lacking the necessary number of vessels, it naturally could not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> establish the blockade as strictly everywhere as modern usages require in cases of international wars; this gave rise to frequent disputes with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> powers, whose commerce was attracted to Southern ports by the precious deposits of cotton which had accumulated <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>But, as we shall explain at the end of this volume, those powers transcended their rights when, instead of protesting against the blockade, if they found it ineffectual, they made its establishment a pretext for recognizing the belligerent rights of the insurgents.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>Besides the pay, which was enormous, the volunteers were promised, as in former times, land bounties at the expiration of their term of service&mdash;a wise measure which induced many workingmen to enter the army by ensuring to them the certain means of existence at the end of the war. Lastly, the recruiting-office opened a new field to that unfortunate, restless, and ambitious population which <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> renders <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> the good service to absorb as fast as she receives it, and which, like foam upon the waters, floats for a time in the large cities of the <rs>Union</rs>, and is ultimately lost in the great current which bears it towards the far <rs>West</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>The soldiers for the most part were animated by a sincere desire to serve the national cause, and the proportion of different elements which constituted its strength accurately represented the whole American nation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>In a country where every able-bodied man can easily earn a living, and where the products of the soil are so abundant as to admit of an almost indefinite advance in wages, the government could never have held out sufficient inducements to attract the <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men who in a single year responded to its call, if a large majority of them had not been actuated by sterling patriotism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>This army was as national in its composition as it was in spirit, representing in due proportion the various elements of the <rs>American</rs> population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>And yet, notwithstanding the ties which bound the emigrant to that country, the foreign element was not proportionately represented in the composition of the national army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>The soldiers born on American soil were more numerous than if the army had been recruited by a draft bearing equally on all the citizens of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>A few figures will suffice to confirm this assertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Of the volunteers who enlisted during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year, only <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> were <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> foreigners; of the remainder, <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> were born on American soil, and <num value="7">seven</num>-thirtieths, or rather less than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, were naturalized Europeans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>By examining separately the contingents of the <rs>Eastern States</rs>, where but a small number of emigrants settle, we find a still larger proportion of natives&mdash;a proportion which in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, when conscription was partially resorted to, reached as high as <num value="0.8">eighty per cent.</num> This army, <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of which consisted of native <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00181.00434" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, and only <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of foreigners, was raised out of a population of about <num value="19000000">19,000,000</num> souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>In order to ascertain which of these <num value="2">two</num> elements supplied the largest proportion of men, we have only to compare the number of ablebodied men that each of them was able to contribute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>The statistics of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> render this comparison impracticable; but the census of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, taken in the loyal States preparatory to the conscription, gave upwards of <num value="3100000">3,100,000</num> as the number of men between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure>. By adding <num value="900000">900,000</num> more, the maximum number of soldiers then in actual service or disabled, it may safely be affirmed that the class which in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> contributed exclusively to the recruitment of the army did not exceed <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>With the help of the emigrant rolls, it is easy to calculate how many of these were born in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> and how many in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>During the decade from <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct> the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> received <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num> new-comers, <num value="1200000">1,200,000</num> of whom were women and <num value="1800000">1,800,000</num> men; <num value="1370000">1,370,000</num> of the latter being over <num value="15">fifteen</num> and under <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> of age. Deducting <num value="8000">8000</num> from this number, which, according to the tables of mortality, is the decrease of that population since its arrival in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, we find that emigration had, in the course of <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, brought over to that country <num value="1362000">1,362,000</num> men, who, when the levies of volunteers took place, were still living and between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="38">thirty-eight</num>, and, consequently, forming part of the <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num> among whom the <rs>American</rs> army was recruited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>This number already exceeds by <num value="31000">31,000</num> the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of those <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num>; but in order to make our statement complete, we should add thereto the number of Europeans who in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> were between <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> and <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure>, as well as those who at the time of their landing before <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct> were under <measure n="33years" type="date">thirty-three years</measure> of age, inasmuch as both categories were comprised in the <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>We see, therefore, <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> that those of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> birth constituted considerably more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the effective male population of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, while they only entered in just the same proportion of onethird into the composition of the army, thus leaving to the native <rs>Americans</rs> the largest proportion in the aggregate representation of races.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>We are not in possession of the necessary documents to continue this comparison by ascertaining the number of those emigrants who became naturalized, and those who retained their condition of aliens; such a comparison would, however, be of little value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>Naturalization is so easily obtained in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that after a few years' residence in the country nearly every person settled in business exercises the rights of citizenship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>It was only when the conscription attached onerous duties to the exercise of these rights that people who had enjoyed them endeavored to discover informalities in their naturalization papers, in order to get rid of the obligations devolving upon <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00182.00435" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>All emigrants who have left <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> without any intention of returning&mdash; <hi rend="italics">sans esprit de retour</hi>, as the <rs>French</rs> law tersely expresses it&mdash;should, in reality, be reckoned as <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00182.00436" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, the number of those who persist in preserving their nationality unimpaired being altogether insignificant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>Strictly speaking, those belonging to the latter category alone, and the recruits obtained from outside the territory of the <rs>Republic</rs>, could be considered as foreigners, among the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>The Federal government could only have introduced a large foreign element into the ranks of its army by enticing volunteers from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> or from countries adjacent to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>Now, notwithstanding the close vigilance with which all the actions of that government were watched, its enemies never could prove that such enlistments had been made on its account upon any large scale; there was seen nothing in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> to be compared with the foreign legion organized by <persName n="England,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00182.00437" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> for the <rs>Crimean War</rs>. The navy may indeed have picked up a handful of sailors from the coasts of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> or <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, or it may have received a few of the deserters which every <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> ship drops into the ports of the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Doubtless, also, some <name>English</name> soldiers from the garrisons of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> may have crossed the frontier, <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> allured not only by the bounties and high pay, but also by the hope that their military experience would secure them positions among such raw troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>It was easy to recognize under the <rs>Federal</rs> uniform the old <name>English</name> soldier by his unexceptionable bearing, his polished arms, and the precision of his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>If not disqualified by drunkenness, he soon became drillsergeant or sergeant-major; if able to read and write, the epaulet was within his easy reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>These, however, were only isolated instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>It is true that recruiting agents, hoping to make a profit on the bounties, went to <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> and <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> to decoy recruits in spite of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, and that they engaged emigrants to come over in the name of fictitious industrial associations, expecting to entice them into the service after they had landed, partly of their own free will, partly by force; but the measures taken in New York and elsewhere to protect these emigrants against the impositions of which they were formerly the victims enabled them to free themselves as soon as the fraud was discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>This was the case with most of them; and although the recruiters were always on the watch to entrap the most destitute among those whom want had driven from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to the <rs>American</rs> shores, they were less successful with these new-comers than with those who had been for some time settled in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>We may therefore sum up all these details by affirming that, from the native-born American down to the latest-landed <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName>, the proportion of volunteers furnished to the <rs>Federal</rs> government by the different classes of the community was in a direct ratio to the interest that each took in the affairs of the <rs>Republic</rs>, and that the longer the emigrant had lived upon its soil, the more largely did he contribute toward its defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>It must not be imagined, therefore, that the increase of emigration, so remarkable during the war, was a means of directly supplying the <rs>Federal</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>It was an indirect result due to the sudden advance in the price of labor occasioned by the war. The difference in the rate of wages between the <num value="2">two</num> continents is the sluice which regulates with precision the current of emigration; and the new-comers, instead of swelling the ranks of the army, went for the most part to fill, either at the plough or in <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> the factories, the places of the <rs>Americans</rs> who had put on the uniform.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>It is by the average age of the soldiers that national armies are most readily distinguished from mercenary troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>An army of mercenaries is made up of men who make a trade of warfare, serving for a livelihood and enlisting from motives of interest; the larger their number the higher the average of age. A national army, on the contrary, is recruited in equal proportions among all the youth of the country, as well from voluntary as from forced service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>Now, the average age of the volunteers who enlisted in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> before any conscription had taken place was between <num value="24">twenty-four</num> and <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure>, or the same as that of our own soldiers before it was raised above this figure by the exoneration law and the multiplicity of substitutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>The larger or smaller proportion of Europeans, or at least of men recently from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in the contingents of the several States, was made manifest in the military statistics by a remark we may be allowed to quote, as throwing a curious light upon the movements of the populations that elbow <num value="1">one</num> another for a long time in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> before they become finally mingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>Nothing, in fact, appears more strange, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight, than the comparison of the average statures in the contingents of the several States, as shown by the tables published at the end of the war, at a time when the conscription necessitated a scrupulous examination of all the men enrolled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>Neither climate nor latitude can explain why that average varied so strangely from <num value="1">one</num> State to another, in the <rs>Middle</rs> as well as in the <rs>Northern</rs> and Western States; or why <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, for instance, furnished the highest average, while, after the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>, those of the far <rs>West</rs>, such as <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName> and <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, sent the smallest men to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>This last result is all the more striking because in those new States, where the human race seems to develop with greater freedom, there exists a truly athletic population of lumbermen, living from generation to generation in the virgin forest, who, when formed into companies and at times into regiments, presented a line of perfect grenadiers that struck the officers of the <rs>British Guards</rs> with admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>The reason is that alongside of them, in the same contingent, there was a race whose inferiority <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> was but poorly compensated by the former, namely, that of the <name>German</name> emigrants and their descendants down to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>These strange variations are all explained by the movements of emigration on the soil of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, and the average stature of each contingent was in inverse ratio to the number of emigrants who had settled in the <rs>State</rs> that furnished it. The current of emigration emptied itself at New York and certain points of the northern coast, where the weakest and the least robust took up their residence, while the others, passing through the <rs>Middle States</rs>, where the population was comparatively numerous, and shut out from the <rs>South</rs> by the insurmountable barrier of slavery, went to seek their fortunes in those vast Western States that are watered by the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">Upper</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and the great lakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>This current leaving <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName> at the north and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> at the south, and traversing <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> too rapidly to leave traces of its passage behind, these States possessed therefore a population which, for the most part, had already become American for <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> generations back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>It is from this time that the beneficent influence of the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> upon the <rs>European</rs> races is felt; hence the physical superiority, seemingly inexplicable, of the contingents furnished by these <num value="3">three</num> States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>The elements of a truly national army were therefore assembling in the recruiting-offices which had been opened from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other of the <name>States</name> loyal to the <rs>Union</rs>; we must now show how this improvised army was organized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>A certain number of these offices would co-operate to form a regiment, the effective strength of which, as in the regular army, was usually fixed at a minimum of <num value="850">850</num> men. As soon as this figure was reached the regiment entered in numerical order into the contingent of its State, and nothing remained to be done in order to establish it but to arrange its list of officers and give it a regimental <hi rend="italics">cadre</hi>. In all the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs>, the governor is the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of all the local armed forces, as the <rs>President</rs> is of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, and he has the disposal of all the grades appertaining to those local forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>But custom prevails everywhere over law, and so inveterate is the habit of electing nearly all public functionaries, that in several States the governors had to confine themselves to the confirmation of the choice already made by <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> the soldiers themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>During the <rs>Mexican</rs> campaign the volunteers, being far away from their respective States, had already fallen into the habit of replacing such of their officers as had fallen in battle by improvised elections held around the campfires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>But in the formation of the new regiments of which we are now speaking, there were certain circumstances which interfered with the choice of the soldiers as well as that of the governor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>Whether it was owing to some tacit agreement, or a positive contract between the governor, the new soldiers, and the principal recruiting-agents, the latter were generally made sure in advance of grades proportionate to the importance of the services rendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>Thus the application of the extreme principles of democracy revived the system of proprietary colonels, and the course pursued by American communities for the prompt organization of their military forces resembled in many respects the formation of those independent companies of cavalry <hi rend="italics">companiess d'ordonnances</hi>) which in the <rs>Middle Ages</rs> constituted the nucleus of standing armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>Indeed, the man who by his activity and influence, and the expenditure of his time and money, succeeded in raising a regiment, and had perhaps even given his name to it, occupied quite a different position from that of an officer in the regular army, who can only rise to superior rank in the order of seniority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>He became colonel of that regiment by right, and, without positive proof of unworthiness, he could not be deprived of its command, unless, indeed, the difficulty was compromised by making him a general.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>Besides these volunteer regiments formed for the occasion, the greatest portion of the old militia organizations, filled up by new enlistments, were incorporated in like manner into the contingent of each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>As soon as organized they were all received by the <rs>Federal</rs> agents and regularly mustered into the service of the <rs>Republic</rs>, without, however, breaking off their connection with the authorities of their respective States, who reserved to themselves certain important rights in their administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>The intervention of these <num value="2">two</num> different powers, at the beginning of the war, was productive of more advantage than inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>Instances of conflict between them were rare and insignificant; and this system, by making a division of labor, and encouraging a <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> wholesome rivalry between the <name>States</name>, enabled the army to acquire a much more rapid organization than it would have done if the <rs>Federal</rs> government had undertaken this formation alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>In those critical moments when a nation's life depends, not upon the perfection of the means employed for saving her, but upon their prompt application, people accustomed to leave individual action entirely unfettered well know how to turn all their resources to immediate account, whereas a centralized administration, accustomed to do everything itself, has but too often to struggle in hopeless incapacity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>The Federal government, therefore, was required by law to arm and equip the volunteers; but as it stood in need of everything at the very moment when all had to be created at once&mdash;as its arsenals, which would have been insufficient for the emergency even if well supplied, had been plundered by the instigators of rebellion, and could not even furnish a musket, a coat, or a pair of shoes for the improvised defenders of the country&mdash;most of the <name>States</name> themselves undertook to furnish those outfits for troops which they raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>The small <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">State of Rhode Island</placeName>, whose speciality has always been the manufacture of ordnance, sent to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> several batteries provided with horses, and all the necessary accoutrements for taking the field at once.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>The day when a new regiment was delivered over to the <rs>Federal</rs> authority and took the oath of allegiance to the <rs>Union</rs>, that authority took it under pay, and assumed the responsibility of providing for its maintenance; each soldier received an entrance bounty, and the promise of a land-grant on the day of his discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>This promise secured to him a fixed and certain remuneration at the close of his term of service; for if his bounty, paid in paper money, decreased in value in consequence of the depreciation of the currency, the nominal price of the land, having increased in like proportion, enabled him to gain on <num value="1">one</num> hand what he lost on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>The depreciation of paper money, however, weighed but lightly upon the volunteer, even during his term of service, for from <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> his pay was gradually raised from <num value="11">eleven</num> to <measure n="16dollars" type="currency">sixteen dollars</measure> per month, and the value of bounties given by the <rs>Federal</rs> government was increased in like manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>Here again the independent initiative already referred <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> to is seen lending a helping hand to the central authority; States, large cities, individual corporations, and even private subscriptions, would occasionally swell the amount of those bounties by direct contributions of more or less importance, and, either by donations or fixed pensions, secure the means of existence to the wife and children of the soldier, who was thus enabled to face death without fear of leaving his family in want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Although mustered into the service of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, the regiment was still subject to the authority of the <rs>State</rs> whose name it bore, in all matters affecting its <hi rend="italics">personnel;</hi> and if the process of recruiting continued, which was unfortunately rarely the case, it could only be within the limits of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>Each governor had under his control a sort of miniature <orgName n="War Department" type="department">war department</orgName> called the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>'s office</orgName>, which kept up relations with the regiments scattered throughout the <rs>Federal</rs> armies, and despatched special inspectors to watch over them and inquire into their wants; in short, it continued to exercise the exclusive right of filling up vacancies among the officers, from the rank of second lieutenant to that of colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>The central government, in taking these officers into its service, had, it is true, reserved to itself the right of dismissing such as were deemed incapable, and even of withdrawing their commissions and suspending their pay at will, without any explanation; but it had not the power to replace them itself; generals commanding in the field had to apply to the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs> of each State for the promotion of any officers belonging to the contingent of that State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>These rights once reserved to the local authorities of the <name>States</name>, the volunteer regiments only obeyed the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>They were governed by the military code of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; the government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> alone directed their movements, and could send them at will from <num value="1">one</num> extremity of the continent to the other; it could separate them from those who had originally formed the same contingent with themselves, and distribute them among armies, divisions, and even brigades, where they would meet with soldiers belonging to another section of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>Finally, it had the direct appointment of generals, staff officers, and of the administrative departments in the armies thus constituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/><pb id="p.189" n="189"/></p> 
<p>Besides these national troops, the <name>States</name> more immediately threatened by their proximity to the seat of insurrection, also organized forces for the defence of their respective territories; and in order to attain this end more effectually, they sometimes formed mutual associations without the intervention of the central power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>Wherever danger appeared imminent, the spirit of local initiative called into existence new and sudden resources.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>When, in <dateStruct value="1861-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, for instance, Congress voted the levy of <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> men, of which we shall speak in proper time, the <name>States</name> adjoining the frontier of slavery had anticipated the call, and organized forces for their own protection against the insurgents, who, as we have seen, were arming in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>These troops had their own generals and staff officers, whose rank was confined to the <rs>State</rs> that had conferred it upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>Numerous regiments were thus raised in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>. <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, united under the auspices of a free association, organized a <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName>, and had the good fortune to entrust its command to <persName n="McClellan,Captain,,,," id="n0321.0004.00189.00438" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, whom the regard of his former companions in arms had unanimously designated for that arduous position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>Thanks to his exertions, this preliminary organization had the advantage of serving as a school for those troops which were soon to enter the <rs>Federal</rs> service, and with which, shortly afterwards, he achieved in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> success of the war. We shall see it again on all critical occasions during the struggle, and especially when the territory of the free States was invaded by the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>These militia troops thus assembled in haste may occasionally from a distance have deceived those armies and retarded their movements, by making them believe in the presence of a powerful force, but they were more frequently a source of embarrassment than of support to the generals of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the insignificant part they played on all occasions was the only <num value="1">one</num> suited to troops so utterly destitute of all the qualities that constitute a true soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>Before we follow to the field the armies whose improvised organization we have just described, it is proper that we should point out the peculiar characteristics which, in every branch of the service, distinguished them from the regular troops whose batties <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> are closely watched by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; this is necessary to a proper understanding of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> events of the war which we are about to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>In order to form a correct judgment of the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commanders</rs> who directed that war, it is necessary to have a perfect knowledge of the good qualities and defects of the instrument they had to handle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>The American foot-soldier displayed from the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a great deal of personal bravery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>The conflicts among the woods, where he was to fall unnoticed and to die without help, afforded the strongest evidence of this kind of courage, for they deprived him of that powerful incentive of all human action, the hope that his name would not die with him; it was nevertheless in these encounters, under the green shroud of the forest, that he exhibited all his firmness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>He very soon acquired a remarkable skill in firing, and quickly learned to hit his mark as a skirmisher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>While fighting in line, his fire had not the regularity of the drill-ground, but every soldier, using his weapon as he pleased, would hide behind a tree; and picking out the enemy from under the foliage as soon as he partially exposed himself, he knew how to aim with fatal precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/><num value="1">One</num> fact which was brought to light by the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">surgeon-general</rs> on the war demonstrates this peculiar skill of the combatants on both sides, and throws a curious light on the nature of the struggle of which the <rs>American</rs> forests were the theatre; it shows that in a certain number of Federal hospitals there were under treatment more than <num value="36000">thirty-six thousand</num> wounds in the head and arms, against only <num value="29000">twenty-nine thousand</num> in the legs; and this is easily explained by the position of the soldier, who, concealed behind the trunk of a tree, only exposed his head and arms when he discharged his piece.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>But these personal qualities are not sufficient to impart to a body of troops that collective courage which inspires every man with the same spirit, and enables it to undertake with unanimity of purpose what no individual among those composing it could have attempted by himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>This distinctive trait of well-trained armies, which constitutes their superiority, is the result of long habits of discipline, and the influence of old and experienced <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi>. <pb id="p.191" n="191"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>Indeed, whatever may be his personal courage, the soldier who is unaccustomed to being under fire, placed between comrades who are as great novices as himself, and opposite to a large body of the enemy, very soon persuades himself that every musket in the enemy's ranks is levelled at his breast, forgetting that as many friendly weapons are by his side to sustain him. He may brave his peril, but will lack that entire confidence in the courage of his neighbors and the skill of his chiefs which tends to draw closer the ranks of a broken force, and urges the soldier to follow the lead of his officers in a desperate effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>The controlling influence of a severe discipline could not be felt among armies entirely new, where the epaulet did not carry with it that moral authority which is acquired by long service, and where the soldiers did not possess the assurance of men who have seen each other under trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>Easily impressed, like all multitudes, these men, accustomed to complete freedom of action, went into battle in a spirit of obedience which is rather rational than passive, and were actuated more by a sense of duty as citizens than by the habitude of the disciplined soldier, who forgets his own volition to follow that of his chief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>Consequently, notwithstanding their bravery, it took them a long time to learn that, upon ground where the fighting had to be done at short distances, it was almost always less dangerous to rush upon the enemy than to be decimated by his fire while standing still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>For want of that mechanism which, in wellregulated armies, communicates the will of the directing power to each man, as rapidly as the nerves in the human body, they were frequently to lose the opportunity of turning a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> advantage into a decisive victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>When certain death awaited those occupying the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ranks, when it was so easy to march with less rapidity than the rest, personal courage could not be displayed to the same extent by all; if a single man hesitated or was allowed to hesitate with impunity, it was enough to render that hesitation contagious, causing the bravest soldier to lose his dash, and the most resolute chief all his daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>So long as that absolute despotism alluded to by <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00191.00439" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> did not impose the same obligations upon the timid, to be found everywhere, as upon the <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> bravest, the <rs>American</rs> volunteers could not escape those inevitable consequences of the human character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>Encounters with sword and bayonet, which seldom occur even between well-trained troops, were consequently very rare in American battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>Besides, infantry charges could only take place in open spaces or clearings, which form a kind of oasis in the forest, too dense for troops to march in serried ranks and suddenly to charge the enemy with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>In those close fights everything was in favor of the party acting on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>The assailant was openly exposed to the fire of an adversary hidden along the skirt of the wood; if he reached the spot, the density of the forest rendered all pursuit impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>A barricade of fallen trees enabled the party assailed to rally and to drive the aggressor back into the clearing, more dangerous to cross a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; finally, if the latter had not well reconnoitred his flanks resting on the sides of the clearing, he was liable at any time to find himself exposed to an oblique fire from artillery concealed under the foliage; we shall see how this fear of masked batteries played upon the imagination and colored the stories of the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers in the beginning of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>These forest conflicts, however, possessed a great advantage for new troops; the view being intercepted, panics could not be propagated, and the firing of the soldiers was slower, and consequently much better, than when they found themselves in an open space, where the terrible sights which surrounded them disturbed their equanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>A curious circumstance mentioned in the official accounts of the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs>, which was fought upon ground comparatively little wooded, shows to what extent, on both sides, the excitement of the conflict caused the loss of self-possession among soldiers who had been accustomed for some time to handling their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>Among <num value="24000">twenty-four thousand</num> loaded muskets picked up at random on the field of battle, <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> only were properly loaded; <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> contained each a double charge, and the other <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> charges; in some there were <num value="6">six</num> balls to a single charge of powder; others contained <num value="6">six</num> cartridges, <num value="1">one</num> on the top of the other without having been opened; a few more, <num value="23">twenty-three</num> complete charges regularly inserted; and finally, in the barrel of a single musket there were found confusedly <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> jumbled together <num value="22">twenty-two</num> balls, <num value="62">sixty-two</num> buck-shot, with a proportionate quantity of powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>These souvenirs of the battle admirably depict the confusion; we can easily imagine the soldier stopping to load his gun while his companions are advancing, and instead of stepping to the front and firing off his piece, renewing the operation of loading until the weapon becomes a useless instrument in his hands; but we should not severely criticise the <rs>American</rs> soldier on this account, for it appears that an examination of the battle-fields of the <name>Crimea</name> gave similar results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>In consequence of the independent character of the <rs>Federal</rs> volunteers, more than <num value="1">one</num> general saw, in the battles we shall have to describe, a certain victory turned into defeat, while on the other hand, the most disastrous checks could almost always be remedied; a sort of public opinion existing among them even in the midst of conflicts, we shall find them stoically suffering themselves to be killed at their post so long as they are actuated by a spirit of rivalry; then, suddenly persuading themselves that further resistance is useless, at the very moment perhaps when it would have decided the fate of a battle, they fall back to the rear in search of a better position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>This retreat, which no effort on the part of the officers can prevent, is however effected without hastening their pace, in spite of a shower of balls, and with a degree of coolness which would be admirable under other circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>And, what is still more remarkable, this temporary disorder seldom degenerated into a rout; a few minutes would often suffice to stop the fugitives, restore confidence among them, re-form their ranks, and restore all the authority of their chiefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>A moment after, these soldiers, so suddenly discouraged, would refuse to believe themselves beaten, and this conviction would be almost equivalent to a victory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>At the very outset of the campaign, the inexperience of the <rs>Federal</rs> volunteers was made evident, even more on the march than on the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>In fact, a body of troops which has had no practice cannot, with the best intentions in the world, make a long march without straggling on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>We shall see at the end of the war <rs>Sherman</rs>'s soldiers traversing the half of a continent and conquering success through the vigor of their legs, while those of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0321.0004.00193.00440" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> carried a load of <measure n="45l." type="pounds"><num value="45">forty-five</num> pounds</measure> on their shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/><pb id="p.194" n="194"/> But at the time of which we speak, they had not yet acquired that great art of the soldier which consists in bearing fatigue and taking rest in a systematic manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>They ate a great deal, did not know how to economize their food, adjusted their knapsacks clumsily, and could only carry <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's march, which used up a great number, although very short, already filled the road with stragglers, who, while directing their steps towards the place assigned for the halt, did not consider themselves bound to keep up with their comrades, and whom a fresh spring of water or a shady spot would keep back; fortunately for the <rs>Federal</rs> armies, the <rs>Confederate</rs> guerrillas, in picking up such stragglers, did more towards putting a stop to this fatal habit than the severest orders of the day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>The mounted volunteers naturally took the regular cavalry for their model, and imitated their mode of fighting, which, as we have already observed, recalled that of the old dragoons of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century&mdash;a curious comparison between the ancient military customs of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and those of modern <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>If those troopers borrowed the carbine of the regulars, it was not because they had to fight an enemy as swift in flight as the <rs>Indian</rs> of the prairies, but that every inexperienced soldier, when he can choose between side-arms and firearms, always prefers the latter, which does not compel him to come to close quarters with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>Besides, in order to handle a sabre or a lance, <num value="1">one</num> should be fully able to manage a horse, and the horsemanship of the <rs>Federal</rs> volunteers at the beginning of the war was deplorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>They did not fire from their saddles like the troopers of the times of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>., but got into the habit of fighting on foot, leaving their horses in charge of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of their number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>The wooded and rugged character of the country was suited to this mode of warfare, but would not have admitted of those great and rapid evolutions of a cavalry relying solely on the swiftness of their horses, if such cavalry had existed in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>The cavalry, however, at the outset of the war, confined itself to the complicated task of scouting for the armies, and acting as skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>This service, although difficult for young troops, was not altogether new to American horsemen, accustomed to an adventurous life which suited their spirit of personal enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/><pb id="p.195" n="195"/> If they did not always possess the just instinct of war, nor that abiding vigilance indispensable in the presence of an enemy, they made up these deficiencies by their intelligence and daring; a great number of little engagements, which cannot find a place in our narrative, afforded them opportunities to show that the inventive mind of the <rs>Americans</rs> was never at fault when it became necessary to devise a stratagem or to make combinations for some bold stroke.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>At a later period the importance of the cavalry was developed by the new part assigned to it in those <hi rend="italics">raids</hi> or large independent expeditions, of which we shall speak hereafter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>The artillery could not find amid the <rs>American</rs> forests favorable ground and those large open spaces where it can operate with most effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>As we have seen at Big Bethel, fieldpieces were placed as <hi rend="italics">vedettes</hi> near the most advanced sentinels of those new armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>This practice, common to both parties, frequently led to a noisy kind of artillery duel rarely bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>But when the rattling peals of musketry announced a serious engagement, the artillery of the volunteers, worthy rival of that of the regulars, would always rush across woods and swamps to seek a position where the danger was greatest, even at the risk of being abandoned by the raw troops who were its only support.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>We have dwelt upon the defects of the <rs>American</rs> volunteers because they were the cause of their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reverses, and because, in exposing them, we are only exalting the merit of those men who had so much to learn, in order to become capable of accomplishing the great task they had undertaken, and who succeeded by dint of perseverance and devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/><num value="1">One</num> trait in their character redeemed all these defects, and already displayed, under the garb <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> of these inexperienced men, those valiant champions who, at the end of the war, carried the enemy's strong works by assault: they went under fire more resolutely the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>Bad soldiers, if unconscious of the impression which the reality of war will produce upon them, are apt to rush into the fight with as much daring and resolution as veteran troops, and once engaged they will sometimes continue to behave well; but experience makes them timid, and their courage fails them afterwards, when called upon to face a danger they have learned to appreciate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>On the contrary, participation in those dangers, the loss of their comrades, the sufferings and hardships of the war, were to strengthen the courage and increase the self-possession of the volunteers whom a patriotic duty had taken from the occupations of civil life.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Let us therefore begin by casting a glance over the map of that vast country where, for the last half century, modern civilization, taking a marvellous flight, has developed itself amid the grandeurs, almost intact, of virgin Nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>What strikes the observer at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is the simplicity of the geographical configuration of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>We set aside the <rs>Pacific</rs> basin, which, closely connected with the other sections of the confederation by political and social affinities, is separated from them by the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs> and the plains which guard the approaches of that wild and desolate chain to the eastward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>Those spacious deserts, which the emigrant crosses without settling, envelop the new States, where he goes to seek his fortune, with a belt that is impassable for large armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>No great natural divisions are to be met between the foot of the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs> and the <rs>Atlantic</rs> borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> solitary range of mountains to be seen&mdash;that of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>, of great length, but deficient in altitude, extending from north-east to south-west, and consequently not presenting diversities of climate; intersected by numerous rivers of considerable size, divided throughout its whole extent by large and fertile valleys, <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> but without the snowy crown of the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> and the <placeName reg="Pyrenees" key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName>, and devoid, therefore, of all that can render a chain of mountains a real barrier and a political boundary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>The American rivers, slow and deep, easily navigable, instead of being an obstacle, are so many open highways for war as well as for commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>The general aspect of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, therefore, is grand and imposing, but singularly monotonous and uniform, and very different from that of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, where Nature and man have vied with each other in producing striking varieties of form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>It is easy to take in at <num value="1">one</num> glance the collective features of that country; but the details of its different parts are so much alike that the observer can with difficulty identify any of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>Under the artificial divisions of States and counties traced by rule and line across hundreds of leagues, where no historical associations exist, and which make a perfect checker-board of the map; between towns and villages whose names, by turns classical and vulgar, are so frequently repeated that they become a useless embarrassment to the memory, nothing can be distinguished but a network of water-courses more entangled than the blood-vessels of the human body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>It is a country possessing an even surface, with equal undulations throughout its whole extent, and covered with forests that collect the dampness and stock it in a multitude of valleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>Except among <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>, no clearly defined division of waters occurs, no large table-lands nor open spaces, no deep depressions, so that on nearing the <rs>Atlantic</rs> the level of the ground gradually lowers, until land and sea become interlaced; the smallest valleys are transformed into estuaries and the faintest undulations into long peninsulas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>It is not a part of our subject to point out the effect of this configuration upon the political condition of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Being without the long and bloody history of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and not divided between different races or hostile civilizations, she has not witnessed the formation of artificial frontiers upon her soil, to take the place of those natural divisions that are at variance with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>The same single people have spread over a uniform territory, and have everywhere implanted the same institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>And by a truly providential coincidence, the day when the immensity of her domain might have weakened the bonds of her unity, railways were introduced which averted the impending <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>It is wrong, therefore, to suppose that the extent of their territory is an obstacle in the way of their commercial development and a cause for political dissolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>But it is otherwise in a military point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>The distances, the nature of the country, and the condition of its settlements, interpose extraordinary difficulties to the great movements of armies and their manoeuvres on the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>The population is distributed very differently from what it is in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>While centuries of war, of violence, and oppression have concentrated the inhabitants of the Old World in cities and villages, peace, safety, and freedom have induced the settlers of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> to spread themselves over the surface of the country; and each of them settling down upon the patch of land which he has undertaken to clear with his individual resources, the rural families, instead of drawing near their neighbors and forming small straggling towns, have preferred an isolated country life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>Since then, immense cities have undoubtedly sprung up in the free States&mdash;not as a consequence of public danger, but, on the contrary, as the natural results of accumulated wealth and powerful commerce; but in the matter of social organization, these cities play a totally different part from that of our great <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> centres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>In <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> it is not the man from the country who goes to seek his fortune in the city; it is, on the contrary, the city people whom the hope of higher wages or of rapid profits draws into the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>Far from absorbing the vital forces of the nation, the city is only a vast reservoir from which they are poured over the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>Nor must it be forgotten that these great cities only exist in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>In the slave States, which have been the exclusive theatre of the war, prudence on <num value="1">one</num> side, the demands for field-labor on the other, caused the servile population to be distributed among the vast plantations of their respective masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>So that in those States there are neither large cities nor villages; small towns are scarce, the chief county place being designated by a solitary building, generally situated at the intersection of <num value="2">two</num> roads, and the <rs>Federal</rs> armies <pb id="p.200" n="200"/> had frequently to march for many long days without meeting with more than <num value="4">four</num> houses together in the same clearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>Essentially expansive in its tendencies, the population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, like a liquid which nothing can keep within bounds, has always spread itself over new tracts of land before it has completely settled those already occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>Thus, in the slave States this slight sprinkling of white population represented in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> less than <num value="6">six</num> inhabitants to every square kilometre and the proportion of cultivated lands to the entire surface of the territory was only <num value="0.1607">16.07 per cent.</num> in the South-eastern States and <num value="0.1017">10.17 per cent.</num> in those of the South-west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>During the <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> which followed the war of Independence, this proportion was scarcely increased, while during the same period of time, the total population of the <rs>Republic</rs> increased tenfold.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>To the natural difficulties which a too scanty population has not yet been able to overcome, there was added in the <rs>South</rs> the enervating influence of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>This fatal institution paralyzes that spirit of enterprise which, in the <rs>North</rs>, produces a striking contrast between the triumphs of industry and the splendors of a yet rebellious Nature only half conquered by civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>Turnpikes are few and poorly kept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>The roads, laid out at random from clearing to clearing, over a rich soil easily softened, become impassable at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rainfall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>Magnificent rivers roll their unexplored waters through the great shadows of the virgin forest, as in the days when the canoe of the <rs>Indian</rs> was gently wafted upon their currents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>There were no maps, or at least bad maps, which is even worse yet for the purposes of war. It appears that the drawings made by <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00200.00441" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> during the leisure hours of his youth still constitute the best topographical charts of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and the only States which possess correct drawings of land-surveys are those most recently admitted into the <rs>Union</rs>, which, as Territories, were for some time under the jurisdiction of the <rs>Federal</rs> government and surveyed by Federal officers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>Another capital difficulty in the way of military operations arose from the fact that the products of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, especially during the early stages of the war, were not adapted for the subsistence of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>The cotton-plant and the sugarcane reigned without rivals in the extreme <rs>South</rs>, and, more to the northward, tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> alone cultivated wheat to a great extent in the elevated valleys of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>, but like the neighboring <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">State of Kentucky</placeName>, her principal product was the slave himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>She took him out of her infamous pens to supply the sugar and cotton plantations, and to repair the ravages of forced labor and an insatiable climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>This interior traffic, which an odious application of the politico-economical principle of the relations between supply and demand had developed since the suppression of the <name>African</name> slave-trade, had by a just retaliation struck a death-blow to the prosperity of those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>The production and raising of slaves, to which everything was sacrificed, had ruined agriculture by multiplying the number of useless mouths, without increasing the number of strong arms, which were constantly being exported into other markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>Consequently, at the opening of the war, the <rs>Southern States</rs> depended entirely for their flour and salt meats upon enormous importations from the <rs>Western States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>The vast blockade in which the <rs>North</rs> held them shackled during the war compelled them at last to make their own soil yield them the necessary means for sustaining life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>Cotton, sugar, and tobacco, having lost their value, gave place to cereals, the cultivation of which, contrary to many predictions, spread and prospered as far as the warm plains of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>It was alone owing to this change in the cultivation of the soil that the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> were able to subsist, but, at the same time, it deprived the <rs>South</rs> of <num value="1">one</num> of her strongest defences, by rendering invasion easier.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>And yet <pb id="p.202" n="202"/> his example affords no proof that an army can subsist in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> upon the resources of the country it occupies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>It was only by avoiding all stoppages, by always marching on, and constantly occupying a new section of country, that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00202.00443" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> was able to get along for some time without the supplies forwarded from the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>When the large American armies, proportioned not to the density of the population, but to its entire number, found themselves, with all the requirements of a refined civilization, in the midst of a country yet so little cultivated, they encountered difficulties unknown in our <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> wars, and which <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00202.00444" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <persName n="Rochambeau,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00202.00445" reg="mostcommon:Rochambeau,nomatch:0"><surname>Rochambeau</surname></persName>, and <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> had formerly escaped, owing to the small number of their soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>The population is too limited to supply, out of its husbanded resources, the wants of such masses of men gathered together within a narrow space by the chances of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>We have shown that this population does not form any agglomerated centres, where the products of the country are naturally brought together, and where armies can easily obtain supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>The railways, which facilitate the circulation of such products and favor their exchange, have rendered depots where capital remains inactive&mdash;a thing always repugnant to an American&mdash;unnecessary, by carrying off at once all the fruits of the soil except what is strictly necessary for local consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>Armies, therefore, except under peculiar and fleeting circumstances, are obliged to draw the largest portion of their supplies from sections of country remote from the seat of war. To concentrate provisions in the quiet and productive districts, to have these provisions safely forwarded to the depots stationed <hi rend="italics">en echelon</hi> in the rear of the army, and by means of these depots to issue daily supplies to all the corps on their march,&mdash;such is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> requirement for conducting a campaign in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult problems which a general-in-chief has to solve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>The almost entire absence of turnpikes, the necessity of subjecting the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of tons of provisions consumed daily by a large army to such long and complicated transits, limits the transportation by wagons considerably, and renders the powerful assistance of steam indispensable both by water and by rail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>These fruitful arteries, which have permitted the concentration, <pb id="p.203" n="203"/> at different points, of the resources of an immense territory, and whose life-bearing current has alone been able to feed those artificial and unproductive masses of humanity called armies, are so important that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> died of inanition the very day it was deprived of their help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>Hence the decisive influence of the combined system of these river and iron highways upon the conduct of the war; it traced in advance, so to speak, the route of armies, and indicated the points the possession of which they contended for. It is important, therefore, to a proper understanding of the manner in which the war was conducted, that we should offer a few remarks regarding this system, notwithstanding the little attraction geographical descriptions possess in general.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>All travellers have vaunted the majesty of American rivers, but have failed to present an idea of their number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>These rivers penetrate the continent in every direction, and are navigable at all times for a certain distance; but when the rainy season comes, the shallows disappear, the smallest tributaries are rapidly swollen, extending the limits of navigation to the very heart of the <rs>Union</rs>, and opening thereby an easy way of access to the steamboats that have come from the remotest parts of the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>It is for this reason that the <rs>American</rs> journals always published a register of the water-marks of their great rivers as among the most important news-items of the war. The <name n="United States">American</name> steamboat, a huge flat-bottomed structure resembling a castle many stories high, with its strong engine and powerful wheels, can transport, in a single trip, enormous cargoes of provisions, ammunition, and even soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>An army <hi rend="italics">appuyee</hi> upon <num value="1">one</num> of these rivers can easily receive all the supplies it needs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>So long as it controls the waters its resources are unlimited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>Piers can easily be improvised from the forests which border the banks; upon this level highway no impediments are ever met with, no intermediate loadings or unloadings; the cargoes can be transported directly from the large cities of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> or <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> to the vicinity of the <rs>Federal</rs> camps on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee</placeName> or the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, a distance of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num> leagues from the point of departure.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>The whole system of water-courses in that vast region of country may be divided into <num value="2">two</num> parts, entirely distinct and separated by a long line, which, broken at a single point, extends from the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName> to those of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>Formed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by an insignificant chain of hills, this line runs from west to east, from the great river to a point south of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>; leaving this point, it follows the chain of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>, from south-west to north-east as far as the gap made by the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and to the boundary of the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>To the <name>south</name> and <name>south</name>-east of this great division, the waters flow directly into the sea, emptying either into the <rs>Atlantic</rs> or into the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>On the opposite slope, these waters rush from every point of the horizon to meet again in the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, that immense and only drainage of half a continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>This dividing line, uninterrupted by any water communication, proved a very serious obstacle throughout the entire war.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>The war we are about to describe has shown what great advantage <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> an army could derive from these rivers, especially when used in combination with railways; nor has the part of the latter been an unimportant <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>In those sections of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> which Nature has not supplied with navigable rivers, railways have been substituted to a certain extent, but they are far from possessing the same advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>More to eastward, the vast region of country comprised between the <rs>Ohio</rs> and <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>, already without navigable rivers, is also deprived of railways; it is the same with the section of country extending from the railway running <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> parallel with the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to the <rs type="place">Chattanooga gap</rs>, and separating the <rs>Ohio</rs> basin from that of the <rs type="place">Mexican Gulf</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>Consequently, the railways found in that part of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> which was the theatre of the war, form <num value="3">three</num> groups corresponding with the <num value="3">three</num> basins of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName> and the <rs>Ohio</rs> respectively.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>It is easy to conceive the bearing they had upon the war. They present, in fact, an insurmountable obstacle to the march of an army anxious to preserve its communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>From the vicinity of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to the borders of the <rs>Potomac</rs> they form <num value="1">one</num> continuous line, only once broken, in the centre, between <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> and <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>This was the weak point in the <rs>Southern</rs> armor which, after the loss of the <rs>Ohio</rs> basin, could have protected the heart of the rebel States, by compelling the <rs>Federals</rs> to attack them at either of the <num value="2">two</num> extremities, through the borders of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>, or by landing upon an inhospitable coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>It was through this flaw in the cuirass that we shall see <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00210.00450" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> thrusting his formidable sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>But at the time of which we are speaking, it was in the vicinity of the <rs>Ohio</rs> that the conflict was about to begin, and the division we have laid down in the network of rivers and railways will share in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> military operations in <num value="3">three</num> distinct zones, each of which will have the banks of <num value="1">one</num> of these rivers as the scene of action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>As we progress with our narrative, the very examples it furnishes will demonstrate more clearly than anything we could say in this place, the importance and the special use to be made of the ways of communication both by water and rail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>We shall therefore confine ourselves to a few words in justification of the <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> foregoing lengthy description, and to show that it was an indispensable introduction to the history of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>We shall see the rivers performing a double part in the strategic movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> hand, they secure unlimited resources for revictualling the armies, being accessible to an indefinite number of steamers, which can convey the supplies and reinforcements that are needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>On the other hand, they afford armies powerful means for assuming the offensive, by enabling ships of war to support their movements and protect their lines of communication in proportion as they are extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>Railways, on the contrary, with their limited capacity for transportation, are an instrument purely defensive; they cannot support the movements of an aggressor, who is obliged to regulate his march according to the greater or lesser rapidity with which they can be reconstructed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>The <num value="2">two</num> essential requisites, therefore, for directing the movements of an army are&mdash;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to secure a safe channel of transportation for its supplies, and then to know how far it can venture from the river or the railway by means of which those supplies are received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>Consequently, while in those countries that abound in provisions, like <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, an army extends its lines for the purpose of procuring sustenance, and concentrates to fight, in America, the larger the army, the greater the necessity for concentration in order to obtain provisions; because, being able to procure scarcely anything from the country it occupies, the more its lines are extended, the more difficult it becomes for those who are at a distance from their only sources of supply to procure food.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>In order to calculate the distance to which an army may venture from the depots established at the railway stations or river landings which constitute the base of its operations, we must begin by premising that there are no roads, in the <rs>European</rs> sense of the term, which can connect this base with the various positions occupied by the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>At the beginning of the war the <rs>American</rs> soldier consumed nearly <measure n="3l." type="pounds"><num value="3">three</num> pounds</measure> of food per day; if to this we add ammunition of every kind, personal accoutrements, and all that is necessary for the maintenance of troops, it will be readily admitted that the average weight of articles to be transported for the necessities of a large American army is about <measure n="4l." type="pounds"><num value="4">four</num> pounds</measure> daily to each man, without counting the food for horses and mules, which amounts to about <measure n="25l." type="pounds"><num value="25">twenty-five</num> pounds</measure> for each animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>The American wagon, drawn by <num value="6">six</num> mules, carries a load of <measure n="2000l." type="pounds"><num value="2000">2000</num> pounds</measure>, sufficient, therefore, to supply <num value="500">500</num> men, provided it can make the trip daily, going and returning, between the army and its depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>If the distance to be traveled is such as to require a whole day's march, <num value="1">one</num> day being lost in returning empty, it will only be able to supply <num value="500">500</num> men every other day, or <num value="250">250</num> daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>To go a distance of <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> march from its base of operations is a very small matter for an army that is manoeuvring in front of the enemy, and yet, according to this computation, it will require <num value="4">four</num> wagons to supply <num value="500">500</num> men with provisions, or <num value="8">eight</num> for <dateStruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></dateStruct>, and consequently <num value="800">800</num> for <num value="100000">100,000</num> men. If this army of <num value="100000">100,000</num> men has <num value="16000">16,000</num> cavalry and artillery horses, a small number comparatively speaking, <num value="200">200</num> more wagons will be required to carry their daily forage, and, therefore, <num value="800">800</num> to transport it to a distance of <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>These <dateStruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></dateStruct> wagons are, in their turn, drawn by <num value="9600">9600</num> mules, which, also consuming <measure n="25l." type="pounds"><num value="25">twenty-five</num> pounds</measure> during each of the <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> out of <num value="4">four</num> they are away from the depots, require <num value="360">360</num> wagons more to carry their forage; these <num value="360">360</num> wagons are drawn by <num value="2400">2400</num> animals, and in order to transport the food required by the latter, <num value="92">92</num> additional wagons are necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>Adding <num value="20">twenty</num> wagons more, for general purposes, we shall find that <num value="2000">2000</num> wagons, drawn by <num value="12000">12,000</num> animals, are strictly necessary to victual an army of <num value="100000">100,000</num> men and <num value="16000">16,000</num> horses at only <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> march from its base of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>In the same proportion, if <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> this army finds itself separated from its base of operations by <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> march, <num value="3760">3760</num> wagons, drawn by <num value="22000">22,000</num> animals, will be found indispensable for that service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>This calculation does not take into account the difficulties in the way of transportation; for if these wagons are necessary to convey the materials as far as the depots of the division, the others are required to distribute them afterwards among the regiments; an army, in fact, is obliged to keep a number of such wagons constantly with it in order to secure a certain degree of mobility and to be able to send a few detachments forward, accompanied by a wagon-train carrying several days' provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>Thus an American army of <num value="100000">100,000</num> men with nearly <num value="4000">4000</num> wagons, from <num value="2000">2000</num> to <num value="3000">3000</num> of which pass and repass over <num value="3">three</num> or four parallel roads, the distance of <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> march, or about <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> kilometres, had established for it, during the war, the .utmost distance to which it could venture from its base of operations, while continuing to receive its supplies from that source.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>In an offensive campaign, therefore, an army cannot go beyond <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> march without at the same time removing its depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>If it follows a line of railway, it must stop and wait for the repairing of the track as far as the new point where it wishes to establish them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>If its line of march lies contiguous to a river, it is generally accompanied by a fleet of transports, which, by reason of their flat bottoms, can be run upon any beach and their cargoes speedily landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>If it has to pass through a country deprived of easy communications, it may abandon the base of operations upon which it has rested and go in search of another; this apparently bold movement proved successful with all those who tried it, either for the purpose of striking the head of some railway already occupied by friendly troops, or for securing new positions on the margin of some distant river, where the fleet could again overtake the army and revictual it. By thus advancing its base of operations on the same line, or by changing from <num value="1">one</num> line to another, the wagons were relieved of <num value="2">two</num> trips; and by taking them along loaded with provisions, it doubled the number of days during which the troops could march in an enemy's country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>A certain number of rations in the haversack of each soldier increased the number of days, while herds of cattle, at the season of the <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> year when they could find pasturage in the vicinity of the army, afforded a supplementary resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>In proportion as he acquired experience in war, the <rs>Federal</rs> soldier became more sober, more sparing of his rations, and learnt at the same time to carry a heavier load on his shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>Among the necessary elements for calculating the number of days he could remain separated from his depots, there are some, as will be seen, which are essentially variable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>We shall confine ourselves, in regard to these, to the figures furnished by the experience of the same army at <num value="2">two</num> different epochs of the war. In <dateStruct value="1862-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00214.00451" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> being desirous to move his quarters from the head of <num value="1">one</num> line of railway to another, as we will show presently, with an army of <num value="122000">122,000</num> men&mdash;an operation which might oblige him to subsist for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> without any other supplies than those he carried with him,&mdash;these supplies were transported by a train of <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>These wagons were drawn by <num value="10980">10,980</num> animals; there were besides <num value="5046">5046</num> cavalry horses, and <num value="6836">6836</num> belonging to the artillery; in order to carry <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> complete rations of forage for these animals, it required a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> train, with an addition of <num value="17832">17,832</num> beasts, which had to supply the <num value="40664">40,664</num> horses or mules which in some capacity or other thus followed the army, with half rations, the country through which that army passed having to furnish the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>This enormous figure only comprised the transportation of provisions, exclusive of ammunition and of the sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>In <dateStruct value="1864-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, this same army was of nearly the same strength, numbering <num value="125000">125,000</num> men, <num value="29945">29,945</num> cavalry horses, and <num value="4046">4046</num> belonging to officers, <num value="4300">4300</num> wagons, and <num value="835">835</num> ambulances&mdash;<num value="56499">56,499</num> animals in all&mdash;when it took the field under the command of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00214.00452" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, prepared to fight and march for <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, if necessary, before rejoining any of its depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>The rations had been greatly diminished, and the soldiers were accustomed to carry heavy loads; they had <num value="3">three</num> full rations in their knapsacks and <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> allowance of biscuits in their haversacks; each wagon having capacity for <dateStruct value="1400--"><year reg="1400">1400</year></dateStruct> small rations, the train could furnish <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> provisions and forage, while the droves of beef-cattle that accompanied the army provided for <num value="3">three</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>So that, while <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00214.00453" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had only provisions for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> at the utmost, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> later, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00214.00454" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, with the same army and the same resources, was able to take with him <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> <measure n="16days" type="date">sixteen days</measure> supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>These figures fully show that experience in the war had succeeded in rendering certain operations possible which, in the beginning, were not so with the improvised troops whose <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaigns we are about to narrate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>The amount of transportation that can be effected by means of railways enters as a no less important element in the movements of armies, and will prove a source of embarrassment when those armies are large and depend upon a single line for their supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>Frequent examples of this will appear in our narrative; consequently, the organization of the railway service, and the skill with which all its details were regulated, contributed essentially to success during this difficult war. We will only cite <num value="1">one</num> instance at present&mdash;that of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00215.00455" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, <num value="23000">23,000</num> strong, which in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> was transported with all its <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi>, its horses and wagons, from the <rs>Rapidan</rs> to <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00215.00456" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,W.,G.,,:1"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, a distance of nearly <num value="2000">2000</num> kilometres, by rail in <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure>. This shows the great services railways were able to render by concentrating an army on any given point of the continent; but it was much easier to accomplish a movement of this kind than to supply a large army daily with provisions at the terminus of <num value="1">one</num> of those long single-track lines which run through the <rs>Southern States</rs>; in fact, their rude construction required constant repairs, and consequently occasioned frequent interruptions, so that beyond a certain distance, varying naturally according to circumstances, they were not sufficient to transport the required supply without the aid of another line, or, better still, of a river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>Naturally, the amount of transportation that could be made by water was only limited by the number of vessels at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>But, as we have said before, the rivers afford at once the best means for provisioning an army, and a powerful auxiliary for all offensive operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>We shall always find, therefore, that whenever the <rs>Federals</rs> were supported by a river, their progress was certain and their conquests decisive; whilst the successes they obtained by following a simple line of railways were always precarious, new dangers springing up in their rear in proportion as they advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>The revictualling of an army in sight of the enemy <pb id="p.216" n="216"/> by a fleet of transports, the bombardment of fortified places, constructed for the purpose of impeding navigation, and the naval battles fought upon the rivers will occupy so considerable a space in the history of this war, that the combined operations by land and water may be regarded as imparting to it an entirely distinctive character among all modern wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>The appellation of <hi rend="italics">fresh-water sailor</hi>, instead of being a term of contempt, should be in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> a mark of honorable distinction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>A few words at the conclusion of this chapter will suffice to convey an idea of the causes which imparted a strategic importance to certain points situated along the water-courses or line of railways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>The latter being everywhere vulnerable, and not admitting of defence by means of posts throughout their whole extent, it was found necessary to fortify stations at the intersection of several lines, chosen because they were the most convenient places for depots, and because whoever was in possession of them could at once intercept all the lines which crossed at such points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>The great American rivers, on the contrary, being never liable to obstruction, the most important points to occupy along their courses were those where it was most easy to erect batteries which could, by their fire, interrupt the navigation; these were generally the cliffs which rise in certain localities above the low flats which border nearly all the rivers of the new continent, for, from their height, they protected the batteries which crowned their summits, from the fire of gun-boats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>It will be seen, in short, that the most important points were those at which <num value="1">one</num> or more lines of railway crossed a navigable river or were arrested by its banks; for it was at such points that those immense supplies which were afterwards to be conveyed by rail to the armies in the interior were to arrive by water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>These <num value="2">two</num> modes of communication, which we may be pardoned for having dwelt upon at such length, were therefore so combined and perfected as to render possible the concentration of such armies as <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> had never before seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>Consequently, these armies could not separate themselves from these points of communication for any length of time &mdash; a singular circumstance which was to exercise a powerful and abiding influence on the war. <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> We have shown in advance how the combatants learnt by degrees to take the greatest possible advantage of these ways of communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>It will be seen a little later how dearly that experience cost them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>In reference to a civil war such as we are about to describe, this right was certainly unquestionable; the importance of that war rendered it incumbent upon them to prescribe and point out to their citizens the duties of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>The possession of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, with the exception of that portion which had been recaptured by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00254.00818" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, was secured to the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was beyond danger of any attack, and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was threatened anew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>We shall see the <rs>Federal</rs> government organize a powerful army within its capital; but its opponents, also taking advantage of the respite which the victory gave them, will increase their forces almost as rapidly, so as to keep those of the enemy <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> constantly in check; and they remained quiet during a period of <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> on the field of battle conquered on the <dateStruct value="-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>But it was chiefly through its moral effect that this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encounter was to exercise a powerful influence upon the war of which it was only the prelude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>The South saw in this victory a kind of ratification of her claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/>It was not only the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers who were vanquished on that day, but with them all who had remained more or less openly loyal to the <rs>Union</rs> in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>They had protested against a simple insurrection; but success imparted to the government of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00255.00819" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:13"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, in their estimation, an authority before which they all bowed; if a few secretly preserved their old attachment for the national flag, most of them fully submitted to the new power which had just achieved so complete a triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>None of the enemies of the great Republic any longer feared to express their sympathies for a cause which seemed to prosper, or to give it moral and material aid. It required at this moment an unbounded faith in the energy of the <rs>American</rs> people to refute the arguments of those who believed that their ruin was already consummated; most of the <rs>European</rs> governments, who should then have exacted from their citizens a strict observance of the duties of neutrality, allowed from that moment naval expeditions to be fitted out in their ports, which were to give such powerful aid to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>In short, this victory inspired the <rs>South</rs> with unlimited confidence in her own resources and the conviction that she could never be vanquished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>At the outset this conviction was a great element of success; it inspired her soldiers, already impressed with a sense of their superiority over their adversaries, with that daring which frequently determines the fate of battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>But at the same time it also rendered her improvident, and made her neglect many details the importance of which she felt too late; it prevented her, at this critical hour, from availing herself of all her resources, from calling together all able-bodied men, from organizing the interior defence of the <name>States</name>, which she thought could never be invaded; and, in this manner, it prepared the way for the disasters she met with in the <rs>West</rs> the following year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/>So that some of the military writers favorable to her cause have gone so far as to say that a defeat would have been more beneficial <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> to her than the victory to which she was indebted for this dangerous assurance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>This disaster, which might have discouraged the <rs>North</rs>, proved, on the contrary, a salutary lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>Far from dividing the <name>States</name> faithful to the <rs>Union</rs>, as the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders had anticipated, it only had the effect of stimulating their patriotism and of rendering them more clear-sighted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>At the news of the defeat, they appreciated at last the difficulty of the task they had undertaken, but they never shrank from it. They understood that in order to obtain success in a great war, it is not sufficient to have a great number of soldiers&mdash;it is necessary that they should be well trained; that armies are complicated machines which require as much science as care in their construction, and that if popular enthusiasm and personal courage supply its materials, it requires discipline to combine them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>From that day the <rs>North</rs> submitted patiently and with determination of purpose to all that was required to organize her forces and to put them in a condition to undertake long and fatiguing campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>Although the soldiers composing the national armies still bear the name of volunteers, the aim of all their efforts will henceforth be to acquire that instruction and that experience which cause the superiority of regular troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>The improvised generals will give place to those who are brought up in the military career; the officers who seriously try to learn their profession will be greatly encouraged by the confidence of the public and of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>It is not, therefore, to this American democracy, which is essentially practical and profits by experience, that the partisans of levies <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> and improvised armies must look for confirmation of their theories.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/><emph>I</emph>N the midst of the excitement that prevailed in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> on the mournful day of <dateStruct value="-07-22"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, Congress set an example of courage to the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>While the remnants of the army defeated on the previous day were beginning to crowd the streets of the capital, and everybody looked at <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Washington, Ohio" key="tgn,2137138">Arlington Heights</placeName> with a feeling of uneasiness, expecting to see the enemy's artillery make its appearance, and while the military chiefs were endeavoring to reorganize their respective forces, the two Houses assembled at the <rs>Capitol</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>Grief was portrayed on every countenance, but it had not destroyed the determination of those who supported the <rs>President</rs>'s policy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>A few days before they had responded to his call for a levy of <num value="400000">400,000</num> volunteers and the issue of <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">four hundred million dollars</measure> for their support, by a resolution increasing both these numbers and authorizing the enlistment of <num value="500000">500,000</num> volunteers and an expenditure of <measure n="500000000dollars" type="currency">five hundred million dollars</measure>. This resolution was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> presented in the <name>Senate</name> on the <dateStruct value="-07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and on the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/>But the amendments introduced by the partisans of peace-at-any-price, who were allowed a perfect freedom of speech, and who desired to prevent the <rs>President</rs> from employing these resources to put down the rebellion, had delayed the final vote on the resolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>By a singular coincidence, this debate had been fixed for the <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, when the impending disaster was scarcely contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>This disaster, so far from embarrassing the debate, only served to impart to it a peculiar solemnity, and the eagerness with which the resolution was passed showed that the representatives of the <rs>American</rs> people fully appreciated the duties devolved upon them by such grave circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>The <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> had often been the hot-bed of miserable <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> intrigues; this is a reproach which attaches not only to all political assemblies, but to every human power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>By their impatience and unseasonable interference in military matters, they sometimes jeopardized success; but to make up for this they gave to the nation, at every critical period of the war, the example of perseverance, and manifested that true patriotism which is stimulated more by defeat than by victory, and which after each reverse resolutely imposes upon itself new and heavier sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>If the check of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> demonstrated the inexperience of the <rs>American</rs> soldiers, it also proved that the people to whom they belonged possessed that manly temperament which gathers strength from adversity, and that constancy which, after many delays and fruitless efforts, succeeded at last in rendering available resources ignored by their adversaries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>It is an error, we believe, to attribute the honor of this quality exclusively to the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00258.00820" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race; we should rather attribute it to the working of free institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>A people living under such institutions do not prepare for war after the manner of conspirators; hence the frequent checks that are experienced at the outset; but they profit by experience, their courage increases in proportion to the magnitude of the struggle, they persevere in it because they have voluntarily assumed its responsibilities, and every citizen, making it a personal matter, sustains the common cause with a zeal which develops the national strength at the very moment when a despotic government would already have been struck powerless before a wearied and unsympathizing public.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>Hence it is that the creation of those large armies which carried the national flag during a period of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> dates from the <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>The imperfect organization which united the heterogeneous elements led by <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00258.00821" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> to the field of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> had not been able to withstand the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shock, and his army had melted away like a lump of ice before the fire of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>On that day all <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> understood that an army cannot subsist and move about like an individual; that there should be, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, an active and educated staff to regulate its movements&mdash;on the other hand, an experienced administrative department to provide for its daily wants; and that without these appliances it becomes an inert and lifeless body in the hands of the ablest <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>The people learned that it was not sufficient to have placed <num value="500000">500,000</num> men at the disposal of the <rs>President</rs>, but that it was necessary to aid him in converting those men into soldiers; they cast aside all their prejudices and gave up all their illusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/><q direct="unspecified">Drill and organize</q> was the watchword on every lip. Instead of casting a stone at the regular officers who had had the misfortune of being vanquished, but who had bravely performed their duty, justice was meted out to them, and they were entrusted with the task of repairing the disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>Almost all the principal commands in the <rs>Federal</rs> army were bestowed upon them, and the <name>States</name> contended for the privilege of confiding the new regiments that were being organized to these officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>Nay more, their advice, when they asked the country to renounce that fatal impatience which had brought on the <rs type="place">Bull Run</rs> campaign, was listened to, and public opinion accepted without a murmur the long inaction which was deemed necessary to organize the national forces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>This inaction, which lasted until the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, was interrupted from time to time only by combats of little importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>The principal occupation of the chiefs of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies during the <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> succeeding the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs> was to prepare the instruments they were to use at a later period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>The order of our narrative itself, therefore, leads us to say a few words in this place concerning the great task they had to accomplish before they could take the field in earnest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>The most important thing to be done was to reconstruct the army which had been beaten at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>. <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0321.0005.00259.00822" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was summoned in great haste on the <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00259.00823" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and entrusted with this duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/><persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00259.00824" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, who had been offered an independent command in the <rs>West</rs>, preferred to remain at the head of a simple division among the companions of his defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0321.0005.00259.00825" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had made himself known by the successful and rapid campaign which <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> before had freed <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>, but he happily possessed also organizing talents which he had not been able to display in that small command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>His laborious character, his precise, methodical mind, and his vast military knowledge peculiarly fitted him for the ungrateful and difficult work which had fallen to his lot. He was <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> the creator of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>&mdash;of that army placed at the most vulnerable point, which, although paralyzed by the necessity of covering the capital, served as the principal pivot of military operations; that army which, often unfortunate, was never discouraged, and was rewarded at the end of the struggle by attaining the honor of striking the decisive blow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>In the <rs>Western States</rs>, the war, which was only a continuation of the quarrel, already often a bloody <num value="1">one</num>, between abolitionists and pro-slavery men, had been carried on until then from town to town, from farm to farm, and from man to man, according to the old-fashioned mode of fighting&mdash;a civil war <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>, as indecisive as it was bitter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>But, in order to obtain important results in those vast regions, it was necessary to undertake much longer campaigns than in the <rs>East</rs>, where the vicinity of hostile capitals placed the <num value="2">two</num> opponents forcibly face to face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>It was therefore still more important that the armies destined to operate in that quarter should receive the organization without which they could not move over great distances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>These armies, which the volunteers from the <rs>Western States</rs> swelled so rapidly, contained a large number of stalwart men, better inured to hardships than those of the <rs>East</rs>, but they were poorer in materials of war than the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, which was within reach of the principal arsenals and the industrial cities of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>Before describing the slow organization of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces which preceded the serious resumption of hostilities, we hasten to remark that the <rs>Confederates</rs> were the unwilling accomplices in that inaction which enabled their adversaries to make their preparations at leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>The opportunity of marching upon <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> the day following their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victory having once been suffered to slip, the commonest prudence compelled them to remain in the defensive attitude which had been the cause of their success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>If the <rs>Federals</rs> had been confronted by an enemy better prepared to take the offensive, neither patriotism nor the number of their soldiers would have been of any avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>This is a consideration which Europeans, whose States are surrounded by powerfully armed neighbors, should never lose sight of when they study the manner in which <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, after having been <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> taken unawares, was able to improvise her large armies of volunteers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>We may be permitted to recall here a personal reminiscence showing how different were the circumstances which alone favored the formation of these armies, from those presented in the wars of which our continent is too often the theatre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>The author arrived in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and had the honor to enter the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> after the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>Not a musket-shot had been exchanged during that time between the <num value="2">two</num> hostile forces, which in the mean while watched each other a short distance apart between <placeName reg="Arlington, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7015769">Arlington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-house">Fairfax Court-house</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2577"/>A balloon in the service of the army rose every evening to reconnoitre the surrounding country; an ascension was proposed and accepted; it was then the only means of seeing the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/>Scarcely had we risen above the ancient trees which surround the former residence of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0321.0005.00261.00826" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, when the prospect was extended over an undulating yet uniform country covered with woods, spotted here and there with small clearings, and bounded on the west by the long chain of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, which recalls to mind the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lines of the <name>Jura</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2579"/>Thanks to the brilliant light which illumines the last hours of an autumn day in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, the observer can distinguish the smallest details of the country beneath him like a plan in relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2580"/>But his eye seeks in vain for apparent signs of war; peace and tranquillity seemed to reign everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2581"/>It requires all his attention to detect some recent clearings, at the edge of which a line of reddish earth indicates the new fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>Meanwhile, as the day sinks, he sees at the southward small fleeces of bluish smoke breaking gently above the trees; they are multiplied by groups in a vast semicircle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>These are the <rs>Confederates</rs> cooking their soup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>The number of their army can almost be counted, for each line of smoke betrays the kettle of a platoon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>Further in the distance the vapor of a locomotive rushing toward the mountains traces by its wake above the trees the line by which the enemy is provisioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>At the same moment a military band is heard directly under the balloon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>All the clearings in which we have sought in vain to discover the <rs>Federal</rs> <pb id="p.262" n="262"/> camps are filled with a crowd issuing from the surrounding woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>This crowd falls into line and forms battalions, the band passing before the ranks with that peculiar gait which the <rs>English</rs> have denominated <q direct="unspecified">goose-step.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>Each regiment has <num value="2">two</num> flags&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> being the national colors, the other bearing the device of the <rs>State</rs> to which it belongs, together with its regimental number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>These flags are lowered; the officers salute; the colonel takes the command; and a moment after the soldiers all disperse, for it is neither a surprise nor the prelude of a forward march which has thus called them together, but the ordinary <q direct="unspecified">evening parade.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/></p> 
<p>It was in the midst of this absolute calm that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0321.0005.00262.00827" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> organized the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>Congress on the <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> had correctly expressed the sentiments which animated the entire <rs>North</rs> at the news of <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00262.00828" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>'s defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>The loyal States understood at last the magnitude of the undertaking they had before them, and determined to neglect nothing that could compass its success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>Everybody set to work; patriotic donations flowed in; subscription funds were opened for the benefit of the soldiers; women manifested as much zeal to induce men to enlist as in the <rs>South</rs>; the largest iron mills in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were turned into cannon foundries or into outfitting establishments; finally, enlistments became more and more numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/>The <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> volunteers raised on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call of <dateStruct value="-04-15"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="15">15th</day></dateStruct> were discharged, but a great many of them re-enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2596"/>Those who had responded to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> call of <dateStruct value="-05-4"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="4">4th</day></dateStruct>, instead of the <num value="40">forty</num> battalions asked for, already formed <num value="208">208</num> battalions on the <dateStruct value="-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2597"/>In order to complete the effective force of <num value="250000">250,000</num> men authorized by Congress, it was only necessary to encourage this movement and to receive into the service of the <rs>Union</rs> all the new battalions thus created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>We have already described the manner in which they were recruited and organized in each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2599"/>As soon as they were received into the <rs>Federal</rs> service by the mustering-officer, who had charge of the registry, they were forwarded to the armies of the <rs>West</rs> or to the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, which were rather vast camps of instruction than armies in the field; and as soon as they were able to defile without too much confusion they were formed into brigades <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> battalions somewhat less inexperienced than themselves, whose example could be of use to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2600"/>The interior organization of the armies thus formed was modelled precisely upon that of the old regular army, which we have described elsewhere in full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2601"/>The duties pertaining to the various branches of the service were distributed in the same way, and this old army ceased to have a separate existence except in the annual Army Register.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>It saw its administrative departments, with their <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi>, blended with those that had been created for the army of volunteers; it saw the majority of its officers enter that army with new rank, and its infantry and cavalry regiments, together with its batteries, were scattered among the various armies and formed into divisions with the volunteers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>The appointment of all generals, their aides-de-camp, and all the officers and employes of the administrative departments belonged to the <rs>President</rs>, subject to the confirmation of the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>But the rank thus conferred was merely temporary, and expired by limitation on the disbandment of the volunteer armies for whose special wants they had been created.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing required was the appointment of a certain number of generals to assume the commands indispensable to such a large assemblage of troops; for the regular army only contained about a dozen, nearly all new, and yet <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> among them too much disabled to take the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>In the staffs of the armies in the field the chiefs of the different services were regular officers, invested with a rank commensurate with the importance of their functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>Thus, for instance, a regiment recently encamped received its rations in flour, and for want of cooking utensils found itself, in fact, without food, whilst biscuits were distributed to its neighbor, which, being provided with portable ovens, might have contributed through them to relieve the common wants to a considerable extent.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>An exception should be made in favor of the medical branch of the service; for, if officers were scarce, physicians before the war were numerous, America being the country which, in proportion to her population, possesses the greatest number of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>The spirit of personal independence and the absence of all control on the part of the state, so far from being detrimental to the cause of medical science in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>, has given it an extraordinary impulse; and the <rs>Americans</rs> quote with just pride, besides such names as those of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00266.00843" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mott,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00266.00844" reg="mostcommon:Mott,nomatch:0"><surname>Mott</surname></persName>, the reports of their principal surgeons relative to the innumerable experiments which the war enabled them to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>The progress of medical science resulting from these reports may perhaps afford some compensation to humanity for all the blood shed during that cruel war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>The composition of the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of an army, notwithstanding its importance, is not, however, either the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> element of military organizations or the most difficult to create: the most important is discipline, that moral force without which no army can exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/>When it is established by tradition the new-comers submit to it without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>But the <rs>Federal</rs> government had not only to introduce it among a vast multitude of men, all equally strangers to its severe requirements, but it did not possess any really effective means to enforce respect for it. In the first place, if the government had the right to deprive officers of their rank, it had not the power to replace them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>It could only punish regimental officers by dismissing them, and had no rewards to offer them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>The States, fearing lest the <rs>Federal</rs> government should possess too much influence, had, in refusing the right of appointment and promotion, deprived it of the best guarantee of good service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>On the other hand, there being no rule in force regulating the promotion of officers appointed by the <name>States</name> and enrolled <pb id="p.267" n="267"/> in the service of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, or in the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> of the army of volunteers, and the latter being considered as a merely temporary organization, discipline could not find that support which the respect inspired by a strongly constituted hierarchy obtained for it in permanent armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>We have already stated how the ranks were distributed among those who had mostly contributed to the recruiting of regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>But among those who thus attained the summit of the ladder at the outset there were some who voluntarily descended it just as quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>More than <num value="1">one</num> subaltern officer of the regular army, placed in command of a regiment with the rank of colonel, became disgusted with that position and went to resume a modest place in his old company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>There were others who, having held no previous rank in the standing army, had to undergo even greater trials; and we might mention a few instances of officers who, after leaving <num value="1">one</num> regiment in order to assume the position of colonel in another, found themselves reduced to the ranks by the disbanding of the latter, and returned to take their places as common soldiers in their former regiment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>But the most serious obstacle against the maintenance of discipline was to be found in the law which, by an inexcusable anomaly in a democratic country, conferred upon the chiefs a discretionary authority over the soldiers for the punishment of simple military misdemeanors, and did not permit them to exercise the same in regard to officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>The latter had to be tried by courtmartial for the slightest infringement of military rules, and they could not be subject to <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> confinement without a formal sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>In consequence of this system, borrowed from the regular army, upon which it had been grafted in days when the executive power was mistrusted, the trial, the prosecution and the defence&mdash;in short, all the guarantees required by law in cases of grave offences&mdash;became a parody to secure immunity for the officers accused of insubordination towards their superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>All these difficulties, however, did not discourage those who had undertaken the organization of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies, and they succeeded at last in introducing order and discipline among them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>The rules established for determining the right to a command <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> being as precise and as scrupulously observed in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> as in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, served as a corrective to the accidents which converted the superior officer of to-day into a subordinate of to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>These rules assigned the command among officers of the same grade to the senior of those who held their commissions from the <rs>President</rs>, whether they belonged to the regular army or to the volunteer staff, in preference to those who had been appointed by the governors of States, in special contingents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>With regard to the law instituting courts-martial to pronounce upon the slightest breaches of discipline, it met with the fate of all laws that are too bad to be applied; a <num value="1000">thousand</num> ways were found to evade it. The officer who neglected his duty was placed under arrest, as if to prepare for trial, and at the end of <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure> he was released and told that the matter should not be pursued any further&mdash;a decision in which he naturally hastened to acquiesce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>Or in more serious cases he was to be put in arrest for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> within his tent, and warned that if he made any complaints against such illegal proceeding the <rs>President</rs> would be requested to dismiss him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>Being thus relieved from matters of which they should never have taken cognizance, the courts-martial had yet another laborious duty to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>Their functions were of a double character, according to the gravity of the charges brought before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>As simple courts they recommended the <rs>President</rs> to suspend or dismiss the party accused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>As military tribunals, invested by the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself with judiciary power to try special cases, they imposed pecuniary fines and corporal penalties extending even to death, such sentences being subject to the revision of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>In these courts-martial the volunteers were tried by volunteers, the regulars by regulars; but they were all subject to the same military code, the <rs>Articles</rs> of War, a small collection, rather vague, which, like nearly all Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00268.00845" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> laws, leave a great deal to jurisprudence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>The establishment of examining commissions operated largely in favor of discipline, and raised the dignity of the epaulette in the estimation of the soldiers by purging the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the list of officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>It was impossible to confer all the ranks upon educated officers, as there were very few such; but all the <pb id="p.269" n="269"/> others could be divided into <num value="2">two</num> classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, who were by far the most numerous, being conscious of their deficiencies, desired to improve themselves, and had all the intelligence necessary for learning their profession even in the midst of the difficulties of the war; such must be retained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>The others, as presumptuous as they were incapable, set a fatal example in the positions they had courted only to gratify their cupidity or vanity; the examining commissions were directed to rid the army of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>They were instructed to subject all the officers of the various contingents to a rigid examination before they were finally accepted by the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>These examinations only took place several months after those contingents had been formed into divisions, so that the generals who had them under their respective commands were able to furnish the commissioners with suggestions in regard to the officers about to be examined, which more or less controlled their decisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>The examiners always favored those who were known to be disposed to learn their profession, but those convicted of downright ignorance had no mercy shown to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>During the early stages of the war, those who found themselves thus deprived of their rank begged for favor, threw themselves at the feet of their judges; for, apart from the disgrace, it was a great pecuniary loss to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2654"/>They were told in reply to go and learn, and a few rigorous examples determined a large number of officers to avoid the disgrace of failure at a public examination in the presence of their comrades and their subordinates by a prompt resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>This summary mode of proceeding may have caused some injustice, but the most cruel injustice would have been to expose the lives of soldiers by allowing the army to be filled with men incapable of commanding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>It was thus that discipline and respect for authority began to take root in the army, and their salutary influence was soon felt, although the observer, judging only from appearances, might not yet have been able to realize the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>Indeed, what may be called the hierarchical sentiment has never existed in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, where the uncertain rounds of the social ladder offer to no <num value="1">one</num> a pedestal so high but that a man may descend from it without ruin, where the citizen who has deserved well of his <pb id="p.270" n="270"/> country in a high position does not think it derogatory to his dignity to serve that country in a more modest capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>Even in the regular army the rank which, acquired with difficulty, had been the aim and the reward of a whole career has never elicited the same respect as amongst us. The power it confers, the obedience it ought to secure within the limits of military command, lost nothing thereby, but it did not of itself create those social distinctions which are carefully kept up elsewhere, even by persons occupying inferior positions with the secret hope of being able at some future day to take the places of their superiors and to receive the same marks of respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2659"/>In the volunteer army, for stronger reasons, no prestige could attach to the mere <hi rend="italics">epaulette</hi>, for the soldier was the more able to criticise the ignorance of his immediate chiefs because he almost always belonged to the same county or village and had long known them personally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2660"/>The absence of that moral authority which is based upon length of service and superior experience was still more unfortunate among the non-commissioned officers, to whom it was even more indispensable in order to enforce obedience from the soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2661"/>But, on the other hand, the intelligence and education which lifted most of the privates to a level with their superiors inspired them with a natural respect for those among their chiefs in whom they recognized the necessary qualities for command, and induced them to accept, without a murmur, the obligations and restraints of military life when they were made to understand the necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2662"/>Leaving the entire monopoly of insubordination to a few regiments, mostly composed of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> adventurers, they exhibited none of that turbulence which is frequently associated with the name of volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2663"/>A few words of caution were sufficient to remind them that, having once taken the oath, there were no longer <hi rend="italics">amateurs</hi> in the ranks of the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2664"/>During the whole period of organization in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0321.0005.00270.00846" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had but once an occasion to rebuke any attempt to resist his authority This occurred shortly after the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs>, the memories of which had not yet been effaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2665"/>The soldiers of a volunteer regiment, considering themselves aggrieved in a matter affecting their pay and term of enlistment, refused to obey their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2666"/>Their camp, situated <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> on <num value="1">one</num> of the squares of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, was immediately surrounded by a detachment of regular troops, infantry and artillery, and this display of force sufficed to bring them to obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>In granting them pardon the general-in-chief took away their flag, with the promise to return it to them on the field of battle; and the zeal which these troops displayed to atone for their error soon made them <num value="1">one</num> of the best regiments in the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>The acts of severity necessary for the maintenance of discipline were generally approved by public opinion, which was determined to sustain the authority of the chiefs from whom they expected the salvation of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>But it was repugnant to the <rs>American</rs> people to shed, even by judicial process, the blood of a guilty man when that of a victim did not cry for vengeance; and to render possible the execution of deserters to the enemy it was necessary to bring forward material proof of the great danger to which the army was exposed if capital punishment, that indispensable penalty of the military code, was not inflicted upon traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> execution took place in <dateStruct value="1861-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; it was an event in the <rs>Federal</rs> army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>The best example that can be given of the docility with which the volunteers submitted to all the regulations, the necessity or advantages of which they understood, is to be found in the manner in which the absolute prohibition of fermented liquors was accepted by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>In a country where the use of ardent spirits is so universal, where the bar-room or drinking-shop plays so great a part, so severe a restriction could not have been imposed upon the soldiers if nearly all of them had not cheerfully recognized its necessity with a firmness of purpose more meritorious than many acts of heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>The commissaries of subsistence alone had in store a detestable brandy distilled from grain, which they distributed parsimoniously to the sick and to the soldiers employed at hard labor, or to those encamped in malarious localities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>It is true that during the early stages of the war the low drinking-shops of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> were crowded with soldiers whose trembling hands brandished the terrible bowieknife, or who staggered to the sidewalk to end their quarrels with the revolver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>But it may be asserted that no drunken man was ever seen in camp; and even in the cities these disorders ceased as <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> soon as the military police, better organized, prevented soldiers from leaving their tents to visit &mdash; the bar-rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>The sutlers, licensed smugglers, were subjected to the supervision of the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs>, and no strong liquor was tolerated at their stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>It was the <name>Europeans</name> who most strongly resisted this regulation&mdash;the <name>Germans</name> from pure loyalty to their <hi rend="italics">lager-bier</hi>, the <name>Southerners</name> to drink in secret an alcoholic compound which in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> is called brandy (whisky).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>The <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of staffs and administrative departments being once organized and that of the contingents purified, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> principles of discipline established among the officers, as well as among the soldiers, the great task of drilling the army had yet hardly begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>Indeed, a great assemblage of men resembles a statue of clay, unable to move without breaking and having no vital breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>This task was the more difficult in the <rs>American</rs> army because instruction was as necessary for the officers as for the men, and because the latter, having no example to encourage them, did not understand the utility of so long an apprenticeship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>Their intelligence, however, which rendered them submissive to the voice of chiefs really worthy to command them, soon made them undertake it with ardor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>Full of confidence in themselves, they made up their minds, not that it was useless to learn, but that it would be very easy for them to learn anything they wished, the trade of war as well as any other; having enlisted voluntarily, they were determined to do everything in their power to become good soldiers capable of victory.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>They were, therefore, of as much value as their chiefs, whose examples exercised an all-powerful influence over the collective spirit, if we may use such an expression, which animates a body of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>A rapid change took place in those regiments in which the superior officers went assiduously to work and began by learning themselves what they desired to teach their inferiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>This number would have been excessive in a standing army, but at a time when it was necessary to organize everything it offered great advantages; for there were many chances that among these <num value="3">three</num> officers <num value="1">one</num> would be found capable of assuming the management of affairs in the regiment, whatever his rank; his superiority over his <num value="2">two</num> colleagues very soon placed the direction of affairs in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>Most of these officers applied themselves with zeal to the novel task they had accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>Very often, after a day of drill and manoeuvres, when the soldier was resting without care, the colonel would call all his officers together in his tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>There, by the light of an unsteady lamp, he would lecture them upon certain manoeuvres, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the capacity of teacher, then freely discuss with them sundry points in tactics; and when the latter had retired, he would still continue to study, with his lieutenant-colonel and major, the <rs>French</rs> regulations (infantry tactics), translated by <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00273.00847" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>, in order to expound them on the following day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most important duties in the organization of the army, and the most difficult to have well performed, was the management of regimental accounts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>In the absence of an administrative staff the keeping of these accounts devolved entirely upon the colonel and captains of companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>For those who had not been engaged in mercantile affairs it was a labyrinth from which they could not extricate themselves without close application; and <num value="1">one</num> should have inspected some of the <rs>American</rs> regiments in person in order to form an idea of the worriments entailed upon <num value="1000">thousands</num> of officers by the necessity of keeping <num value="4">four</num> official account-books in order&mdash;the descriptive-book, the morningreturn-book, the account-book, and the order-book.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>In all the details we have given concerning the formation and organization of volunteer regiments we have said nothing of the measures taken to fill the gaps occasioned by sickness and the bullets of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>The fact is that such measures had not been deemed necessary at the outset of a war which it was thought would only last <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>. It was soon found that when a regiment had once set out to join the army, nobody any longer applied to the recruiting depots; the good places had been taken; <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> the men of influence who had contributed to the formation of the regiments were in camp; and if others appealed in their turn to the public, it was in behalf of new regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>Under such a system it was impossible to establish depots; the numerical strength of the regiments was greatly diminished during their stay in camps, and it only required a single battle or a few nights passed in a malarious locality to reduce them to skeletons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>In the mean while, the new levies which swelled the ranks of the armies brought no direct reinforcement to those regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>In order to procure a rapid supply of men it was necessary constantly to create new regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>These regiments brought with them all the inexperience which had cost so dear to their predecessors, without deriving any profit from the experience acquired by the latter, while the number of officers and soldiers belonging to the old regiments, whose example and teachings might have been so useful to the new comers if they had been thrown together under the same colonels, was too much reduced to play an important part unaided in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>It may be that in trying to remedy this evil the source itself had been exhausted from which the ranks of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies had been filled when they were so fearfully decimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>But this system was <num value="1">one</num> of the principal causes of their weakness, and its consequences became more and more injurious until the day when, the conscrption law having at last given the <rs>Federal</rs> government the means for securing enlistments, the formation of new regiments was prohibited, and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0321.0005.00274.00848" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> infused new vigor into the army by the consolidation of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> regiments into <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>Such was the general condition of affairs in the midst of which the organization of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies was being effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>Each branch of the service was naturally organized and perfected with more or less rapidity according to the particular difficulties that this labor expects to encounter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>In the infantry the soldiers were vigorous, but did not understand how to husband their strength for a long march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>They did not know how to buckle on their knapsacks; they clumsily carried very light weights on their shoulders; they had no idea how to take care of their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>Most of them were bad marksmen when they enlisted, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> muskets which were put in their <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> hands were so defective that they could not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> practice at a target.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>The infantry regiments, modelled upon those of the regular army, were composed of <num value="10">ten</num> companies, each having a nominal strength of <num value="96">ninety-six</num> men, <num value="1">one</num> captain, <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">first lieutenant</rs>, and <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-2">second lieutenant</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>It was upon these <num value="10">ten</num> companies, formed in <num value="2">two</num> ranks, that all the manoeuvres by battalion were based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>The artillery branch of the service was especially in favor with the <rs>American</rs> volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/>It suited their taste for the mechanical arts, and they felt, moreover, like all new soldiers, a certain degree of confidence on finding themselves near those powerful weapons, with a longer range than musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>In short, the <orgName n="Regular Artillery" type="artillery">regular artillery</orgName>, having always been very numerous, supplied the volunteers with a proportionally larger number of able instructors than any other arm. Consequently, in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0321.0005.00275.00849" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was able to supply each division with a regular battery destined to serve as a model for the others, and the captain of which exercised a superior command over the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>We shall speak presently of the material they had in their hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>The <orgName n="Volunteer Artillery" type="artillery">volunteer artillery</orgName>, furnished by the several States, was only organized into batteries, having no officer above the rank of captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>The superior officers of that arm of the service all belonged to the regular army, or had received from the <rs>President</rs> a temporary rank, with the title of aides-de-camp, on the staff of the general commanding the corps to which they were attached.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>The cavalry was slower in acquiring the knowledge which alone could render it really useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>It required the experience of several campaigns to enable them to learn fully the special part which the nature of the country imposed upon them, and to exercise a serious influence upon the military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>The strength of the volunteer regiments of cavalry varied according to the <name>States</name> which furnished them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>Some of them, following the example of the new regular regiments, numbered as many as <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> horses, and the <num value="3">three</num> majors had each a command of <num value="4">four</num> squadrons or companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>Most of them, however, formed upon the old model, were composed of <num value="10">ten</num> companies, each about <num value="100">one hundred</num> strong, without any intermediate field-officer between the colonel and the captains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>These regiments, of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> horses each, presented a front too extended for the word of command, <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> thereby increasing the difficulties of drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>These difficulties were great and numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>The men arrived on foot; it was the duty of the <rs>Federal</rs> government to equip and mount them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>The duties of horsemen were new to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>The North American had lost some of the good traditions of horsemanship pertaining to the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00850" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>In the eastern part of the <rs>Union</rs> the saddle-horse has been supplanted by the light vehicle called <q direct="unspecified">buggy;</q> in the <rs>West</rs> the farmer is more of a husbandman than a stockraiser; and the pioneer of the border States relies only upon his rifle to contend with mounted <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00851" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>Nevertheless, these regiments were generally very popular among the volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>Forgetting that the mounted man has to be the slave of his horse, they thought that because they could perform a day's march on horseback less labor would be required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>The number of cavalry regiments increased to such a degree that, in order to curtail the useless expense imposed upon the treasury, it was found necessary to leave a portion of the men dismounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>We shall show hereafter, when we shall have occasion to speak of the <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> of war, how fearfully horses were used up by the cavalry regiments during the early stages of the war. Owing to ignorance of the care necessary to preserve the animals, the soldiers found themselves dismounted after a few days' campaign, and even obliged to go into cantonments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>This was the principal cause of the protracted inefficiency of the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>Besides, the difference between the regiments commanded by an experienced colonel and those whose chiefs were ignorant of their profession was, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, even greater in the cavalry than in the infantry; and officers like <persName n="Averill,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00852" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><surname>Averill</surname></persName>, <persName n="Gregg,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00853" reg="mostcommon:Gregg,nomatch:0"><surname>Gregg</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buford,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00854" reg="mostcommon:Buford,nomatch:0"><surname>Buford</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Farnsworth,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00855" reg="mostcommon:Farnsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Farnsworth</surname></persName> in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00856" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, <persName n="Kautz,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00857" reg="mostcommon:Kautz,nomatch:0"><surname>Kautz</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00276.00858" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> in the <rs>West</rs>, who subsequently achieved so much distinction, became at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> noted for the excellent condition of the cavalry troops placed under their respective commands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>The division formation of these various arms was effected in a nearly uniform manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>In the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> <num value="4">four</num> regiments, or battalions, constituted a brigade, with an effective force of from <num value="3200">3200</num> to <num value="3500">3500</num> men on taking the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>A division was composed of <num value="3">three</num> brigades of infantry, <num value="1">one</num> regiment of cavalry, and <num value="4">four</num> batteries of artillery, <num value="1">one</num> of which belonged to the <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> regular service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>The surplus of cavalry and artillery remained separate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>The special services found great resource in the aptitude of the <rs>American</rs> to pass from <num value="1">one</num> trade to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>This is a great and valuable quality which the practice of true liberty engenders by protecting the individual against excesses in the pursuit of specialties which confine the faculties of man within a narrow prison.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>The part of <orgName n="Siege Artillery" type="artillery">siege artillery</orgName> in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> was entrusted to a Connecticut regiment not a soldier or officer of which, except the colonel, had ever before handled a cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>They learned their new duties, escorted that <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> throughout all the marches of the army, and served it with great ability during the most distressing retreats, while more than once, when their pieces were in safety and the din of battle was heard in the distance, they threw aside rammer and sponge to take part in the conflict with muskets as foot-soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>In order to organize the engineer service it was also found necessary to appeal to the ardor of volunteers who had no military instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>The officers of that arm scattered among the various corps were not sufficiently numerous to direct in person all the works required by the military operations, nor to instruct the soldiers employed in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>But there were found, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, useful auxiliaries among civil engineers, a large and educated class, composed of practical men accustomed to struggle with the difficulties of the virgin soil of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>; while, on the other hand, a rapid course of special instruction imparted to a few regiments sufficed to qualify them for the most important works of engineering art, while the rougher work was entrusted indiscriminately to the various regiments of volunteers, among whom some skilful artisans were always sure to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>The construction of these works was never entirely new to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>Even the most populous States, which still possessed vast forests, all furnished a considerable contingent of woodmen or lumbermen and pioneers, inured from their infancy to the use of the axe, the pick, and the spade, and <num value="1">one</num> regiment a <num value="1000">thousand</num> strong might be seen felling more than <measure n="80acres" type="area">eighty acres</measure> (<hi rend="italics">quarantes hectares</hi>) of tall forests in a single day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>Sometimes an unfair advantage was taken of the aptitude of the volunteers for this kind of work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>They had scarcely been mustered <pb id="p.278" n="278"/> into service when a great portion of the time which should have been devoted to drilling was employed in the formation of artistically constructed <hi rend="italics">abattis</hi> and in making large entrenched camps in all the positions which it was suspected the enemy intended to attack in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2040656" n="1.000 206" reg="paducah, mccracken, kentucky">Paducah</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>These works, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, were only simple breastworks (<hi rend="italics">&eacute;paulements</hi>), formed of trunks of trees and earth, on the skirts of clearings which had been made for the purpose of freeing the approaches of the positions to be defended, and were protected by <hi rend="italics">abattis</hi> of from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> in thickness, where all the branches, skilfully turned outward, sharpened at the points, and hardened by fire, were inextricably intertwined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>It was soon rendered necessary to construct improved redoubts for <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> on the strongest positions along the line; the very nature of the ground rendered it necessary to multiply their number, and in the end they became veritable citadels, intended for guns of the heaviest calibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>There were thus erected at every available point on the large Western rivers, especially along the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, either level or plunging batteries, intended to intercept navigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>When these works constituted regular systems of defence, it was deemed expedient to connect them by means of causeways constructed with trunks of trees placed close to each other, such as pioneers build in marshy forests, and which, under the name of <hi rend="italics">corduroy roads</hi>, marked the passage of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies throughout the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>Logs of the same length, and placed crosswise alongside of each other over the miry soil of the forest, constituted the original corduroy, the pieces of which, having become disjointed by the passage of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> troops, fatigue the foot-soldiers, bruise the horses, and jar the wagons, but an entire army sometimes succeeded, nevertheless, in passing thus over many leagues of morass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>In roads for permanent use the improved corduroy was composed of large trunks placed lengthwise, supporting logs laid crosswise; pieces of timber of smaller diameter filled up the interstices of these cross-logs, and the whole was covered by alternate layers of earth and branches.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>The variety and simplicity which characterize the mechanic arts of the <rs>Americans</rs> were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> manifested in the construction of the bridges thrown over the innumerable ravines in the vicinity <pb id="p.279" n="279"/> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, forming a connection between all the army encampments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>The piers of these bridges were constructed of unhewn logs placed against a slope and laid upon each other horizontally in cross directions, resembling those pyramids of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> faces which may be seen in wood-yards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>They supported a platform of trestle-work composed of the same materials, and the whole presented a timber-work of the greatest solidity, notwithstanding its fragile appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>Skilful from the beginning in this kind of construction, the volunteers continued to improve during the war&mdash;so much so that in the <rs>Georgia</rs> campaign we shall see <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00279.00859" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s soldiers throw over the <rs>Chattahoochee</rs> a bridge <num value="30">thirty</num> metres high and <num value="290">two hundred and ninety</num> long in less than <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>They commenced operations in the former capacity in the beginning of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>; and in a single day they built a bridge across the <rs>Potomac</rs> at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> in spite of the obstacles presented by a rapid current, a water-depth of <num value="7">seven</num> metres, and the width of the river, which is more than <num value="300">three hundred</num> metres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>In <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure> a bridge <num value="650">six hundred and fifty</num> metres long was made fast in the river in water <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> metres deep, which sustained without accident the passage of an army of more than <num value="100000">100,000</num> men, <num value="6000">6000</num> wagons, and <num value="3000">3000</num> head of cattle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>The large number of mechanics found among the volunteers was on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion the means of repairing and running the locomotives which the enemy had left behind him after disabling them, until a special corps of engineers could be formed to put the military railways in working order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>This corps, as we shall see presently, rendered the greatest service by introducing a methodical system in the management of railways which doubled their usefulness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>Among all the applications of modern science in the interest of war, the most valuable was the military telegraph, which was opportunely introduced to supply the insufficiency of general <pb id="p.280" n="280"/> staffs, and was the most active aide-de-camp to the <rs>American</rs> generals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>As soon as a marching army had gone into bivouac the telegraphic wires established a connection between all the general headquarters; the tent where <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Morse,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00280.00860" reg="mostcommon:Morse,nomatch:0"><surname>Morse</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName> was hastily set up became the rendezvous of all who under any pretext whatever could obtain access to procure the latest news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>It is stated that some newspaper correspondents found means to possess themselves of important secrets by learning to distinguish the words through the clickings, more or less repeated, of the instrument while it was printing its lines and points upon a strip of paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>A corps of employes was organized for this service, selected with care and sworn to secrecy, for upon their discretion depended the fate of the armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>In the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> it was placed under the direction of <persName n="Eckert,Major,,,," id="n0321.0005.00280.00861" reg="mostcommon:Eckert,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Eckert</surname></persName>, who by his intelligence rendered the most important services.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>The field-telegraph was composed of a few wagons loaded with wire and insulators, which were set up during the march, sometimes upon a pole picked up on the road, sometimes on the trees themselves which bordered it; and the general's tent was hardly raised when the operator was seen to make his appearance, holding the extremity of that wire, more precious than that of <persName n="Ariadne,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00280.00862" reg="mostcommon:Ariadne,nomatch:0"><surname>Ariadne</surname></persName> in the labyrinth of American forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>An apparatus still more portable was used for following the troops on the day of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>This was a drum, carried on <num value="2">two</num> wheels, around which was wound a very slender copper wire enveloped in gutta-percha.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>A horse attached to the drum unwound the wire, which, owing to its wrapper, could be fastened to the branches of a tree, trailed on the ground, or laid at the bottom of a stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>A way-station was established wherever the drum stopped, even in the centre of the battle-field, and placed the troops engaged in the conflict in direct communication with the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>These fieldtelegraphs, established at the rate of <num value="3">three</num> kilometres per hour, generally extended to a distance of from <num value="8">eight</num> to <num value="10">ten</num>, and sometimes even to <num value="32">thirty-two</num>, kilometres.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>A single example will show the importance of the military telegraph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>Bodies of partisans would suddenly take possession of an intermediate station and throw the <rs>Federal</rs> staffs into confusion by sending false despatches destined to upset their plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/><num value="1">One</num> day the guerilla <rs>Mosby</rs>, having performed an exploit of this kind, took an impudent advantage of it to send to the <orgName>office of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs></orgName>, <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00281.00863" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, a despatch full of insults addressed to that high functionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>If this fact has not been positively proved, there is nothing improbable in it, and it shows that, with all its advantages, the use of the telegraph in war is not without its dangers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>In the <rs>American</rs> armies there was also organized an aerial telegraph by means of flags raised upon a long pole, which were waved to right and left over the stations in sight of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>Sometimes perched on the top of a tree, sometimes sitting astride over the roof of a house, the employes of the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">signal corps</orgName>, who performed this duty with untiring patience, transmitted the news to the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> and his orders to his subordinates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>The coolness and promptitude with which they performed this task was often of great service to the armies at critical moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/><pb id="p.282" n="282"/></p> 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> balloons were connected with the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>; and during the long inaction which its organization around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> caused, they only contributed to the amusement of those who were allowed the privilege of an ascension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>When the army found itself in presence of the enemy, the latter honored the balloons with numerous cannon-shots, especially during the siege of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, but they never succeeded in hitting them; and the greatest danger that ever threatened the aeronaut was that which he incurred in the beginning, when, as he made his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ascensions above the <rs>Federal</rs> camps, some stupid sentinel, ignorant whether the aerial voyager was friend or enemy, would be sure to fire at the indiscreet individual who thus hovered over their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>A gas generator, a heavy machine composed of ovens, retorts, and pipes, which it required <num value="20">twenty</num> trucks to carry, followed the army at a distance, and the already inflated balloons, which a whole company controlled by means of strong ropes and strove to direct along the winding roads of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>At the least puff of wind each of these monsters would give a sudden jerk, compelling those who held them captive to stand on tip-toe, and to perform, in spite of themselves, some of the strangest evolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>Although expensive, difficult of transportation, and of doubtful service, this instrument was not without its usefulness, especially during a siege, when, elevated at leisure, it could communicate the most valuable information concerning the enemy's works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>Thus, before <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, <persName n="Lowe,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00282.00864" reg="mostcommon:Lowe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lowe</surname></persName>, the operator, who carried an electric apparatus in the car and communicated by means of a wire with the <rs>Federal</rs> batteries, could indicate the result of their fire and enable them to correct their aim. At the same time he discerned the position of all the enemy's pieces with a precision which an inspection after the evacuation of the place fully confirmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>But it would be wrong to rely upon so capricious an auxiliary; for on the day of battle, when its assistance is needed to discover the enemy's reserves, a puff of wind will suffice to prevent its ascent, and the aide-de-camp sent in haste to make in that elevated observatory a reconnaissance, on which may depend the fate of a day's battle, is obliged to wait in vain for a favorable state of the atmosphere to render an ascension possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>The electric and aerial telegraphs, the balloons, and other engines <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> of that description should certainly not be despised; but they are fatal boons to the general whom they keep inside of his tent at a moment when nothing can replace the <hi rend="italics">coup-d'oeil</hi> of the master and the presence of the chief among his soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>In speaking of the organization of the <rs>American</rs> armies, we cannot omit to mention a few of the distinctive features of the volunteers who composed them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>These armies differed from ours in the large number of married men they contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>In <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> there are no military laws to interfere with marriage, and the <rs>American</rs>, who is but little addicted to domestic habits and is the artificer of his own fortune, does not enter into those calculations concerning family expenses which stifle the spirit of enterprise in a nation, and eventually impoverish its population both morally and numerically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>The war acted as a stimulus to marriage&mdash;among the officers, in the hope of being cared for by female hands if wounded; among the soldiers, because the <name>States</name> had assured a certain indemnity to their wives and a liberal pension to their widows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>Excellent workmen wherever there was any engineering work required, the volunteers were to show themselves industrious in mitigating the rigors of camp and bivouac, as they had learned from infancy to improvise among the forests light shelters or solid dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's halt the tents were replaced by roofs made of the boughs of trees, generally pitched on the skirts of a wood; for experience soon demonstrated how unhealthy it is to encamp under the thick foliage, which does not allow the air to circulate freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>When snow and ice came to surprise the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> encamped around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the soldiers did not wait for orders to go into winter quarters to provide against these new enemies&mdash;orders which a general never issued, except to deceive the enemy and when he has determined to break up the camp suddenly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>As soon as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cold weather made itself felt through the tents every <num value="1">one</num> set his ingenuity to work to devise means of warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>Only a few tents, conically shaped, with a hole at the top, like <name>Indian</name> huts, admitted the introduction of cast-iron stoves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>In the others they constructed a hearth of hardened clay or of wood covered with mud; barrels placed <num value="1">one</num> on the top of another served as chimneys; an excavation running the length of <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> the tent, covered over with large stones which retained the heat and communicated with a fire deeply set in the earth, warmed the whole interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>The tents, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> surrounded with boughs, were raised upon a wooden foundation, which resulted in forming real walls; the canvas which had done service for roof disappeared in turn, and the whole gave way to the classic log hut, with its walls of unhewn logs and its floor of rammed earth, that rustic edifice which designates the site of the future cities of the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> in the midst of the virgin forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>The soldiers of the <num value="2">two</num> armies left everywhere where they passed the winter entire villages of these primitive dwellings; but these villages, not the fruits of civilization, but of war, being abandoned as suddenly as they had been constructed, were destined to disappear rapidly without being replaced by either brick or stone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>Vigor and skill among the volunteers did not exclude instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>Active citizens in their respective counties and States, and identified with either of the political parties, they were fully acquainted with public affairs and could not dispense with newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>With scarcely any exception, they had all received that primary education which, without initiating the man into all the discoveries of science, teaches him to make use of his intelligence, which awakens a desire for knowledge, and which, when it pervades a whole population, imparts to it as much power as a simple unit placed before any number of zeros.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>It is owing to this general system of education that the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> may be called the country of progress, and that its institutions are founded upon the regular and conscientious practice of universal suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States are entirely exempt from those twin scourges inseparable from our old social systems, ignorance and pauperism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>The illiterate minority of the army was almost exclusively composed of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> emigrants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>On opening the knapsack of the <rs>American</rs> soldier <num value="1">one</num> was almost sure to find in it a few books, and generally a Bible, which he read in the evening without hiding from his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>An inkstand, a piece of blotting-paper, some envelopes ornamented with monograms, badges, and portraits completed the assortment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>He made, in fact, abundant use of the liberality of the government, which transported all his letters postage-free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/><pb id="p.285" n="285"/> A large <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs>, hung up against the tent of the adjutant of each regiment, served as a letter-box; and a few hours of rest sufficing to fill it, it was often necessary to empty it twice a day. The <orgName type="regiment" key="MA11">11th Massachusetts</orgName>, numbering only <num value="863">eight hundred and sixty-three</num> officers and men, has been cited as having sent off from its camp near <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> an average of <num value="4500">four thousand five hundred</num> letters weekly&mdash;that is to say, each soldier wrote from <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="6">six</num> letters in <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure>. Consequently, the arrival and departure of the mail played a great part in camp-life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>Together with the correspondence, the mail brought enormous packages of newspapers, which ragged boys, both on foot and on horseback, distributed in great haste, even to the remotest corners of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>They were frequently seen crying their papers on the very field of battle, and selling them to the wounded scarcely able to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>In every tent the latest news brought by the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> or the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> was read in the evening and eagerly discussed, while the soldier on duty, if he thought himself unobserved, walked up and down with his musket in <num value="1">one</num> hand and his newspaper in the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>It may not be irrelevant in this place to say a few words as to the means employed by journals to render them interesting to their numerous readers in the towns and in the camps, and to maintain constant communication between the people of the <rs>Northern States</rs> and the armies in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>Greatly in demand, less on account of their abstract opinions than for the news they promulgated, and aiming at no political propagandism except through the manner they represented facts, the principal object of each was to gather as much information as possible and to be the first to place it before the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>No efforts were spared to attain this object; and their correspondents, who were to be found in all the armies, formed a <hi rend="italics">staff</hi> (this was the acknowledged name), entitled to a place alongside of the regularly organized corps of which we have spoken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>The great journals were represented in each <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> by an accredited correspondent, whose duty it was to see everything, to take part in every expedition, and to allow no incident of the war to pass without reporting it. This staff comprised the greatest variety of characters and peculiarities of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>In its ranks were <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> writers of positive merit and men who, animated by , real passion for war, ended by exchanging the pen for the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>The life which circumstances compelled these correspondents to lead exacted special qualities&mdash;tact, daring, and a great deal of assurance, a still greater amount of patience and robust health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>When a secret was divulged, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suspicions fell upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>In consequence of a few lamentable indiscretions, the government exacted a promise from all those engaged in writing for the newspapers not to publish what it was important to conceal from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>They were therefore obliged to distinguish, among all interesting facts they were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to learn, such as could lawfully be communicated to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>More than once they had to resort to stratagem in order to evade the order of some incensed general who had forbidden their stay among his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/><num value="1">One</num> day <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00286.00865" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> drove off all the correspondents from his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>They all left, for his orders could not be defied with impunity, but at the end of <num value="1">one</num> month they were all back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>Another general, while preserving a friendly aspect toward them, found means to prevent them from seeing anything, and confined them to the simple task of reporting stenographically the prearranged statement which he gave them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>Under such circumstances, to become a close observer and an agreeable reporter, to be tolerated by the generals and welcomed by the subordinates, to know how to repay each item of information with a kind and flattering word, and in case of necessity to enforce respect through the redoubtable influence which is derived from the support of a great journal,&mdash;certainly required, to say nothing of mental qualifications, a character at once sprightly and tempered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>A private individual in the midst of a large army, having neither the shoulder-straps of the officer nor the musket of the soldier with which to influence others, or even to justify his presence there; obliged to share the dinner of <num value="1">one</num> man or to ask a ration of forage for his horse from another; always on the watch not to miss the hour of departure, which the jealous mistrust of the chief of staff carefully kept from his knowledge; always ready to throw his wallet upon his horse &mdash; a wallet oftener empty than full; sleeping wherever he could, behind a tent, in a wagon, or under a tree,&mdash;the correspondent, worn out with fatigue, was obliged every night, whilst all <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> around were reposing near the expiring camp-fires, to take out his pen and compose upon his knees, by the light of a wretched lantern, a letter capable of entertaining a public difficult to please and greedy for sensations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>Real dangers frequently caused these hardy pioneers of the press to share the glory of the soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> had in its service, with the fleets and armies, as many as <num value="63">sixty-three</num> correspondents at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/><num value="1">One</num> of them was killed on the field of battle, another was present in <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> combats and was <num value="6">six</num> times wounded, <num value="5">five</num> others were wounded, and <num value="2">two</num> died of exhaustion, while <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> fell into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>The latter were rather mildly treated in consequence of the opinion of the journal they represented, but the <rs>Confederates</rs> deemed no severity too great for those who happened to be connected with abolition papers; and the picture drawn by <persName n="Richardson,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00287.00866" reg="mostcommon:Richardson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName>, a correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>, of his sufferings in Southern prisons is <num value="1">one</num> of the most affecting narratives that <num value="1">one</num> can read.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/>Before concluding this chapter we must devote a few pages to the regular army, which was being reorganized at the same time that the volunteer regiments were forming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>This reorganization, which was rendered indispensable by the defection of a portion of the officers, by the high positions to which others had been promoted, and by the loss of soldiers who had capitulated in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, was proposed by the joint resolution of <dateStruct value="1861-05-04"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and which Congress had passed on the <dateStruct value="-07-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>To the <num value="5">five</num> regiments of cavalry which received a uniform designation a <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> was added; the number of artillery regiments was increased from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="5">five</num>, and that of the infantry regiments from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="19">nineteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>These <num value="11">eleven</num> new regiments were much stronger numerically than the old ones: the <orgName type="regiment" key="6Cav">Sixth Cavalry</orgName>, raised to <num value="12">twelve</num> squadrons, numbered <dateStruct value="1189--"><year reg="1189">1189</year></dateStruct> officers and men; the <orgName type="regiment" key="5LtArtillery">Fifth Artillery</orgName>, also divided into <num value="12">twelve</num> batteries of <num value="6">six</num> field-pieces each, commanded by <num value="12">twelve</num> captains and <num value="3">three</num> majors, comprised a total force of <dateStruct value="1919--"><year reg="1919">1919</year></dateStruct> men. Finally, instead of a single battalion of <num value="10">ten</num> companies, the new infantry regiments were composed of <num value="3">three</num> battalions of <num value="8">eight</num> companies each, and their effective force, as regulated by law, was <num value="2452">2452</num> men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>These new regiments, having once received their full complement, <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> added <num value="25000">25,000</num> men to the regular army, and thus made up the total of <num value="42000">42,000</num> men fixed by the law of <dateStruct value="-07-29"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="29">29th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>But it was so difficult to obtain recruits that in <dateStruct value="1861-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, when the enlistment of volunteers had reached the figure of <num value="640637">640,637</num> men, this army had not yet enrolled under its banners more than <num value="20334">20,334</num> men, not quite <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the number prescribed by law. The small number of enlistments in the regular army was due, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, to the fact that these enlistments were for a definite period, while the volunteers were to be discharged at the end of the war, and everybody believed that it could not last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>; then to the retention of <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> per month from the pay of the regular soldier, while the volunteer drew his compensation in full, and the <name>States</name> granted him additional bounties and secured a pension to his family; and, finally, to the spirit of comradeship which influenced the organization of volunteer companies, whilst the reputation for severe discipline which the regular army had gained kept many young men aloof from it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>This army was not only compelled to play an insignificant part in the new forces of the republic, but the elements of which it was composed were another cause of weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>Out of its <num value="20000">20,000</num> soldiers more than half, collected with so much difficulty, were entirely raw, and their instruction was the more difficult because the most intelligent, the strongest, and the most disinterested men were immediately prevented from joining their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>In consequence of the prejudices above mentioned, the proportion of new comers was even larger among the officers than among the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>The drafts which the volunteers had made upon the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the regular army had diminished their number even more than this defection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/><num value="22">Twenty-two</num> superior officers had thus left their respective commands to become generals, and officers of inferior grade had likewise been called to fill positions of trust elsewhere&mdash;so that out of the <num value="11">eleven</num> new regiments there were <num value="8">eight</num> whose nominal colonels exercised other commands as generals of volunteers, while the greatest part of their officers had received no military education whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>In fact, the vacancies had been so numerous that the <orgName n="West Point Academy" type="academy">West Point Academy</orgName>, already reduced by the withdrawal of the <rs>Southern</rs> cadets, was not able to fill them, and it was found necessary to distribute the lower <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> grades among young men fresh from civil life, who filled the subaltern positions in the new regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>Nevertheless, the <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi>, that moral influence which attaches to a word, a number, or a sign, which has the power of transforming men, soon imparted habits of steadiness and discipline to the new comers, who, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> combats, rivalled their older brethren in courage and sustained the credit of the regular troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>It was especially the regular infantry which, in consequence of its reduced strength, had to play an insignificant part among the divisions of the <orgName n="Volunteer Infantry" type="infantry">volunteer infantry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>Yet in the <orgName n="Army of Kentucky" type="army">army of Kentucky</orgName>, where it was only represented by a single battalion belonging to the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 18">Eighteenth Regiment</orgName>, that detachment distinguished itself in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle fought by that army at <placeName reg="Mill Springs, Wayne, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040311">Mill Springs</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>In the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> it was represented by <num value="8">eight</num> battalions, or a little over <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men; these were not enough for a reserve destined to strike a decisive blow, but this corps, under able command, served as a model to the others and constantly encouraged them by its example, whereas, if it had been scattered, its traditions would have been destroyed and its efficiency neutralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>Formed into a single brigade, these <num value="8">eight</num> battalions were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entrusted with the delicate duty of protecting the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; we shall find them again among the volunteers, suffering themselves to be cut to pieces rather than fall back on the battle-fields of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>The regular cavalry had a more important part to play at the beginning than the infantry, for it was proportionally more numerous, and the inexperience of the mounted volunteers compelled it to perform during a certain period of time all the duties pertaining to that arm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>From that time they found themselves sufficiently strong to teach the volunteers their business by fighting in front of them and making them gradually participate in the work, the burden of which they had hitherto borne alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>We shall frequently meet them in the course of our narrative; but in <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> proportion as the volunteers who fought by their side acquired experience, the particular importance of the regulars will diminish, and will disappear altogether when, after the reorganization of the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry, the regulars will be distributed among the various corps whose long expeditions we shall have occasion to relate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>The artillery force was increased by the creation of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 5">fifth regiment</orgName>, and the garrisons required by the armament of fortification, to a total of <num value="52">fifty-two</num> batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>Although the effective force of these batteries was far from being complete, their number gave them a preponderance in the new armies, because either the <orgName n="Regular Artillery" type="artillery">regular artillery</orgName> was kept united for the purpose of forming powerful reserves, or it was divided among the various corps to instruct the volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>This twofold duty was assigned to them in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>The formation of a strong reserve of artillery was a wise precaution in an army composed entirely of young soldiers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>These are the last lines we shall devote, by way of special mention, to the little regular army which we have followed since its formation; for after having preserved its military traditions and supported, in the hour of danger, the tottering edifice of the <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> Federal Constitution, it was absorbed into the improvised armies to the creation of which we have just referred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>But if it ceased to have a separate existence, its spirit still survived and continued to control the action of the new comers; the influence and the importance of the regular officers will increase in proportion as the volunteers acquire more military experience; and when at the end of the struggle the regular army shall once emerge to view, we shall find <num value="550">five hundred and fifty</num> of its officers detached among the volunteers, <num value="115">one hundred and fifteen</num> of whom were generals and <num value="60">sixty</num> commanders of regiments.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/><emph>B</emph>EFORE we resume the narrative of military operations we must close our inquiry into the organization of the <num value="2">two</num> contending armies with a few words regarding the manner in which they were equipped; the creation of the <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi>, so varied, so extensive, and so indispensable to both parties, was as difficult a problem for their chiefs as the reunion of the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of which they were composed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>The almost inexhaustible industrial resources of the <rs>North</rs> gave her a great advantage in this respect, but it required time to bring this <hi rend="italics">Materiel</hi> together, to transport and distribute it. It required time, above all, to introduce order and method into those operations, and to teach the armies the practical value of the instruments placed in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>In the <rs>Federal</rs> army the duty of organizing this <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi>, as we have said before, was divided among <num value="3">three</num> branches of the administration&mdash;the departments of the quartermaster, the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary of Subsistence">commissary of subsistence</rs>, and the ordnance; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> charged with equipment and transportation, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> with the provision of food, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> with arming troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>As soon as the volunteers were called out the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName> entered into contracts with home manufacturers and a few foreign merchants, which enabled it to clothe the soldiers as fast as they presented themselves, and to supply them with all the necessaries of personal outfit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>Notwithstanding some defective lots and a few very exorbitant bargains, this mercantile operation was successfully carried out. No <num value="1">one</num> was troubled at the thought of spending a few <num value="1000000">millions</num> more than was strictly necessary in order to induce persons engaged in private business to change their operations at once, so as to meet the new demands made upon the industry of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>This transformation was effected in a remarkable manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>Thus nearly all the accoutrements for the cavalry of <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> were supplied by a firm largely engaged in the manufacture of trimming-laces (<hi rend="italics">passementerie</hi>) in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, which in a few days threw aside their bobbins to engage in the manufacture of leather belts and sabres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="14months" type="date">fourteen months</measure> of the war the administrative department furnished the army with <num value="3000000">three million</num> coats and nearly <num value="2000000">two million</num> <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>It supplied <num value="240000">two hundred and forty thousand</num> tents for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> winter's encampments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>When the armies took the field, they were naturally obliged to leave all these tents behind them, with the exception of a certain number for the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>The <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName> then substituted shelter-tents, of which they distributed more than <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> in <num value="1">one</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/>These were soon improved by the use of india-rubber cloth; and the advantages of this system to the health of the soldiers in the marshy forests of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> were so great that by degrees all the coverlets of the army were replaced by the waterproof <hi rend="italics">poncho</hi>, a square piece of cloth with a hole in the centre for the head, worn over the shoulders when it rained, and in the evening spread out upon the damp ground, over which the shelter-tent was pitched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>Consequently, the number of these Indiarubber garments, which in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was <num value="40000">forty thousand</num>, rose to <num value="1000000">one million</num> <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>; and it has been estimated that, placed alongside of each other, they would have presented a surface of <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> square&mdash;that is to say, <num value="4">four</num> times as large as the gardens of the <name>Tuileries</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>The uniforms furnished to the volunteers of various arms were nearly all alike, and this similarity increased in proportion as the outfits which the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">first regiments</orgName> had brought from their respective States were replaced by the issues of the government departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>Their color of deep blue distinguished them from the gray coats of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>The felt hats and the regulation coat of the regular army, which the generals and their staffs adopted almost everywhere, were replaced by the <hi rend="italics">kepi</hi> and the blouse, a sack which had the inconvenience of being too loose to fit well about the shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>A canvas haversack, a belt to which was fastened the cartridge-box and the bayonet, completed the accoutrement of the foot-soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>The equipment of the mounted men was also copied from that <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> of the regular cavalry, although they had to wage war in a country very different from the <rs>Western</rs> plains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>The regulation saddle, called the <rs>McClellan</rs> saddle, was light and comfortable, and did not hurt the withers of the animal, but the wooden stirrups with leather coverings to protect the feet against the tall grass of the prairie were heavy and inconvenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>The cavalry soldier carried a revolver at his belt; the regulations required that he should also attach his sabre to it, but by degrees he acquired the habit of suspending it to the pommel&mdash;an excellent idea; for if the soldier, when dismounted, should never be separated from his pistol, the side-arm, on the contrary, only embarrasses his movements the moment he quits the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>The mounted men were moreover provided with a short musket, or even an infantry carbine, which greatly increased the weight of the burden of their horses, but of which they made frequent use in those engagements where they were obliged to fight on foot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>All the personal effects of the soldiers, coats, linen, shoes, and boots, were furnished directly by the administrative departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>No reduction was made from their pay to constitute a regimental fund.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>The system of making clothing in the regiments, which has enabled certain armies to practice economy, has never existed in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>It was looked upon as calculated to greatly increase the number of non-combatants in the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of a regiment, and it was deemed best to adopt the system of general contracts, more in harmony with the process of modern industry, even at the risk of furnishing the soldiers with uniforms not as well fitting as might be desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>By this means the functions of the administrative departments and the system of regimental accounts were simplified, whereas it would have been often difficult to discriminate between proper economy and illegal profits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>It was the enterprise of private individuals, under the supervision of special officers of the administrative departments, which furnished the soldiers with everything.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>Of all the operations entrusted to the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName> the most important, as well as the most difficult, was that of supplying fresh horses for the cavalry, the artillery, and the transportation departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>The consumption of draught animals by the armies was to affect seriously the agricultural <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> interests of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>The breeds of American horses are generally small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>The fatal habit of putting them too soon under the saddle interferes with their growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>The regulations which forbade their being accepted into the service under <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> of age and less than <num value="15">fifteen</num> hands high (<measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> at the withers) could not be complied with, for it was necessary to take all that could be found; and the sorrier the horses the greater the consumption, and consequently the larger the amount of fresh horses required to replace them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war the number of horses procured for the cavalry and the artillery alone was <num value="110000">one hundred and ten thousand</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>Immense <hi rend="italics">corrals</hi> were established among the vacant lots in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and of the <rs>Western</rs> cities to receive droves of animals emaciated by long journeys which the horse-contractors brought from <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>Taken a few days previously from the farm upon which they were grazing at liberty, never having been broken, these horses were crowded in a too narrow space, carelessly picketed, badly fed, seldom groomed, and without any shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>Their power of endurance under so many trials showed what robust constitutions they possessed in spite of their appearance, and the impunity with which the contractors, horse-dealers, inspectors, and the officers authorized to make their own selections moved about among them was the best proof of their docility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>Occasionally, however, some unforeseen accident would create disorder at the depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>Thus, for instance, <num value="1">one</num> evening the principal stable in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> caught fire, and <num value="600">six hundred</num> horses maddened with terror rushed through the badly-lighted streets of the capital, upsetting pedestrians and carriages on their way and spreading trouble and confusion everywhere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>Notwithstanding the enormous supply of fresh horses, the government could hardly replace the lame and foundered animals which filled the large infirmaries established specially for their reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war there were no less than <num value="57000">fifty-seven thousand</num> cured; in the course of those <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> more than <num value="1">one</num> regiment used up <num value="3">three</num> horses to every man; and it was only through the severest discipline that the mounted men were taught at last to take care of their horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/><pb id="p.296" n="296"/> Thus it happened that <num value="1">one</num> of them was killed in the streets of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> by a sentinel who had in vain ordered him to slacken his pace, in order to prevent them from madly galloping about the capital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>We have already shown by a few figures the importance of the transportation service; this importance will become more and more appparent as we proceed With the narrative of the campaigns in which this branch of the service exercised a decided influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>It will suffice to say in this place that during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year, which alone occupies our present attention, the government was obliged to furnish more than <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> wagons and <num value="84000">eighty-four thousand</num> mules, without counting the wagons brought by the soldiers themselves from their respective States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>The military transportation was effected exclusively by means of wagons, pack-horses being seldom employed in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>The officers who had made use of them in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>, while recognizing the advantages of their employment in certain cases, did not deem it expedient to recommend their adoption in a country where wagon-roads are so easily constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>This system would be attended by the very great inconvenience of making each animal carry a lighter load than if in harness; moreover, it would have been impossible to find experienced drivers to manage these pack-animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>A large establishment was established at <placeName reg="Perryville, Boyle, Kentucky" key="tgn,7017532">Perryville</placeName>, on the <rs>Susquehanna</rs>, where mules were trained to work in teams of <num value="6">six</num>, driven by word of command with the aid of a single loose rein.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>The construction of bridge-equipages, which, once collected, were placed under the care of volunteer troops specially selected for that service, belonged also to the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>The <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> of these equipages varied frequently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/><num value="1">One</num> experiment was made, and then abandoned as too complicated, with iron pontons, which in the water served as boats, and on land were placed on wheels to form trucks to bear the roadway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>In the armies of the <rs>West</rs> large bags of gutta-percha or india-rubber were substituted for boats, but were rejected by the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, as they were too easily torn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>The materials most generally in use were either simple wooden barges that could easily be <pb id="p.297" n="297"/> repaired or tubular pontons of <rs n="sheet iron" type="product">sheet iron</rs>, which had the advantage of being much lighter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>It will be enough to mention the regulation ration of the <rs>American</rs> soldier to convey an idea of the importance of the <orgName n="Subsistence department" type="department">subsistence department</orgName>, whose duty it was to provide food for the armies, which on the <dateStruct value="1861-12-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> numbered <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Consequently, notwithstanding the appetite of the <rs>American</rs> soldier and his want of economy in cooking, it would have been no easy matter for him to consume such a ration; and the <num value="47">forty-seven</num> or <num value="48">forty-eight</num> men composing a company would form a mess which enabled them to get along without drawing their full quantity of rations from the commissary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>The difference was paid to them in money, and generally formed a common fund for the company, controlled by it without the interposition of their superior officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>Occasionally a regiment would undertake a similar economy in regard to the supply of flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>A considerable number of those encamped around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> constructed earthen ovens similar to those in use among Western settlers and made their own bread, thereby realizing the double advantage of substituting fresh bread for biscuit and realizing the profits accruing from the economy of their flour rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>The task of supplying the <rs>Federal</rs> troops with arms and ammunition, which devolved upon the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">ordnance department</orgName>, was the most difficult of all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>The wonderful machines by which the most complicated rifles now in use throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> are constructed almost without the aid of man are of American invention, and have given a well-deserved reputation to the expansion rifles manufactured at the government armory in <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>But this establishment had only capacity for producing from <num value="10000">ten</num> to <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> yearly, and the supply could not be increased except by constructing new machines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>The private workshops were equally insufficient; the <rs>Federal</rs> factory at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> had been destroyed by fire, and the depots were empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>It was important, however, to supply the most pressing of all the wants of the soldier, that of having a weapon in his hands.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">ordnance department</orgName> succeeded in furnishing the various armies in the field, not counting what was left at the depots, <num value="1000000">one million</num> <num value="276686">two hundred and seventy-six thousand six hundred and eighty-six</num> portable firearms (muskets, carbines, and pistols), <num value="1926">one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six</num> field&mdash;or siege-guns, <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> pieces for batteries in position, and <num value="214000000">two hundred and fourteen million</num> cartridges for small-arms and for cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>But it was obliged to apply to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> for muskets and ammunition; this was the only war commodity that <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> procured in considerable quantities from the Old World, and it was this supply which proved to be the most defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>Agents without either experience or credit, and sometimes unscrupulous, bought in every part of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, on account of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, all the muskets they could pick up, without any regard to their quality or price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>The <rs>English</rs> and <rs>Belgian</rs> manufactories not being able to satisfy their demands fast enough, they procured from the little <name>German</name> states all their old-fashioned arms, which those states hastened to get rid of at a price which enabled them to replace them with needleguns.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>A portion of the muskets being unfit for use, the few that were serviceable had to be kept for the soldiers doing guard duty in each company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>The calibres were all mixed up; conical balls were issued for the large <name>German</name> smooth-bore muskets, while the old American cartridge, containing <num value="1">one</num> ball and <num value="4">four</num> buckshot, was given to those who had the good fortune to possess a minie rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>The defective armament of the infantry would have been sufficient to delay the opening of the campaign for several months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>In order to remedy this it was found necessary, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, to classify the calibres of the muskets by regiments, then gradually to throw aside the most worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>After a while the <rs>American</rs> factories, both national and private, were able to furnish a sufficient quantity of new arms to justify this process.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>While willing to encourage private enterprise to a great extent, the <rs>Federal</rs> government determined to control it; and in order to avoid being at its mercy, it largely extended its own establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>The rifle which bore the name of the <rs>Federal</rs> manufactory had the advantage of not requiring heavy charges, of giving a great precision of aim at a distance of from <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="700">seven hundred</num> metres, and of being easily loaded and managed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>It was therefore introduced throughout the army as fast as the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">ordnance department</orgName> was able to meet the demands that were made for that arm from every quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>But, at the same time, a great number of new inventions were tried upon a scale which enabled the authorities to test their merits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>Some were even adopted by whole regiments of cavalry; and the practice of breech-loading, which was common to all the systems, contributed greatly to their efficiency in the numerous engagements in which those regiments had to fight on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>With the exception of this mode of loading, they differed greatly in their construction; it would be impossible for us to describe all, for there were no less than <num value="11">eleven</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>We shall only mention <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.300" n="300"/> belonging to the class called repeating-rifles&mdash;that is to say, arms which fire a certain number of shots without being reloaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>This heavy weapon was formidable in practiced hands, but it required considerable time to reload it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>The butt is pierced, in the direction of the length, by a tube containing <num value="7">seven</num> cartridges, which are deposited successively, after each fire, in the chamber, replacing in turn those which, when discharged, are thrown out by a very simple mechanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>This magazine, entirely protected, is very easily recharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>Many extraordinary instances have been cited of successful personal defence due to the rapidity with which this arm can be fired, and some Federal regiments of infantry which made a trial of it were highly pleased with the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>Most of these rifles were of <num value="2">two</num> models&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> for the use of the infantry, the other, lighter and shorter, for the cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>The <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> of the artillery, which had to be created, was as extensive as the armament of the infantry, and its construction was also new to American manufactories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>Nevertheless, the great workshops for smelting iron and steel were so rapidly transformed into cannon foundries that the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">ordnance department</orgName> was not obliged to depend on <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> for a supply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>At the time when the war broke out none of the systems of rifle cannon invented a few years before had ever been adopted, or even seriously experimented upon, by the officers of the regular army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>But the latter, while adhering to the brass smooth-bore cannon, had studied these different inventions, and did not conceal their preference for the rifled system, by which the ball, like the minie bullet, inserted through the mouth of the cannon, is driven into the grooves under the pressure of the gases which propel it forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>The impression obtained from these inquiries in common was never forgotten by the officers who were placed in positions of command in the <num value="2">two</num> hostile armies; and notwithstanding the diversity of details, the guns of those <num value="2">two</num> armies always bore a strong family resemblance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>But nothing could limit the <pb id="p.301" n="301"/> fertility of inventors stimulated by the war. A few among them were men of real ability and skill, but those who indulged in chimerical speculations were more numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>Some of them were visionary and ridiculous, and there were a few to whom their inventions brought disaster, as, for example, <persName n="James,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00301.00872" reg="mostcommon:James,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>James</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hunt,Major,,,," id="n0321.0005.00301.00873" reg="nearbymention:Hunt,E.,B.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Hunt</surname></persName>, the former of whom was killed by the explosion of his gun and the latter asphyxiated by his submarine battery.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>None of these inventions were subjected to the polygon proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>There was no time for that kind of experiments which alone enabled the expert fully to ascertain the real value of an arm before it is exposed to all the vicissitudes of war. The <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> of the army was thus suddenly encumbered with a mass of different models, all equally new to those who had to handle them on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>In fact, every inventor who had any patronage could easily manage to have a few of his guns recommended to the principal of some foundry, who was generally his partner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>A few shots fired in the neighborhood of the factory were deemed sufficient to determine the strength of the guns; and if chance favored them, the piece was immediately received and added to the diversified assortment which already existed in the <orgName n="Federal Artillery" type="artillery">Federal artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>This very variety, however, was at times the means of procuring the opportunity for remarkable inventions to obtain a striking confirmation of their merits on the field of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>American genius, quick to turn everything to account, understood at once that, at a time when any delay might prove fatal, it was not expedient to look for a weapon too frail and difficult to repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>It studied, above all, simplicity in regard to the <num value="4">four</num> essential parts in the manufacture of artillery&mdash;the founding, the system of rifling, the mode of propelling balls and shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>There were wanting field-pieces that could be rapidly constructed at a moderate cost, easily loaded, so as to be handled by inexperienced hands, and projectiles that could be carried to great distances without injury to the parts intended to be forced into the grooves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/><num value="2">Two</num> guns were adopted which amply satisfied these requirements&mdash;the <name>Parrott</name> gun, made of cast iron, secured with ironplated bands at the breech, and <num value="1">one</num> gun constructed at the ironworks of <placeName key="tgn,2091914" n="1.000 8" reg="phoenixville, chester, pennsylvania">Phoenixville</placeName>, designated by its calibre, from <num value="3">three</num> to <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> <measure n="4.5inches" type="distance">four and a half inches</measure> in diameter, and made of wrought-iron bars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>The problem regarding the construction of guns of large calibre was solved by <persName n="Rodman,Captain,,,," id="n0321.0005.00302.00875" reg="mostcommon:Rodman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Rodman</surname></persName>, whose process imparted such strength to those guns, although made of cast iron, that it only required the application of the <name>Parrott</name> system of plate bands to enable them to discharge conical projectiles of the greatest weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>Up to that time the guns had been cast solid, and bored afterwards; thus the exterior of the piece, touching the sides of the mould, was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to solidify, and the interior, still half liquid, not able to contract regularly, became crystallized, leaving here and there in the mass hollows or flaws which caused the metal to lose its uniformity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/><persName n="Rodman,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00302.00876" reg="mostcommon:Rodman,nomatch:0"><surname>Rodman</surname></persName> reversed the operation, and caused the piece to cool from the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>A hollow cylinder, containing a spiral tube through which a current of cold water was kept passing, surrounded with cords and with sand to protect it from the metal in fusion, was placed in the mould to designate the bore; the gases escaped by means of longitudinal flutings in the cylinder and through the spaces left by the cords, which were constantly consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>Whilst the interior was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> portion solidified, through contact with the cylinder so constantly kept cool, the furnaces burning under the mould kept up the heat on the outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>The intensity of this heat was then gradually diminished until the entire mass had lost its redness&mdash;an operation which, for the largest guns, lasted several weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>The metal, by contracting without interference, possessed a greater density, a finer and more uniform grain; and crystallizing thus, its fibre offered the greatest possible resistance to pressure upon the bore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>A long experience has fully confirmed the principles upon which <persName n="Rodman,Captain,,,," id="n0321.0005.00302.00877" reg="mostcommon:Rodman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Rodman</surname></persName> had based his new process, which is now applied on a large scale in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>The depth and the number of the riflegrooves varied according to the calibres, but the relation between these <num value="3">three</num> elements was constant, and the same system of grooves, deep and few in number, was applied to guns of different constructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>In the <name>Parrott</name> guns the spiral of the grooves was closer near the muzzle than at the bottom of the bore; it was hoped that by this means the ball would have an increased rotary motion; but this was the cause of numerous accidents and of great <pb id="p.303" n="303"/> irregularity in the fire, as the projectile frequently refused to follow the last turn of the groove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>At the beginning of the war the precipitate haste with which it was necessary to manufacture guns was especially felt in its effects on the system of rifling, which was very defective; thus at the siege of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> a <num value="100">hundred</num>-pounder <name type="weapon">Parrott gun</name>, which had attracted attention by the irregularity of its fire, was examined after some time, when it was discovered that those in charge had forgotten to clean the riflegrooves, the roughness of which disturbed the course of the projectiles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>The form and the mode of impulsion both gave rise to a great number of different systems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/><persName n="Parrott,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00303.00878" reg="mostcommon:Parrott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Parrott</surname></persName> placed upon the base of the ball a sort of reversed cup of soft iron, in which the expansion of the gases determined the impulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>For large calibres he substituted for this cup a copper ring enveloping the base of the projectile, which under the pressure of the same gases took form as a packing (<hi rend="italics">bourrelet</hi>) in the grooves; this process being found insufficient, projections were cut on the ring to facilitate the impulsion, a sort of medium between the system of expansion and that of flanges (<hi rend="italics">ailettes</hi>).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/><persName n="Schenkl,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00303.00879" reg="mostcommon:Schenkl,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Schenkl</surname></persName> gave to the base of his projectile the form of a fluted cone and covered it with a piece of papier-mache, which stretched in slipping upon the cone, and was forced thus very exactly into the grooves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>This papier-mache, having more tenacity than lead, gave to the projectile its rotary movement, after which it might fall to the ground without danger to those near the gun, or it remained attached to the projectile without affecting its equilibrium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>Owing to the conical form of its base, the centre of gravity of the projectile was in front of the centre of the long axis, which secured the steady and exact flight of a well-feathered arrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>The only fault of the papier-mache was that it swelled with dampness, but an envelope of zinc remedied that completely; and the <name>Schenkl</name> projectile is the <num value="1">one</num> to which the experience of the war was most favorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>Many systems were tried to use lead in the form of an envelope, ring, or <hi rend="italics">ailette</hi>, but they all failed from the impossibility of making the metal adhere uniformly to the surface of the ball.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stages of the war it was difficult to distinguish <pb id="p.304" n="304"/> between the relative merits of different projectiles, the defects in the construction of most of them not allowing any satisfactory experiment to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>Thus, in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, when after several months of campaigning an inspection was made of the shells which had been furnished in enormous quantities by private establishments, it was found that the inside of a large portion of them was defective; the cavity containing the powder not being in the middle, the centre of gravity was displaced and imparted an irregularity of motion to the projectile which deprived the gun of all precision of aim.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>This carelessness, which should not be severely criticised when it is considered what efforts it required to create such vast materials within a few months, and which was moreover soon remedied, was especially felt in the construction of the fuse, the most delicate of all the engines of war. The importance of the fuse has increased with that of the shell; it imparts to this projectile all its effectiveness; if the fuse is defective, the shell becomes powerless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>The solid ball is of but little importance on a battlefield, and in our thin order of ranks makes no more victims than a simple rifle bullet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>The case is very different with hollow projectiles, especially the formidable Shrapnell shell, which was universally adopted by both Federals and Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>There is no doubt that at a short distance nothing is more effective than the grape-shot, but its field of operation is too limited to be often of decided importance in a battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>The Shrapnell shell, when it bursts at the right time, propelling all the bullets it contains in the shape of a fan before it, is the most terrible instrument of war that modern artillery possesses, and will always secure a great advantage to those who know best how to handle it; for it produces all the effects of grape-shot at the extreme range of ordinary projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>But all its effectiveness depends upon the precision with which the fuse is regulated, so as to cause it to burst in the air at the distance of a few metres in front of the line of the troops to be reached.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>In fact, the percussion fuse, which takes fire on coming in contact with a hard substance and is easily constructed, cannot be advantageously used with the <name>Shrapnell</name>; for if those projectiles <pb id="p.305" n="305"/> only burst on touching the ground, most of the shot they contain would bury itself in the earth instead of opening upon the enemy's lines like a sheaf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>The graduated fuse, the only effective <num value="1">one</num> in such a case, must be both sufficiently delicate to burn regularly during the desired number of seconds, and yet simple enough to be regulated amid the excitement of the battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>When spherical projectiles are employed, or conical shells with flanges (<hi rend="italics">ailettes</hi>), which have a certain play in the bore of the piece, the flame of the powder itself, enveloping the ball, lights the end of the fuse graduated according to the distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>But this cannot be for projectiles which exactly fill all the grooves and do not permit the flame to reach the head of the fuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>It was tried in vain to envelop them in collodion to carry the flame to that part of the shell: this preparation was stripped off before it could be set on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>Recourse was then had to the <rs>English</rs> system, called the concussion system: the shock caused by the departure of the projectile detaches a small piece of metal, which, slipping into a tube placed within the fuse, strikes and fires a fulminating primer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>The fuse is thus completely closed on the outside; but it must be seen how difficult it is to make, in improvised factories, <num value="1000000">millions</num> of such complicated instruments, and how defective, before some experience is gained in making them, they must be as to precision.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>Besides practical inventions, there were also seen some fantastical machines, such as the cannon-revolver, which will probably figure <num value="1">one</num> of these days in our own armies, but which at that time was only dangerous to those who served it. There were seen some ridiculous specimens, as, for instance, a gun lighter than its own ball, made out of an enormous ingot, whose recoil was consequently greater than the motion of the projectile itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>We will mention, finally, a new engine of destruction, which received the nickname of coffee-mill, and which may be regarded as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempt at making <hi rend="italics">mitrailleuses</hi>. This was a large rampartgun, whose open breech was surmounted by a funnel, which was filled with cartridges; these cartridges were composed of solid steel tubes containing the charge, which were successively dropped into the open space of the breech by means of a crank; a hammer, moved by this crank, struck a percussion-cap placed at the bottom <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> of the cartridge, and caused the discharge; after this discharge the tube fell into a box, from which it was taken to reload.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>This machine fired <num value="100">one hundred</num> shots per minute, and threw ounce balls, with great precision, to a distance of <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="800">eight hundred</num> metres; it was drawn with its caisson by a single horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>By means of a pivot like a pump-handle the gun was aimed without interrupting the continuous stream of balls; and this arm, handled by <num value="2">two</num> cool-headed men, might have proved very effective in defending a breach or defile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>But although <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00306.00880" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> recommended its adoption, and had even made a trial of it with his own hands, it was never used during the war; and the <hi rend="italics">coffee-mills</hi>, which, with a few alterations, might have taken the place of our <hi rend="italics">mitrailleuses</hi>, were sold after the peace as old iron, for <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">eight dollars</measure> each.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>We have only spoken of rifle cannon; they were the only guns in fashion, like the zouaves' uniforms for infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>The imagination of the volunteers exaggerated their importance, and their very novelty inspired the inexperienced soldiers of the <rs>American</rs> armies with confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>Fortunately, the artillery officers did not share this excessive infatuation, and they retained for the service of the army a certain number of brass field howitzers, smooth bore, which rendered the utmost service during the entire war. In fact, as the wooded country, where the fighting had to be done, rendered it almost impossible for the artillery to become engaged at long distances, the rifle cannon was frequently deprived of its advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>On the battle-fields of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> the gun easiest to handle, the strongest, and the most readily loaded, which, at a moment's notice, could substitute grape-shot for the shell, was also the most effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>An experience differing from that of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> wars, where armies can ordinarily fight at a distance, showed that smooth-bore guns satisfied all these conditions; a large number of them were cast, and no general ever had occasion to regret having secured them for his artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>The field <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> was thus found to be composed of smoothbore <num value="12">twelve</num>-pounders, of <measure n="3inch" type="distance">three-inch</measure> wrought-iron guns, and of bar-guns <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="4.5inches" type="distance">four and a half inches</measure> in diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/>The greatest variety was to be found in guns of heavy calibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>Besides the old mortars, <num value="48">forty-eight</num> pounders, and large cast-iron <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> howitzers, called columbiads, or <name type="weapon">Dahlgren guns</name>, there were seen rifled cannons constructed in the manner we have already stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>These were wrought-iron guns, <measure n="4.5inches" type="distance">four inches and a half</measure> in diameter of tore, much heavier than the hooped guns of the same diameter, and throwing <num value="40">forty</num>-pound balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>There were <name type="weapon">Parrott guns</name>, <num value="100">one hundred</num> and <num value="200">two hundred</num> pounders; and, finally, some enormous cast-iron guns, intended for forts and for the navy, cast on the <name>Rodman</name> plan, with a diameter of <num value="15">fifteen</num>, and even of <num value="20">twenty</num>, inches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>By means of iron carriages running over inclined planes, controlled by brakes and a strong pivot fastened to the platform, these gigantic machines could easily be managed by <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> men. We shall indicate the effect they produced in telling of the numerous sieges which characterized that war. It will be sufficient to state here that in calculating the relations existing between the calibre of their heaviest guns, the weight of the ball, and that of the charge of powder, the <rs>Americans</rs> departed from the principles adopted in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and particularly in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>Having neither the time nor the means to give their heavy rifled guns the strength of those of <persName n="Armstrong,,,,," id="n0321.0005.00307.00881" reg="mostcommon:Armstrong,nomatch:0"><surname>Armstrong</surname></persName> or of Krupp, but being able to construct them of as large a calibre as they desired, they reduced the charges of powder to an <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num>, and even a <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num>, of the weight of the ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>Owing to the large dimensions of their guns, they were able to produce results then entirely new, although they have been surpassed since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>Thus, with a gun not able to bear more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the charge of an Armstrong gun, and throwing the same ball, they obtained for this ball a velocity only <num value="0.5">one-half</num> less than that which the latter piece would have given; and to batter a wall in breach, they succeeded, by means of very large projectiles impressed with a less initial velocity, in bringing to the work of destruction a force equal to that of a ball of smaller calibre impressed with a greater velocity.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>Its principal powder-mill was at <placeName reg="Dahlonega, Lumpkin, Georgia" key="tgn,2022614">Dahlonega, in Georgia</placeName>; its manufactories of <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion-caps</rs> in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; its cartridge-factory <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and then at <placeName reg="Grenada, Grenada, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056541">Grenada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>Thanks to the activity of these establishments, the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> were never in want of ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>The government never thought of making use of the cotton which it controlled for war purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>It could not procure the different materials necessary for the manufacture of gun-cotton (<hi rend="italics">pyroxyle</hi>), and especially of nitric acid; nor had it time to make experiments upon that powerful but dangerous agent.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>Nor were the means wanting for clothing the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>This cloth, of gray verging on brown, was the color of the <rs>Confederate</rs> uniform, and was the origin of the name <hi rend="italics">gray-backs</hi>, which distinguished the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers from the <hi rend="italics">blue-bellies</hi> who followed the <rs>Federal</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>The more elegant among the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers knew how to set off the simplicity of their gray <rs n="frock coats" type="product">frock-coats</rs> by extreme neatness, but at best they could not disguise the livery of slavery which chance compelled them to wear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>May we not see in this a mockery of fate, or rather the decree of unerring justice which compelled the proud planters to wear on the field of battle and to stain with their own blood that very garment, the symbol of servitude, which had never reddened save under the lash of the overseer?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>After having assembled, organized, and equipped the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, the next thing was to feed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>Furthermore, it was important to secure the means of subsistence for the entire population of the <rs>South</rs>, which was then in the condition of a besieged city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>The feeding of the civil population became an essentially military question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>It was the more serious because until then the <rs>South</rs>, devoted to special agricultural pursuits, had drawn from the <rs>North</rs> the greatest portion of the flour and meat necessary for her consumption; but she possessed a soil adapted to every kind of agricultural produce, and in the negro race the necessary hands to continue its cultivation while the whites went to the war. The cotton-plant soon gave place to wheat and corn, more through the natural effect of the law of economy than in consequence of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0005.00315.00898" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:13"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s ordinances; for the blockade having caused a depreciation in the value of cotton, and increased the price of provisions, self-interest suggested to the planters the expediency of substituting the cultivation of cereals and the raising of cattle for their former productions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>If this interest had been different, no decree of the <rs>Richmond</rs> government could have effected such an agricultural revolution in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>This revolution soon secured, to a certain extent, the means of subsistence to the whole Southern population, and belied the predictions according to which the blockade, by starving them out, would bring them to terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>But the very abundance of these new productions of the soil, which subsisted the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> during <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, facilitated, on the other hand, the operations which were to render their adversaries victorious in the end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>A remedy, therefore, sometimes brings with it an evil greater than that which it is intended to remove; and the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, which seemed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in danger of perishing from want, found itself, on the contrary, delivered up to the invasion of its enemies by the very abundance of its resources.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3128"/>The South derived great moral and material strength from her victory; she gained <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> time to organize in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; the <hi rend="italics">prestige</hi> of success gave to her government unlimited power, and to its agents the necessary credit to borrow and to encourage the traffic in arms; her soldiers considered themselves for some time invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>But this triumph brought many illusions in its train; it was generally believed that the <rs>Yankees</rs> were unable to make another effort; the <rs>Southern</rs> people became convinced that their despised adversaries were about to give up the game, that the recognition of the new Confederacy, both by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and the <rs>Northern States</rs>, was at hand, and that it was useless, therefore, to make any further sacrifices in view of a struggle which could not be prolonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>The number of enlistments diminished at once in a striking manner at the very moment when it was most important to place the armies in a condition to assume the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3131"/>The activity of the administration was relaxed likewise, and the equipment of troops was altogether neglected.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>In this portion of the narrative, where we propose to relate the military events which occurred during the period intervening between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> defeat of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> and its new entrance in the field in the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, we shall begin by speaking of the war of which the distant plains of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> were the theatre during the latter half of the year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>The inveterate animosity of the <name>Abolitionists</name> and the pro-slavery men was to impart to that war an altogether peculiar character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>The settlers from the <rs>North</rs> and from the <rs>South</rs> were scattered over the whole surface of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>The former were in the majority in the northern part and along the borders of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, which separates <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and which the inhabitants of the latter free State cross yearly, in large numbers, on their way to the <rs>West</rs> to seek their fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>The latter predominated along the fertile borders of the <placeName reg="Missouri River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014086">Missouri River</placeName>, which flows from west to east through the country to which it gives its name; but they were so completely commingled everywhere that not a town, village, or hamlet could be found which was not divided into <num value="2">two</num> hostile camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>To the westward, along the boundary of the great desert, was the new <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">State of Kansas</placeName>, where, after many bloody strifes and cruel persecutions, the <name>Abolitionists</name> had finally come off triumphant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>To the southward extended the long frontier of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, which was exclusively occupied by pro-slavery men devotedly attached to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>The pioneers, adventurers, and outlaws who had gone to seek their fortune by means more or less legitimate in those <num value="2">two</num> States, yet scarcely under cultivation, did not fail to challenge each other, weapon in hand, in <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>; some to promulgate their political convictions, others to gratify their passions for strife or plunder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>Hostilities, therefore, broke out everywhere at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>At nearly every point of the territory isolated individuals, small groups, or numerous bands began to make war on their own account, seeking only to satisfy personal hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>There was no longer safety to be found anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/><placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, however, notwithstanding her isolation, was not neglected by the belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>They had little cause to trouble themselves about what was taking place in the western part of that State, but all that portion of it adjacent to the <rs>Mississippi</rs> was to play a great part in the military operations of which the line of that river was about to be the theatre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>The Federals could undertake no expedition, either into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, by ascending the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, or against <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and the heart of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, unless they were masters of the confluence of the <rs>Missouri</rs> and the <rs>Ohio</rs> with the <rs>Mississippi</rs>&mdash;that is to say, of <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, and of that portion of the river which separates those <num value="2">two</num> points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>The left bank was secured to them, for it belonged to <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>; to control the right bank, generally flat and marshy, it was necessary, in the first place, to occupy strongly the large city of <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, the base of operation of all water expeditions into the centre of the continent; then to prevent the enemy from taking possession of the cliffs of <placeName reg="Cape Girardeau, Cape Girardeau, Missouri" key="tgn,7013539">Cape Girardeau</placeName>, whence he could have intercepted the navigation of the river, and from occupying the positions of <placeName reg="Birds Point, Mississippi, Missouri" key="tgn,2174132">Bird's Point</placeName> which command the tongue of land upon which <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4468"/>This proclamation of the <rs>President</rs> gave rise to questions of international law of the gravest character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4469"/>In the first place, had a government the right of blockading, as a mere measure of policy, a portion of its own coasts, and of seizing all neutral vessels which should attempt to violate it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4470"/>or did not an act of so grave a character imply a formal recognition of the quality of belligerents in the insurgents, against whom the <rs>Federal</rs> government was obliged to employ such measures?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4471"/>The latter interpretation was the most rational, yet the <rs>Federal</rs> government could sustain the former by alleging that, in the <rs>President</rs>'s proclamation itself, the blockade was represented as a <pb id="p.432" n="432"/> means for collecting custom-house duties, which the insurgent States sought to get rid of. Indeed, the question was never thoroughly discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4472"/>The <name>English</name> government, with a malevolent haste which the <rs>American</rs> people regarded as a cruel wrong, took advantage of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> news of the blockade proclamation to recognize the belligerent rights of the insurgents, and to publish in its turn a declaration of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/>In performing an act of so much importance it did not even wait for the full text of the proclamation, which the despatches had abbreviated, so that the <rs>Washington</rs> government was justified in stating that the blockade was only a pretext by which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> sought to disguise a preconceived purpose, prompted by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> success of the rebellion in the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4474"/>The Federals, on their part, without ever recognizing in plain words all the belligerent rights of their opponents, had never disputed them, in fact, except in the case of the crew of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName></hi>, above mentioned.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4476"/>Paper blockades, against which neutrals so justly and so energetically protested during the wars in the beginning of the present century, are no longer countenanced by international usage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4477"/>The right in virtue of which a belligerent can confiscate all neutral vessels who shall attempt to enter a blockaded port becomes, in the hands of a great naval power, an instrument of tyranny and oppression unless it be limited by the strictest rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4478"/>This rule does not admit of fictitious blockades, and requires that the cruisers of a belligerent, to enable them to exercise the right of capture, shall be sufficiently numerous to keep a constant and effective watch over the port, or over the whole extent of the coast under blackade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4479"/>If the blockade is not maintained in conformity with these conditions&mdash;if it can be proved that it is easy to elude it&mdash;then neutrals are justified in not respecting it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4485"/>No maritime power had ever yet attempted to effectively blockade a coast of such extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4487"/>He could not justify a fictitious blockade of the <rs>Southern States</rs> by invoking the rights of the <rs>Federal</rs> sovereignty over those States; for an analogous case had occurred in <dateStruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></dateStruct>, and on that occasion the <rs>Washington</rs> government had refused to recognize the right of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> to declare a paper blockade of her own American colonies, then engaged in the war of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4488"/>But these theoretical difficulties were avoided in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4489"/>The American government, which contented itself at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> with the effective blockade of a few ports, prevented any misunderstanding, by only making prizes off those ports, and every time that its action was extended to some new point, it granted the same delays to neutrals, in regard to such point, as it had accorded at the time of the proclamation of the blockade.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4499"/>Numerous prizes soon taught the commerce of neutrals that the blockade, thenceforth effective, must be respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4500"/>The rapid rise in the prices of all imported commodities in the insurgent States presented the exact measure of the efficiency of that blockade, and furnished an irrefutable proof against those who disputed its legality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4593"/>On <num value="1">one</num> hand, it greatly facilitated the revictualling of the blockading squadrons; it diminished the number of hostile ports to be watched; it substituted a land siege for the maritime blockade; and it secured a base of operations for the army on the day when it should attempt to penetrate into the interior of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by this method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4594"/>On the other hand, the <rs>Washington</rs> government, in gaining a foothold by this means upon the soil of those States which it could not reach by land, was in hopes of reawakening some sympathy for the national flag, and desirous to establish a rallying-point for the <name>Unionists</name> of the <rs>South</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>His excuse for not having done <pb id="p.470" n="470"/> so was that he had acted out of consideration for the passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>But, in any case, his theory does not seem tenable; the assimilation of the commissioners to contraband of war was false, and the circumstances under which the seizure was made rendered it illegal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>In fact, no merchandise whatever becomes contraband of war except by virtue of its destination; thus it is that, since the invention of steam, coal has been classified in that category; guns, ammunition, articles of equipment, coke, are not liable to seizure unless the captor can prove that they were intended for a hostile port or fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>The destination of the vessel which carries such goods can alone give them that character; and if they are transported in good faith from <num value="1">one</num> neutral port to another neutral port, they are covered by the flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>Without this restriction, every belligerent could intercept the commerce of the whole world; as, for instance, it would suffice for <placeName reg="Zhonghua" key="tgn,1000111">China</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName> to be at war, to justify the latter in searching and seizing every ship engaged in carrying arms, and even coal, between <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>The Confederate commissioners, therefore, could not be assimilated to contraband of war, because, their hostile character being inherent in them, there was no occasion for making the essential distinction in regard to destination, as in the case of merchandise; and on the other hand, the seizure of all the contraband of war on board the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Trent,,,,," id="n0321.0006.00470.01829" reg="mostcommon:Trent,nomatch:0"><surname>Trent</surname></persName></hi>, and the arraignment of that vessel before a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize-court</orgName>, would have been illegal, because her destination was in reality from <num value="1">one</num> neutral port to another neutral port.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6084"/>We have shown how, after the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs>, the <rs>Federals</rs>, who were faintly prosecuting a campaign which they had not the means of rendering decisive, employed the autumn in organizing numerous armies which were subsequently to form into line under <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0321.0007.00565.02576" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n0321.0007.00565.02577" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0321.0007.00565.02578" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6087"/>During the great operations of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> the <rs>Federal</rs> armies continued to be recruited in the same manner as before; it was far otherwise with the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6088"/>The former were constantly supplied with volunteers whom the bounties, high pay, and other nobler motives induced to rally around the flag, while the draft which was resorted to at a somewhat later period was productive of utterly insignificant results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6089"/>This mode of recruiting was, on the contrary, since <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> the principal resource of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, which before long were entirely composed of conscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6090"/>The <num value="350000">three hundred and fifty thousand</num> men who had gradually filled their ranks within the space of <num value="1">one</num> year, and had arrived in time to keep the constantly increasing forces of the <rs>Federals</rs> in check along an extensive frontier, had suffered greatly for the important service rendered to their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6091"/>In the absence of bloody battles, sickness had already cruelly tried these improvised armies; then they were discouraged by the disasters they had sustained in the <rs>West</rs> at the outset of the campaign of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6092"/>Desertion, under the influence of physical and moral prostration, assumed frightful proportions&mdash;so much so, indeed, that in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> they were already materially reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6093"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moments of enthusiasm had passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6094"/>On <num value="1">one</num> hand, the volunteers whom that enthusiasm had prompted to join the ranks were impatiently waiting for the day when the expiration of their year's term of service should restore them their freedom; on the other hand, those who the preceding year had resisted the pressure of public opinion cared still less to put on the uniform now, when they had a better understanding of the privations and dangers of a soldier's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6095"/>Consequently, at the time when every preparation was being made in the <rs>North</rs> for striking a truly effective blow, the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> were on the eve of dissolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6096"/>It was a trying hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6097"/>It would probably have marked the downfall of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> if the central government had not boldly thrown aside the mask of pretended respect for the autonomy of the <name>States</name>, which it had worn until then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6098"/>It turned a deaf ear to the tardy remonstrances of those who, having essayed <pb id="p.567" n="567"/> the dangerous game of revolution against a national and popular government, were now complaining of the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6099"/>The danger was imminent, and the government met it by resorting to extreme measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6100"/>The strong hand of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0321.0007.00567.02579" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:13"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> set all the engines in motion which had been prepared in anticipation of this crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6101"/>The enlistments were suspended, and the country was beginning to feel exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6102"/>It was important to find some means to retain, at any expense, the soldiers who were in the service, and to fill the gaps which the enemy and disease made daily in their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6103"/>Such was the double purpose the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> had in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6104"/>In order to comprise all the laws concerning enlistments into the same chapter, we propose to speak of them in detail after having disposed of the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and shall confine ourselves at present to a summary view.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6105"/>The government began by addressing the volunteers whose term of service was about to expire, and in order to induce them to re-enlist for another year offered them <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> leave of absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6106"/>Some time after, when its authority was felt to rest on a firmer foundation, it did not keep its mild promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6107"/>The leave of absence which had been proffered threatened to bring about a desertion <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> at a singularly critical moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6108"/>The volunteers were allowed to re-enlist for the duration of the war, or for not less than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, on condition that they should not leave their ranks; and as a kind of compensation, they were allowed the privilege of changing their officers and of electing new ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6109"/>This permission was, in fact, an order, for the rule of political euphemisms was now established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6110"/>So, when some regiments hesitated to avail themselves of this permission, they were treated as seditious, and the most refractory soldiers, on the point of being shot, only saved their lives by the prompt signature of their comrades to the compact of a new enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6111"/>Finally, in order not to lose the services of any <num value="1">one</num> of those volunteers who were beginning to regret their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enthusiasm, the term of service of those who, when once set legally free, would be placed by their age beyond the reach of conscription, was lengthened for periods of <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6112"/>It was ordered that they should not, under any circumstances, leave the service until the effective force of the regiment to which they belonged was complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6113"/>All these violent measures, however, <pb id="p.568" n="568"/> were insufficient; they prevented the immediate dissolution of the armies, but they could not repair the losses to any great extent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6114"/>It was necessary to reach all that able-bodied portion of the population that had remained at home when the organization of volunteers took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6115"/>Consequently, from the <dateStruct value="1862-04-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> the conscription was established in all its rigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6116"/>The law regulating its operations, which we propose to analyze hereafter, continued in force until the last days of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and soon entirely replaced voluntary enlistments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6117"/>Able-bodied men over <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age and under <num value="35">thirty-five</num> were placed as a class at the disposal of the executive power, which was finally able to dispense with all formalities, such as drawing lots or dividing into classes, which in other countries tend to lighten the burden of this blood-tax.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6118"/>It applied the simple processes and expedients practiced in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6119"/>All who desired to avoid the conscription were allowed <num value="1">one</num> month's time to enlist voluntarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6120"/>Men over <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> of age, who were thereby exempted from serving in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, were enrolled into the militia up to the age of <num value="55">fifty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6121"/>It is true that such troops were not obliged to fight except upon the soil of the <rs>State</rs> to which they belonged; but as the war had been carried more or less into the territory of all the rebel States, the militia had no more chance of escaping the hardships of active service than the conscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6122"/>Indeed, their duties were the same as those performed by the other contingents.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6123"/>After having once determined upon such a measure, it was important to carry it out as thoroughly as possible, in order to turn all the resources of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6124"/>The more those resources became exhausted, the greater the necessity for a rigorous application of the conscription law. All able-bodied men who, without special exemption, remained away from the army were evidently deserters or recusants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6125"/>In seizing them, therefore, wherever found, and sending them to join the army without any other formality, there could be no trespassing the limits of the law. A fanatical portion of the population, eagerly adopting the calling of informers, assisted the agents of the central power in hunting conscripts; and these agents carried their despotism to <pb id="p.569" n="569"/> the remotest corners of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6126"/>Everything conspired, moreover, to strengthen and confirm this despotism; the very forms of liberty were rejected, and Congress, holding only secret sessions, became the blind instrument of the executive power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6127"/>After this rapid glance at the mode by which the secession leaders had raised their army, no <num value="1">one</num> need be astonished at the severe discipline introduced into their ranks from the outset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6128"/>They had been accustomed to enforce it upon their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/>It would be more correct to say, however, that the soldiers were at times turbulent, but that the want of discipline was corrected by means almost always violent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6130"/>Most of their officers had been taught to entertain but little regard for the lives of others; and from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gathering of volunteers, bloody punishments, summary or judicial, were inflicted, without exciting any of that opposition which would have been encountered in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6131"/>Numerous executions were the means of quelling the attempts at revolt which the conflicts between the <rs>State</rs> authorities and the central power, or the irregularity of pay, frequently gave rise to at the commencement; and the least suspicion of desertion, even to the interior, was mercilessly punished with death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6132"/>We have stated that the want of depots had been a constant source of weakness to the <rs>Federal</rs> army, that regiments had been reduced to skeletons for want of recruits, and that the bounties had failed to keep up their effective force; the consolidation, which was only introduced at the close of the war, had no other effect than to unite the old regiments, whereas it should have merged the new regiments into the old ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6133"/>When conscription was resorted to, the number of men furnished by that process was so insignificant that it would not have sufficed to form depots capable of supplying the regiments in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6134"/>In fact, this local conscription, which was only brought into operation for the purpose of completing the figure required for those contingents which had not been filled up by voluntary enlistments, differed entirely from that which prevailed in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6135"/>In the <rs>South</rs>, all able-bodied men being enlisted, there was no longer any fixed limit for the contingent due from each State; consequently, the <name>States</name> had no longer any interest to encourage voluntary enlistments as in the <rs>North</rs>, where, the quota <pb id="p.570" n="570"/> of each State having once been furnished, no further demands could be made upon it. The result, as we have said, was that the recruiting of the army was soon exclusively carried on by conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6136"/>The central government was constantly obliged to intervene in order to enforce its application; and leaving the control of the militia to the special authorities of the <name>States</name>, it finally substituted its own action for theirs in the organization of other troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6137"/>It thus found itself freed from all the embarrassments which the rights of the <name>States</name> and the enlistment contract entered into with the volunteer imposed upon the authorities of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6138"/>It could dispose, as freely as any <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> government, of the soldiers whom the law had authorized it to raise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6139"/>It made use of this power without any reservation whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6140"/>Camps of instruction were formed during the early part of the war for the purpose of assembling and organizing the volunteers; these camps were further extended, and became permanent depots for drilling recruits and for maintaining the effective strength of the regiments in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6141"/>As the conscripts of the <rs>South</rs> had no choice of regiment when once taken by the recruiting officers, they were promiscuously forwarded to <num value="1">one</num> of these depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6142"/>There they remained, simply divided by States, until the day when they were put on the march to join <num value="1">one</num> of the armies in the field, and to be incorporated into those regiments of their own State which most needed reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6143"/>This proceeding was certainly much at variance with Southern theories regarding the sovereignty of States, but it rendered the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> more homogeneous, and thus assured them, for a time, a decided superiority over their adversaries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6144"/>Both parties, it is seen, were eagerly preparing for the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6145"/>If the conflict did not commence as soon in the <rs>East</rs> as on the great rivers of the <rs>West</rs>, it was the absence of those ever-open highways, together with the importance of the game about to be played, and not the want of military resources, which kept the combatants apart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6146"/>We left the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> in its quarters around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> at the close of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, organizing for the great campaign which was to open-at least it was so hoped &mdash; the gates of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to the <rs>Federal</rs> troops in the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6147"/>Nothing had been <pb id="p.571" n="571"/> spared in the preparation of this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6148"/>The nation had been prodigal of men and money; the government had placed all its resources at the disposal of the new <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>, and he was applying himself with indefatigable zeal to turn them to account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6149"/>A few mistakes, some trivial errors and imprudences committed by the civil and military authorities, were unfortunately destined to compromise the results of so many efforts, even before the season permitted the army to take the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6150"/>We have seen what a fatal influence political considerations had exercised over military operations in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> since the beginning of the war, owing to the situation of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6151"/>The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, having its headquarters in the <rs>Federal</rs> capital, was therefore in the <rs>President</rs>'s hands and under the eyes of Congress, and was doomed to see the civil authority, controlled by a wild ardor or miserable intrigues, constantly interfering with its management.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6152"/>Moreover, being entrusted with the defence of this capital, it could not move <num value="1">one</num> step away from it without causing inquietude to those even who were loudest in denouncing its inaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6153"/>Consequently, during the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of its collective existence, it had to struggle against unjust impatience and puerile alarms, which frequently lost it the fruits of long labors and painful sacrifices.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6154"/>After the severe lesson of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, however, the good sense of the public silenced the clamors of criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6156"/>Shortly after the disaster of <placeName reg="Ball's Bluff">Ball's Bluff</placeName>, his elevation to the supreme command of the army entailed upon him the most overwhelming cares; the reorganization of all the armies of the republic, and the plans for combined action he had conceived, no longer allowed him to think of putting the troops, the command of which he had especially reserved for himself, immediately in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6157"/>The people, who placed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entire confidence in the young general, and properly mistrusted their own judgment, had easily become reconciled to a long inaction during those months when the season might yet have admitted of military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6158"/>But their patience began to give out when the opportunity had passed, just as the coming of winter doomed the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> to several months of inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6159"/><pb id="p.572" n="572"/> The soldiers, fascinated by the attractions of a life which was new to them; the lower officers, stimulated by the hope of some distinction&mdash;all were anxious to take their revenge without delay, and it required all the authority their general had established among them to make them bear this long inaction without a murmur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6160"/>The leaders, on the contrary, deeply impressed with a sense of their responsibility, with sufficient experience to see all that was wanting in their men, and forgetting at times that their adversaries were in a similar condition, were nearly all desirous of postponing the opening of the campaign until spring.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6161"/>This delay certainly involved some serious military and political disappointments; but its most fatal consequences must be attributed to the spirit of party, which sought to employ it for its own purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6163"/>But the latter belonged to the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, which had opposed the election of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6164"/>In <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>, where everybody entertains an opinion, and must adhere to it not to lose influence, the party which attains to power is very exclusive in the distribution of places and favors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6165"/>Consequently, the nomination of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0321.0007.00572.02583" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, and several other officers of the same party, to important commands, was regarded as a significant fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6166"/>It was construed as a pledge of patriotic harmony among all those who remained loyal to the national cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6167"/>But this kind of reconciliation could not extinguish party jealousies and personal animosities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6170"/>They replied to the attacks of their adversaries with threats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6171"/>Their language, always imprudent, and even reprehensible, although spoken in low tones, was at last heard by a people noted for their scrupulous observance of the formalities of law, and always mistrustful of military chieftains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6173"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, as he was paying a just tribute of respect to the qualities of his adversaries, in language full of dignity and propriety, there happened to be by his side some old political allies of the <rs>South</rs>, who ventured to express a hope that they might soon find auxiliaries in them against the <q direct="unspecified">accursed abolitionists.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6174"/>They wished to convey the impression that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victory of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> would enable its chief to play the part of a mediator, to impose a peace of their own choosing upon both the government of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and that of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, pretending that they saw a deep political combination in the inaction to which <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0321.0007.00573.02588" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was condemned by the difficulties of his task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6175"/>His loyalty, his patriotism, and the character of the <rs>American</rs> people fortunately rendered all such dreams perfectly chimerical; but they afforded a plausible pretext to his enemies, and the honest soul of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0321.0007.00573.02589" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was more than once troubled by it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6177"/>The practical good sense and innate uprightness which had won the latter the appellation of <q direct="unspecified">Honest <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName></q> failed him on this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6387"/>This invention, now familiar to everybody, is that of vessels with revolving turrets, which <persName n="Ericsson,,,,," id="n0321.0007.00592.02657" reg="mostcommon:Ericsson,nomatch:0"><surname>Ericsson</surname></persName> had submitted to the <rs>French</rs> government as early as <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, during the siege of <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,2650580">Sebastopol</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6388"/>He was aware that, in order to solve so novel a problem, it would be necessary to discard all traditions regarding naval architecture, to abandon the system of high-decked ships, as the engineers of the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> century had given up the castellated forts of the <rs>Middle Ages</rs> for the low profiles of modern fortifications; then the necessity of encasing the sides of vessels with heavy iron armor introduced a complete change in the conditions of the equilibrium which establish their water-line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6389"/>This armor, in order to afford efficient protection, had to be of such thickness that it greatly overweighted vessels of moderate size; and in order to reduce the proportional relations between the weight of the armor and that of the volume of water displaced by the hull to a figure compatible with the essential conditions of navigation, it was necessary to build vessels of enormous tonnage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6390"/>The <hi rend="italics">Warrior</hi> was then the type of such vessels, to which <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> navies have persistently adhered, notwithstanding the fact that the increasing thickness which it has been found indispensable to impart to their sheathing no <pb id="p.593" n="593"/> longer admits of protecting every part effectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6392"/>He discarded the system of vertical sides, concentrated the guns upon the axis of the ship, and placed them inside of <num value="1">one</num> or more turrets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6393"/>He was thus enabled to increase both the calibre of the guns and the thickness of the sheathing which sheltered them, without overloading the hull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6394"/>While the curved faces of the turrets presented but <num value="1">one</num> mathematical line where a cannon ball could strike them normal to the surface, the deck, lowered nearly to a level with the water, could not be reached by projectiles except under an extremely sharp angle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6395"/>The turret, supported at once upon rollers placed under the base and by a central axis put in motion by a cog-wheel, turned easily with the <num value="2">two</num> guns it contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6396"/>They could thus point in every direction, and a prismatic glass permitted this to be done without opening the port-holes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6397"/>Thus the ship projected by <persName n="Ericsson,,,,," id="n0321.0007.00593.02659" reg="mostcommon:Ericsson,nomatch:0"><surname>Ericsson</surname></persName> could easily be constructed, and at a moderate expense; in case of a reverse, but few lives were exposed, as it only presented a small number of surfaces to the enemy; with the whole horizon as the range of shot for each of the guns she carried; in short, this vessel combined the double advantage of being encased in a thicker armor and of carrying more powerful guns than the largest high-decked vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6398"/>It is true that her flat bottom and slight elevation would not permit her to make long voyages on the high sea; and <persName n="Coles,Captain,,,," id="n0321.0007.00593.02660" reg="nearbymention:Coles,Cowper,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Coles</surname></persName> had intended to remedy this difficulty by proposing a ship with a keel, whose inclined sides should be surmounted by the turrets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6400"/>He saw, what experience will demonstrate more and more conclusively, that a mixed vessel, built to carry an armor and at the same time to undertake long voyages, will always be less powerful in a fight than the coasting-vessels she will find at the entrance of the enemy's ports, and less buoyant on the waters than the wooden or plated vessels that will elude her to scour the seas.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6401"/>When the civil war broke out, it was as easy for both parties <pb id="p.594" n="594"/> to foresee the great part reserved for iron-clad vessels as it was difficult to make a definite choice among the opposite systems, none of which had as yet received the sanction of experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6817"/>The superintendence of these operations was entrusted to special officers, who acted, some as inspectors to verify accounts, and others in the capacity of paymasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6818"/>The latter, having to settle all the authorized expenses in the different branches of that department, had to give bonds as a guarantee for the proper disbursement of the large sums of money which they received directly from the government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6819"/>The ordnance and subsistence departments, whose functions we have already sufficiently described, were organized in the same manner as the preceding, the inspection and disbursements being made in the corps itself by officers especially detailed for that service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6827"/>We will thus be spared the necessity of recurring to these details when we shall have to speak of the volunteer armies which were formed on the same model.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6830"/>Under his immediate direction there were the personal aides to the general, who, apart from the special missions entrusted to them, had no other duties to perform than the name indicated, to accompany him, carry his orders, observe what he could not see for himself, and receive all the communications addressed directly to him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6831"/>All that depends upon the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Staff">chief of staff</rs> with us was left to the care of the <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Adjutant General">assistant adjutant-general</rs>, and, in a small portion, to the <rs type="role" reg="Inspector General">inspector-general</rs> of the army.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6833"/>These heads of the administrative branches of the service had under their respective commands sole officers (or physicians) <pb id="p.634" n="634"/> and non-commissioned officers, but no troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6834"/>The teamsters, laborers, and hospital nurses were civilians hired for that purpose, or soldiers temporarily detached from their regiments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6835"/>At headquarters the special arms of the service had each a chief surrounded by his own particular staff, such as the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">chief of artillery</rs>, the chief of engineers, and the chief of topographical engineers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6836"/>Sometimes, with armies in the field, the cavalry were also under a special commander, called the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Cavalry">chief of cavalry</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6838"/>Let us now proceed from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the last degree, from the general headquarters to the regimental, or rather the battalion staff; we shall find that their administrative functions were very limited, which increased so much the importance and the duties of the special corps of the service detailed to assist in all that concerns the interior regimen &mdash; a service from which such officers are excluded in the organization of the <rs>French</rs> regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6839"/>In the <rs>American</rs> regiment there are no regimental accounts, no fund, no <orgName n="Administration Council" type="council">council of administration</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6841"/>The other was the quartermaster of the regiment, who, acting under the immediate authority of the brigade-quartermaster, delivered to the regiment the personal effects, all made up, which he had requested and received from the central depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6842"/>The regiment, unless it formed no part of a brigade, had no commissary of subsistence, the commanders of companies keeping direct accounts with the commissary of brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6843"/>If, at any time, the opportunity presented itself for practicing certain economies in the expenses of the regiment, especially as regarded the companies' rations, the officers had absolute control of the matter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6844"/>All the records, writings, reports of condition and administrative control, were in the custody of the adjutant of the regiment, whose functions resembled those of our major; he had charge of all the regimental accounts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6845"/>On <num value="1">one</num> hand, he had to verify the reports furnished by the commanders of companies, and to examine their several books; on the other hand, he had to check and register the operations <pb id="p.635" n="635"/> of the quartermaster, the <rs type="role" reg="Ordnance-Sergeant">ordnance sergeant</rs>, and the supplies furnished by the brigade <rs type="role" reg="Commissary of Subsistence">commissary of subsistence</rs> for the mess of companies and the hospital.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6850"/>It was only by degrees, however, that she found out all the evils of which slavery was the source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6851"/>Being seized with charitable enthusiasm at each sight of the picture, she wished to apply some remedy to it, but each time she stumbled against some new obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6852"/>It appeared to her that, the power of the master being so great, he might have used it in correcting the abuses of slavery; but on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, the prejudices, the interests, the institutions, which fettered the hands of the masters, and on the other the despondency which has a prostrating effect upon the strongest minds when doomed to a hopeless life of servitude, neutralized all her best intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6853"/>She acknowledged at last that slavery is almost as wretched under a good master as under a bad <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6854"/>She became convinced, by constantly-recurring examples, of the intelligence of the negro and his aptitude for intellectual improvement, which place him on the same level with ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6855"/>The moral degradation attributed to him, which was made the miserable pretext for his servitude, was only the natural consequence, as may be seen in every page of the journal, of the condition to which he had been reduced.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6856"/>A single word placed at the beginning of the book allows us to guess what was the cause which induced the frightful denouement of the pictures, which the author brings abruptly to a close when leaving the plantation for ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6857"/>An unholy day arrived when all the slaves were <pb id="p.636" n="636"/> sold at auction.
