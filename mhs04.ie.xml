<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><emph>T</emph>HE place selected by the early travellers for crossing the river by means of a ford was the most easterly point where the river itself could be reached without crossing the marshes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Most of the travelling in those early days for any considerable distance was on horseback, and as the marshes were too soft to support the weight of a horse, it was necessary to select a fording place where a firm gravel deposit formed the banks and bed of the river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The place selected on the south side of the river was a little west of the northerly end of <address><street n="Walnut street">Walnut street</street></address>, and west of and adjoining the estate of <persName n="Chandler,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00002" reg="mostcommon:Chandler,M.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chandler</surname></persName> on South street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>It is evident that this estate encroaches somewhat upon the original landing place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>On the northerly side of the river the landing place was nearly opposite the location of the old <orgName n="High School" type="school">high school</orgName> building on <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The southerly end of <placeName reg="Pasture hill">Pasture hill</placeName> at that point formed the bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Persons travelling towards the <name>north</name> and <name>west</name> would leave the river and pass up the steep bank to the left in front of the location of the public library building, and those travelling eastward would turn to the right along the gravel beach to a point near the <name>Cradock</name> farmhouse which stood on what was then known as <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Salem Path">Salem Path</placeName> to <placeName>Mistick Ford</placeName>,</q> near the present square.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>In order to verify the correctness of some of these statements, and to form an idea of the situation then existing, let us take a position on the hill in the rear of <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> the old <orgName n="High School" type="school">high-school</orgName> building and, looking towards the river, see in imagination the retaining wall on the north side of the river, and the earth filling back of it removed; also the retaining wall supporting the southerly side of <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>, that extends from the dwelling house of <persName n="Bemis,Doctor,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00003" reg="mostcommon:Bemis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Bemis</surname></persName> to a point opposite the driveway of the public library, and the filling back of that also removed; see the new channel of the river filled up so as to turn the water into its original course, sweep away all buildings and other improvements, remembering that the tide once flowed into the square, that <persName n="Cradock,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00004" reg="mostcommon:Cradock,nomatch:0"><surname>Cradock</surname></persName> bridge was twice its present length, and that the south bank of the river was then substantially as at present; see also the narrow cart path creeping along the bank of the river, just above high-water mark, and then climbing the steep bank in front of the public library building, and we shall then understand the situation thereabouts when the ford was in use.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The general course of the river from <placeName reg="Cradock bridge">Cradock bridge</placeName> to the northerly end of the ford is nearly <name>east</name> and <name>west</name>, then it takes an abrupt turn in a southwesterly direction, bringing the landing places on the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> side of the river about opposite each other, and making the course of the fording place lengthwise of that portion of the river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The place thus designated as the site of the ancient ford at <placeName reg="Mistick">Mistick</placeName> does not agree with those selected by the historians of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>to place the minimum age at which children maybe admitted to the public schools at <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> instead of <num value="4">four</num>.&mdash;The former course would be attended with a heavy expense, which the town at present is ill-prepared to meet: besides, were the <rs type="place">Town</rs> ready to incur the expense, the school-houses could not be prepared in season to accommodate the schools the coming winter: moreover, the <rs>South</rs> school-house is so incommoded by the smoke and oil of a neighboring factory that it is doubtful in the opinion of your committee whether it ever <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to be enlarged, or even retained as a school-house unless the nuisance can be removed.&mdash;Your Corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>therefore, recommend the latter course.&mdash;It is a well-attested fact that many children are injured in body and mind by the <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> confinement of a school-room at the tender age of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>; and it is very questionable whether children admitted to the public schools at <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, will be farther advanced at <num value="8">eight</num>, than those admitted at <num value="5">five</num>.

<p>The <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">School Committee</orgName> report: That they have given earnest attention to their arduous trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The experience of every month gives them a deeper sense of the importance of frequently visiting and carefully watching over the interests of the public schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Accordingly they have not been sparing of time or labour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>They have held regular meetings monthly, and frequently met at other times, when the welfare of the schools called for special attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>In addition to the usual public examinations, some part of the <rs>Committee</rs> have visited every school at least once a month, generally much oftener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>And from all this actual observation they are fully satisfied that there has been a progressive improvement in the condition of the <rs type="place">Schools</rs> collectively through the past year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>A spirit of order &amp; decency prevails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The progress of the scholars indicates <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> great dilligence in them and in their Instructors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The discipline is excellent without severity; and the method of teaching is most thorough and accurate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>In these respects it is believed that our schools will bear a comparison with any similar institutions in the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It is a well known fact that children are apt to fall into idle habits and soon come to take little interest in Schools, which are neglected by their parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The Committee cannot too strongly urge upon their fellow citizens the importance of visiting the public schools often, that they may encourage and stimulate both Teachers and Pupils by their attention, and see for themselves in what manner &amp; with what results their money is expended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>They should remember that their outlay for the purposes of education is invested in the character and best interest of the rising generation; and, that, if well employed, it will yield a return richer than any other expenditure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>If parents would make the most of their advantages, let them cherish in their children a profound respect for the character and authority of their Instructors; and be careful that they are constant &amp; punctual in their attendance at School.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Much harm is often heedlessly done by complaining sometimes in the presence of pupils&mdash;without a sufficient knowledge of facts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The Committee are of opinion that the appropriation of the last year has been profitably expended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>They recommend the continuance of the present organization of the <rs type="place">Public Schools</rs>, the usefulness of which becomes every year more apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>They should be cherished as the pride and hope of the <rs type="place">Town</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Let every effort be made to sustain them at the highest point of excellence, that they may afford to all the means of a thorough practical education; that, in these seminaries, the children of the poor and the rich may be trained together, with feelings and principles in harmony with the genius of our institutions, which recognize no distinctions but such as arise from character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/><pb id="p.24" n="24"/></p> 
<p>In this connexion the <rs>Committee</rs> beg leave to suggest to parents, and other friends of improvment, that for a trifling expense they can have access to a well chosen library, now large and every year growing in value and importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Good books are safe companions; and a relish for them is the source at once of the highest &amp; the cheapest enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>And this is not all. It is impossible to calculate the amount of knowledge which children may derive from these works of the living and the dead, before they arrive at maturity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Nothing can do so much as a habit of reading to cherish purity of character, to promote intelligence and carry out plans of public improvement indefinitely beyond the point where it must be left by the <rs type="place">Public Schools</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The number of Scholars has increased so considerably that it has been necessary to provide additional accommodations in some of the schoolrooms; and these are still too small for convenience &amp; comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The number of pupils is at present,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>During the last year the <rs>Committee</rs> have been obliged to make several alterations in School houses in order to accommodate the constantly increasing numbers of Scholars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>And they would suggest that some of them are too small for convenience and comfort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>To meet the expenses of the <rs type="place">Schools</rs> for the present year the <rs>Committee</rs> recommend the appropriation of <measure n="3200dollars" type="currency">$3,200</measure>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/><emph>I</emph>T is with much hesitation, not to say reluctance, that I consented to appear before you to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Most of the topics of primary interest connected with the history and evolution of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> have been fully and ably treated by other members of the <name>Association</name> in the papers they have read before it, and I have been much at loss for a subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>But the chairman of your committee urged that a gap was to be filled, and has wedged me into it. To meet his wishes in a very informal manner I bring together some of my earliest recollections of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> and its people, going back to the year <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>, when my parents took up their residence in this town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Some of these reminiscences have already appeared in print, but they are essential to my purpose, and will probably be new to most of you. <pb id="p.62" n="62"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>I was about <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old when <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> became my home, and I have a very distinct recollection of the impression the town made upon me on my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduction to it. It had then a population of little more than <num value="2200">two thousand two hundred</num>, pretty widely scattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>You must remember that since then we have lost some territory, taken from us to help form the towns of <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>The older part of the town showed all the marks of its antiquity, and its general aspect was <num value="1">one</num> of old-time respectability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>I do not suppose, however, there were a dozen houses in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> at that time that cost more than <measure n="6000dollars" type="currency">six thousand dollars</measure>. They were plain but substantial structures that accorded well with the homely ways and thrifty habits of the earlier <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>There was plenty of timber in the frames of these buildings, not held together with <num value="10">ten</num>-penny nails, but well mortised and well braced, calculated to set at defiance a <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> gale or a winter blizzard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>These houses were all hand-made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The mechanics of those days could frame their own sashes and doors, and could turn out, often with self-made tools, the most elaborate mouldings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>We have <num value="1">one</num> of them in our own body in the person of our respected fellow-citizen, <persName n="Johnson,Mister,Cleophas,,," id="n0334.0014.00062.00951" reg="default:Johnson,Cleophas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Cleophas</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>&mdash; long may he live!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>but his works will live after him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>To resume my description of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>: the public square and high street as far as <placeName reg="Meeting House brook">Meeting House brook</placeName>, looked very much as they do now, making allowance for some changes in buildings&mdash;not very many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Between <placeName reg="Meeting House brook">Meeting House brook</placeName> and the <orgName n="Lowell Railroad" type="railroad">Lowell railroad</orgName> there were very few houses&mdash;not more than half a dozen, as I remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/><placeName reg="West Medford">West Medford</placeName> had then practically no existence as a settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>There was but a house or <num value="2">two</num> on <address><street n="Purchase street">Purchase street</street></address> (now <address><street n="North Winthrop street">North Winthrop street</street></address>) as far as the present <placeName reg="Winchester line">Winchester line</placeName>; and the same might be said of <address><street n="Forest street">Forest street</street></address> up to the <placeName reg="Stoneham, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050706">Stoneham</placeName> line, &mdash;as well as of <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address> below <address><street n="Fulton street">Fulton street</street></address> to the <placeName reg="Maiden, Catawba, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075583">Maiden</placeName> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>On <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, from the present <rs>Stearns</rs>' <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> avenue to the <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName> line, there were only <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> houses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>To sum the matter up, the bulk of the population of the town lived within half a mile of the square, including <address><street n="Ship street">Ship</street></address> and <address><street n="Park street">Park streets</street></address>, Union street,&mdash;then called <address><street n="Back street">Back street</street></address>,&mdash;and a portion of <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> street as far as the <placeName reg="Winthrop, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050990">Winthrop</placeName>-street bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>There were but <num value="3">three</num> houses on the <rs type="place">Medford turnpike</rs>, now called <address><street n="Mystic avenue">Mystic avenue</street></address>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>I think I have given you a pretty accurate account of the distribution of the population of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>With boyish enterprise I soon made myself acquainted with the topography of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Let me tell you of a little incident which happened to me the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I crossed over to the south side of <placeName reg="Cradock bridge">Cradock bridge</placeName>&mdash; then a wooden drawbridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>I had just got over when a great hulking boy stepped up to me, looked me in the face, lifted his fist and straightway knocked me down&mdash;all this without saying a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>He was probably influenced by the feeling illustrated in a story of <q direct="unspecified">Punch.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/><num value="2">Two</num> cads are standing on the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/><num value="1">One</num> says to the other, <q direct="unspecified">Bill, who is that fellow over there?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/><q direct="unspecified">Don't know,&mdash;a stranger, I guess.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/><q direct="unspecified">Heave half a brick at him, Bill!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/></p> 
<p>The fighting spirit was rife among <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> boys in that day&mdash;fostered, I think, by the immemorial feud which had existed between the boys of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, and which had found its field of action on the canal in skating time every winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>They fought some pretty stiff battles at those times, not without bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Our town boys used, in Homeric fashion, to taunt their opponents with this doggerel: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="pentameter"> <l><persName n="White,,,,," id="n0334.0014.00063.00952" reg="mostcommon:White,John,T.,,:2"><surname>White</surname></persName> cockade and peacock feather,</l> <l><placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> boys will fight forever;</l> <l><placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> pigs stay in their sties,</l> <l>Afraid of getting bunged &mdash; up eyes!</l></lg></quote> Just the same, the <rs>Charlestown</rs> <q direct="unspecified">pigs</q> did not acquit themselves ingloriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>It is dangerous to call your adversaries <hi rend="italics">pigs</hi>, as the <rs>Spanish</rs> have found out. <pb id="p.64" n="64"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>Before passing on, let me say that the boy who knocked me down so summarily, a few months later sat next to me in school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>We became very good friends and he used to bring me nice apples from his father's orchard&mdash;the <q direct="unspecified">high-top sweetings</q> of those days, which, like many other good things, have passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>I asked him <num value="1">one</num> day why he had struck me. <q direct="unspecified">Oh,</q> said he, reassuringly, <q direct="unspecified">only for fun.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>It was all very well, but I couldn't help thinking the <q direct="unspecified">fun</q> was very unevenly divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The poor fellow a few years later went to sea with <persName n="Redmond,Captain,,,," id="n0334.0014.00064.00953" reg="mostcommon:Redmond,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Redmond</surname></persName> of this town, and while the ship was lying at New Orleans fell from the yard-arm and was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>His life was short, and perhaps I ought not to be sorry to remember that during its brief term it fell to my lot to contribute something to his amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>But he struck very hard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Of the old inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> I might say a good deal if time permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>I have seen among them people of pre-Revolutionary birth, and of course they had the ways and manners of the olden time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Some of them were men of marked character and wide experience, and there were traits of eccentricity in others, the display of which was always interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>We boys used to like to sit in a corner of the old reading-room in the square and listen to their talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>There was old <persName n="Blanchard,Mister,Andrew,,," id="n0334.0014.00064.00954" reg="default:Blanchard,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Blanchard</surname></persName>, the most irascible of men, who could never endure any allusion to the <orgName n="New Church" type="church">new church</orgName> which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Parish had built, because he had lost his pew in the old <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>He never set his foot in the new edifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>His intimates liked to goad him by introducing the objectionable topic, for these old gentlemen were much addicted to guying each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>On such provocation <persName n="Blanchard,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0014.00064.00955" reg="nearbymention:Blanchard,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blanchard</surname></persName> would leap from his chair and emphasize words of passionate protest with thumps of his cane upon the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>Then there was old <persName n="Bradbury,,William,,," id="n0334.0014.00064.00956" reg="default:Bradbury,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Bradbury</surname></persName>, who would never stay in church after <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>. As soon as the clock sounded its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> note he jumped from his seat, seized his hat, opened the pew <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> door, slammed it, and wrathfully stumped his way out of the church.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>All this reminds me of the fact that very many of the families of the town, formerly quite prominent in its business and social life, are no longer represented here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The <rs>Blanchards</rs> in the earlier day were very numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>There were several families of them, all of them probably nearly or remotely connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>In looking over the register of baptisms kept by <persName n="Seccomb,Mister,Thomas,,," id="n0334.0014.00065.00957" reg="default:Seccomb,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Seccomb</surname></persName>, parish clerk, and covering the years from <dateStruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, I was surprised to see how many of the recipients of the sacred ordinance bore the name of <persName n="Blanchard,,,,," id="n0334.0014.00065.00958" reg="nearbymention:Blanchard,Andrew,,,"><surname>Blanchard</surname></persName>; they made up a good percentage of the whole number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>I know of but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the stock now living here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>By the by, the register I have referred to records the fact that <num value="1">one</num> infant was baptized who was born on the morning of the <name>Sunday</name> on which the rite was administered!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Thus they snatched a brand from the burning!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>The Bishops were also a prominent family in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> for more than a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/><persName n="Bishop,Mister,Nathaniel,,," id="n0334.0014.00065.00959" reg="default:Bishop,Nathaniel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Nathaniel</foreName> <surname>Bishop</surname></persName> died in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, and after his death his children took up their residence in other parts of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>I also have a kindly remembrance of the fine family of the <name>Clisbys</name>, with which I was very intimate in my boyhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>They are all dispersed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most interesting memorials of the past standing in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> was the <rs type="place">Tufts house</rs> in the public square, on the western corner of <address><street n="Forest street">Forest street</street></address>. It was torn down in <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>It was a large unpainted wooden building, <num value="3">three</num> stories high in the front, and sloping down to <num value="1">one</num> low story in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Such was the picturesque style of building our fathers affected a century and <num value="0.5">a half</num> ago. During the later years of its existence the house was in a dilapidated, not to say ruinous, condition, its bulging walls and sunken floors threatening immediate collapse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>I think it was only upheld by its immense chimney&mdash;the largest I ever saw&mdash;which stood in the centre of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>Portions of the building were utilized to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>In the front apartment, on the east side, I can remember that a small bookstore was kept by <persName n="Randall,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0014.00066.00970" reg="mostcommon:Randall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randall</surname></persName>, who had also the charge of the social library which found a place in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The front room on the western corner was for many years used for the reading-room to which I have already referred, and concerning which I shall have something more to say.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>Formerly the upper story of the rear of the building was occupied by a hall, which served as the village ball-room, and was sometimes used for concerts and for the exhibitions of professors of legerdemain and itinerant showmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>To be sure, some of the old buildings have disappeared and new ones have been put up in their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>The old Cotton bakery and the <rs type="place">Tufts house</rs>, on either corner of <address><street n="Forest street">Forest street</street></address>, have given place to new structures, and the <rs type="place">Opera house</rs> and <orgName n="Savings Bank" type="bank">Savings Bank</orgName>, in their architectural bravery, put the plainer buildings in their neighborhood somewhat out of countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>And he would miss the noble oxen, waving their heads and ruminating their liberal allowance of corn fodder which was spread before them, their warm, fragrant breath floating away on the frosty air, the scene affording a motif to inspire the best efforts of a <persName n="Potter,,Paul,,," id="n0334.0014.00071.01017" reg="default:Potter,Paul,,,"><foreName>Paul</foreName> <surname>Potter</surname></persName> or a Troyon.
