<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/><emph>I</emph>T is <num value="1">one</num> of the functions of a <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">historical society</orgName> to record history as it transpires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Here in <placeName>Medford</placeName> it is unfortunate that we have so few records of certain memorable periods of our past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>In <dateStruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct> there was no <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">historical society</orgName> existing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Had there been, we might now read in the records of that day at what hour of the morning the <rs>Minute Men</rs> marched up the road toward <placeName>Lexington</placeName>, how far they advanced, and at what point they joined in the attack upon the <rs>British Regulars</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Again we are unable to determine with certainty the builder of the famous <placeName reg="Cradock house">Cradock house</placeName>, or to demonstrate that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> came to the <rs type="place">Royall house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>In later years there are like omissions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>To prevent similar gaps in the future, a <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">historical society</orgName> may perform a valuable function in recording and collating events as they transpire, and before they merge with dim outline into those of later years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In years to come it is likely that our present decade will be fixed as that in which <placeName>Medford</placeName> passed through a stage of transition from the old order to the new. In that process the recent enlarging and rebuilding of <address><street n="Medford square">Medford square</street></address> substitutes in appearance the metropolitan suburb for the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>At the same time the development of outlying areas into residential districts has brought on the breaking up of family estates which through years of long holding have distinguished <placeName>Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Chief among such lands are the tracts that have <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> been held in the <rs>Lawrence</rs> and the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> families, both of which have in <num value="1">one</num> case to a great extent and in the other to a less extent already passed into other hands, subdivided among many separate householders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is of the land holdings of the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> family and in a measure of that family that these pages will attempt to make some record from the earliest days to our own tines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is practicable, however, within the limits of a paper to deal in hardly more than skeleton outline, omitting much that might well be written in full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I do not represent that I am setting forth what is not already known and recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In fact, this paper is based in large part upon the work of <placeName reg="Shepherd Brooks">Shepherd Brooks</placeName>, now preserved in written form under the title <q direct="unspecified">History and Genealogy of the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> Family of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford, Massachusetts</placeName>, compiled chiefly from the researches of <persName n="Brooks,,P.,C.,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00005" reg="expanded:Brooks,Peter,Chardon,,"><foreName>P.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname>, <genName n="senior">senior</genName></persName>, his son, <persName n="Gorham,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00006" reg="nearbymention:Gorham,Ann,,,"><surname>Gorham</surname></persName>, and his nephew, <persName n="Brooks,,William,G.,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00007" reg="default:Brooks,William,G.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, also from <persName n="Brooks,,Charles,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00008" reg="default:Brooks,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>'s History of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, by <placeName reg="Shepherd Brooks">Shepherd Brooks</placeName>, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1885--"><year reg="1885">1885</year></dateStruct>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>That book forms an invaluable record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The house of <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00009" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> reaches back, if not to the earliest years of the settlement, to the later decades of the <num value="16">sixteen</num> hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In all that time the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> family has been <num value="1">one</num> of outstanding prominence and has imprinted itself upon the annals of the town and the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In fact, so associated with the western part of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, in particular, has been the name of <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00010" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, that within our own time, the proposal to divide <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> at <address><street n="Winthrop square">Winthrop square</street></address> and create the town of <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Brooks</placeName> out of the territory lying to the west all but received legal sanction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>By the closest of margins, however, the proposal was not adopted and the territory that was old <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> remains, so far as that proceeding is concerned, the <rs>Medford</rs> of today.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In <dateStruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></dateStruct> <placeName reg="Thomas Brooks">Thomas Brooks</placeName> became the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of this family to acquire land holdings in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> had then progressed from a mere settlement to a scattered hamlet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Near the site of the present square stood <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> the house of <persName n="Cradock,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00011" reg="mostcommon:Cradock,Mathew,,,:1"><surname>Cradock</surname></persName>'s agents and the great barn which sheltered his cattle and farm implements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>On the site of and a part of the present <placeName reg="Royall house">Royall house</placeName> stood <placeName><persName n="Winthrop,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00012" reg="mostcommon:Winthrop,John,,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Scattered elsewhere along the roads, if they may be so called, were other small houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There was, it is said, a rough wagon road leading from the future square along the old <name>Indian</name> trail to the weirs, or fishing ways, where the ponds narrow into the <rs>Mystic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>These had been used from <name>Indian</name> times, as appears from the fact that the use of the weirs was reserved to the <name>Indians</name> in the deed of the <rs>Squa Sachem</rs> to <persName n="Winthrop,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00013" reg="mostcommon:Winthrop,John,,,:3"><surname>Winthrop</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1639--"><year reg="1639">1639</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Near the weirs at that early day stood a corn mill, an undivided <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> part of which passed to the first <rs>Brooks</rs> who became the owner of land in the present territory of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Such was the surrounding country which to the extent of <measure n="400acres" type="area">four hundred acres</measure> <placeName reg="Thomas Brooks">Thomas Brooks</placeName> acquired by deed recorded at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="1660-05-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> day of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1660</year>,</dateStruct> from <placeName reg="Edward Collins">Edward Collins</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The land in question lay on both sides of the road to <placeName key="tgn,2051000" n="1.000 43" reg="woburn, middlesex county, massachusetts">Woburn</placeName>, now called <address><street n="Grove street">Grove street</street></address> but then, or shortly thereafter, known as the road through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><placeName reg="Thomas Brooks">Thomas Brooks</placeName>, it should be said, never settled in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He came over from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> about <dateStruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></dateStruct> in the same company with <persName n="Saltonstall,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00014" reg="mostcommon:Saltonstall,nomatch:0"><surname>Saltonstall</surname></persName> and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Some of those early adventurers settled here, but <placeName reg="Thomas Brooks">Thomas Brooks</placeName>, it appears from the records, had a lot assigned to him on the main road in <placeName reg="Watertown, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014591">Watertown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In <dateStruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></dateStruct> he moved to <placeName reg="Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1123016">Concord</placeName>, where he became a freeman, and lived until his death on <dateStruct value="1667-05-21"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="21">21</day>, <year reg="1667">1667</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He was <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> Representative from <placeName reg="Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1123016">Concord</placeName>, and received various local appointments of trust and honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Although he had a large estate in <placeName reg="Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1123016">Concord</placeName>, he evidently wished to make further provision for his children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Accordingly, with his son-in-law, <persName n="Wheeler,,Timothy,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00015" reg="default:Wheeler,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>, he invested <measure n="404l." type="pounds"><num value="404">four hundred and four</num> pounds</measure> sterling in these acres in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 8" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>&mdash;<num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> for himself and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> for <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00016" reg="nearbymention:Wheeler,Timothy,,,"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He lived for many years on <persName n="Cradock,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00018" reg="mostcommon:Cradock,Mathew,,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Cradock</surname></persName>'s plantation <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> and purchased it from the heirs of the governor in <dateStruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It may have been that fact which led him to part with his holdings to the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The deed from <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00019" reg="nearbymention:Collins,Edwd,,,"><surname>Collins</surname></persName> gives in quaint and formal language the terms of the purchase.
