<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>When, yielding to the solicitations of my friends, I finally decided to write these Memoirs, the greatest difficulty which confronted me was that of recounting my share in the many notable events of the last <measure n="3decades" type="date">three decades</measure>, in which I played a part, without entering too fully into the history of these years, and at the same time without giving to my own acts an unmerited prominence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>To what extent I have overcome this difficulty I must leave the reader to judge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>In offering this record, penned by my own hand, of the events of my life, and of my participation in our great struggle for national existence, human liberty, and political equality, I make no pretension to literary merit; the importance of the subject-matter of my narrative is my only claim on the reader's attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Respectfully dedicating this work to my comrades in arms during the <rs>War</rs> of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, I leave it as a heritage to my children, and as a source of information for the future historian. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>My parents, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Sheridan,,Mary,,," id="n0035.0002.00001.00002" reg="default:Sheridan,Mary,,,"><foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, came to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, having been induced by the representations of my father's uncle, <persName n="Gainor,,Thomas,,," id="n0035.0002.00001.00003" reg="default:Gainor,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Gainor</surname></persName>, then living in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>They were born and reared in the <placeName reg="Cavan,Ulster,Eire,Europe" key="tgn,7003501">County Cavan, Ireland</placeName>, where from early manhood my father had tilled a leasehold on the estate of Cherrymount; and the sale of this leasehold provided him with means to seek a new home across the sea. My parents were blood relationscousins in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> degree &mdash; my mother, whose maiden name was <persName n="Minor,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00001.00004" reg="mostcommon:Minor,nomatch:0"><surname>Minor</surname></persName>, having descended from a collateral branch of my father's family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Before leaving <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> they had <num value="2">two</num> children, and on the <dateStruct value="1831-03-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1831</year>,</dateStruct> the year after their arrival in this country, I was born, in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany, N.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The prospects for gaining a livelihood in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> did not meet the expectations which my parents had been led to entertain, so in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct> they removed to the <rs>West</rs>, to establish themselves in the village of <placeName reg="Somerset, Perry, Ohio" key="tgn,2081927">Somerset, in Perry County, Ohio</placeName>, which section, in the earliest days of the <rs>State</rs>, had been colonized from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>At this <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> period the great <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName> of the <rs>Northwest</rs>--the canals and macadamized roads, a result of clamor for internal improvements &mdash; were in course of construction, and my father turned his attention to them, believing that they offered opportunities for a successful occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Encouraged by a civil engineer named <persName n="Bassett,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00002.00005" reg="mostcommon:Bassett,Isaac,C.,,:3"><surname>Bassett</surname></persName>, who had taken a fancy to him, he put in bids for a small contract on the <rs type="place">Cumberland Road</rs>, known as the <quote><address><street n="National road">National road</street></address>,</quote> which was then being extended west from the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A little success in this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enterprise led him to take up contracting as a business, which he followed on various canals and macadamized roads then building in different parts of the <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">State of Ohio</placeName>, with some good fortune for awhile, but in <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct> what little means he had saved were swallowed up in bankruptcy, caused by the failure of the <orgName n="Sciota and Hocking Valley Railroad" type="railroad">Sciota and Hocking Valley Railroad</orgName> Company, for which he was fulfilling a contract at the time, and this disaster left him finally only a small farm, just outside the village of <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset</placeName>, where he dwelt until his death in <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>My father's occupation kept him away from home much of the time during my boyhood, and as a consequence I grew up under the sole guidance and training of my mother, whose excellent common sense and clear discernment in every way fitted her for such maternal duties.<note anchored="yes" id="n.2.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> 
<p>My mother has died since the above was written.--P. H. S.</p></note> When old enough I was sent to the village school, which was taught by an old-time <persName n="Irish,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Irish,nomatch:0"><surname>Irish</surname></persName> <quote>master</quote> --<num value="1">one</num> of those itinerant dominies of the early frontier &mdash; who, holding that to spare the rod was to spoil the child, if unable to detect the real culprit when any offense had been committed, would consistently apply the switch to the whole school without discrimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It must be conceded that by this means he never failed to catch the guilty mischief-maker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The school-year was divided into terms of <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, the teacher being paid in each term a certain sumthree dollars, I think, for each pupil &mdash; and having an additional perquisite in the privilege of boarding around at his option in the different families to which his scholars belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This feature was more than acceptable to the parents at times, for how else could they so thoroughly learn all the neighborhood gossip?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But the pupils were in almost unanimous opposition, because <persName n="McNanly,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0002.00002.00007" reg="mostcommon:McNanly,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McNanly</surname></persName>'s unheralded advent at any <num value="1">one</num>'s house resulted frequently in the discovery that some favorite child had been playing <quote>hookey,</quote> which means (I will say to the uninitiated, if any such there be) absenting <num value="1">one</num>'s self from school without permission, to go on a fishing or a swimming frolic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Such at least was my experience more than once, for <persName n="McNanly,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0002.00002.00008" reg="mostcommon:McNanly,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McNanly</surname></persName> particularly favored my mother's house, because of a former acquaintanceship in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, and <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> many a time a comparison of notes proved that I had been in the woods with <num value="2">two</num> playfellows, named Binckly and <persName n="Greiner,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00009" reg="mostcommon:Greiner,nomatch:0"><surname>Greiner</surname></persName>, when the master thought I was home, ill, and my mother, that I was at school, deeply immersed in study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>However, with these and other delinquencies not uncommon among boys, I learned at <placeName reg="McNanly's school">McNanly's school</placeName>, and a little later, under a pedagogue named <persName n="Thorn,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00010" reg="mostcommon:Thorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorn</surname></persName>, a smattering of geography and history, and explored the mysteries of <persName n="Pike,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00011" reg="mostcommon:Pike,nomatch:0"><surname>Pike</surname></persName>'s Arithmetic and Bullions' <persName n="Grammar,,English,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00012" reg="default:Grammar,English,,,"><foreName>English</foreName> <surname>Grammar</surname></persName>, about as far as I could be carried up to the age of <num value="14">fourteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This was all the education then bestowed upon me, and this --with the exception of progressing in some of these branches by voluntary study, and by practical application in others, supplemented by a few months of preparation after receiving my appointment as a cadet was the extent of my learning on entering the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When about <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> old I began to do something for myself; <persName n="Talbot,Mister,John,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00013" reg="default:Talbot,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Talbot</surname></persName>, who kept a country store in the village, employing me to deal out sugar, coffee, and calico to his customers at the munificent salary of <measure n="24dollars" type="currency">twenty-four dollars</measure> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>After I had gained a twelvemonths' experience with <persName n="Talbot,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00014" reg="nearbymention:Talbot,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Talbot</surname></persName> my services began to be sought by others, and <persName n="Whitehead,Mister,David,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00015" reg="default:Whitehead,David,,,"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <foreName>David</foreName> <surname>Whitehead</surname></persName> secured them by the offer of <measure n="60dollars" type="currency">sixty dollars</measure> a year &mdash; <persName n="Talbot,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00016" reg="nearbymention:Talbot,John,,,"><surname>Talbot</surname></persName> refusing to increase my pay, but not objecting to my advancement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A few mouths later, before my year was up, another chance to increase my salary came about; <persName n="Dittoe,Mister,Henry,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00017" reg="default:Dittoe,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Dittoe</surname></persName>, the enterprising man of the village, offering me <measure n="120dollars" type="currency">one hundred and twenty dollars</measure> a year to take a position in the <placeName reg="dry-goods store">dry-goods store</placeName> of <persName n="Fink,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00018" reg="mostcommon:Fink,nomatch:0"><surname>Fink</surname></persName> &amp; <persName n="Dittoe,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00019" reg="nearbymention:Dittoe,Henry,,,"><surname>Dittoe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I laid the matter before <persName n="Whitehead,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00020" reg="nearbymention:Whitehead,David,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whitehead</surname></persName>, and he frankly advised me to accept, though he cautioned me that I might regret it, adding that he was afraid <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName> (referring to <persName n="Dittoe,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00021" reg="nearbymention:Dittoe,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dittoe</surname></persName>) <quote>had too many irons in the fire.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>His warning in regard to the enterprising merchant proved a prophecy, for <quote>too many irons in the fire</quote> brought about <persName n="Dittoe,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00022" reg="nearbymention:Dittoe,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dittoe</surname></persName>'s bankruptcy, although this misfortune did not befall him till long after I had left his service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I am glad to say, however, that his failure was an exceptionally honest <num value="1">one</num>, and due more to the fact that he was in advance of his surroundings than to any other cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I remained with <persName n="Fink,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00023" reg="mostcommon:Fink,nomatch:0"><surname>Fink</surname></persName> &amp; <persName n="Dittoe,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00003.00024" reg="nearbymention:Dittoe,Henry,,,"><surname>Dittoe</surname></persName> until I entered the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, principally in charge of the book-keeping, which was no small work for <num value="1">one</num> of my years, considering that in those days the entire business of country stores in the <rs>West</rs> was conducted on the credit system; the customers, being mostly farmers, never expecting to pay till the product of their farms could be brought to market; and even then usually squared the book-accounts by notes of hand, that were often slow of collection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><pb id="p.4" n="4"/> </p> 
<p>From the time I ceased to attend school my employment had necessitated, to a certain degree, the application of what I had learned there, and this practical instruction I reinforced somewhat by doing considerable reading in a general way, until ultimately I became quite a local authority in history, being frequently chosen as arbiter in discussions and disputes that arose in the store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The Mexican War, then going on, furnished, of course, a never-ending theme for controversy, and although I was too young to enter the military service when volunteers were mustering in our section, yet the stirring events of the times so much impressed and absorbed me that my sole wish was to become a soldier, and my highest aspiration to go to <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName> as a Cadet from my <orgName n="Congressional District" type="district">Congressional district</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>My chances for this seemed very remote, however, till <num value="1">one</num> day an opportunity was thrown in my way by the boy who then held the place failing to pass his examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>When I learned that by this occurrence a vacancy existed, I wrote to our representative in Congress, <persName n="Ritchey,the Honorable,Thomas,,," id="n0035.0002.00004.00025" reg="default:Ritchey,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Ritchey</surname></persName>, and asked him for the appointment, reminding him that we had often met in <persName n="Fink,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00004.00026" reg="mostcommon:Fink,nomatch:0"><surname>Fink</surname></persName> &amp; <persName n="Dittoe,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00004.00027" reg="nearbymention:Dittoe,Henry,,,"><surname>Dittoe</surname></persName>'s store, and that therefore he must know something of my qualifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He responded promptly by enclosing my warrant for the class of <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>; so, notwithstanding the many romances that have been published about the matter, to <persName n="Ritchey,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0002.00004.00028" reg="nearbymention:Ritchey,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ritchey</surname></persName>, and to him alone, is due all the credit &mdash; if my career justifies that term &mdash; of putting me in the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>At once I set about preparing for the examination which precedes admission to the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, studying zealously under the direction of <persName n="Clark,Mister,William,,," id="n0035.0002.00004.00029" reg="default:Clark,William,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>; my old teachers, <persName n="McNanly,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00004.00030" reg="mostcommon:McNanly,nomatch:0"><surname>McNanly</surname></persName> and <persName n="Thorn,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00004.00031" reg="mostcommon:Thorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorn</surname></persName>, having disappeared from <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset</placeName> and sought new fields of usefulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The intervening months passed rapidly away, and I fear that I did not make much progress, yet I thought I should be able to pass the preliminary examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>That which was to follow worried me more and gave me many sleepless nights; but these would have been less in number, I fully believe, had it not been for <num value="1">one</num> specification of my outfit which the circular that accompanied my appointment demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This requirement was a pair of <quote><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Monroe</placeName> shoes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Now, out in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, what <quote><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Monroe</placeName> shoes</quote> were was a mystery &mdash; not a shoemaker in my section having so much as an inkling of the construction of the perplexing things, until finally my eldest brother brought an idea of them from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, when it was found that they were a familiar pattern under another name. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>At length the time for my departure came, and I set out for <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName>, going by way of <placeName reg="Cleveland, Cuyahoga, Ohio" key="tgn,7013608">Cleveland</placeName> and across <placeName reg="Lake Erie, United States" key="tgn,2318573">Lake Erie</placeName> to <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>On the steamer I fell in with another appointee <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> to the academy, <persName n="Stanley,,David,S.,," id="n0035.0002.00004.00032" reg="default:Stanley,David,S.,,"><foreName>David</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, also from <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>; and when our acquaintanceship had <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> ripened somewhat, and we had begun to repose confidence in each other, I found out that he had no <quote><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Monroe</placeName> shoes,</quote> so I deemed myself just that much ahead of my companion, although my shoes might not conform exactly to the regulations in Eastern style and finish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>At <persName n="Stanley,,Buffalo,,," id="n0035.0002.00005.00033" reg="default:Stanley,Buffalo,,,"><foreName>Buffalo</foreName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName> and I separated, he going by the <rs type="place">Erie Canal</rs> and I by the railroad, since I wanted to gain time on account of commands to stop in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> to see my father's uncle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Here I spent a few days, till <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00005.00034" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Buffalo,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> reached <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, when we journeyed together down the river to <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The examination began a few days after our arrival, and I soon found myself admitted to the <rs>Corps</rs> of Cadets, to date from <dateStruct value="1848-07-01"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>, in a class composed of <num value="63">sixty-three</num> members, many of whom &mdash; for example, <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00005.00035" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Buffalo,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, <persName n="Slocum,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00005.00036" reg="nearbymention:Slocum,Henry,W.,,"><surname>Slocum</surname></persName>, Woods, <persName n="Kautz,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00005.00037" reg="mostcommon:Kautz,nomatch:0"><surname>Kautz</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Crook,,,,," id="n0035.0002.00005.00038" reg="nearbymention:Crook,George,,,"><surname>Crook</surname></persName> became prominent generals in later years, and commanded divisions, corps, and armies in the war of the rebellion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Our outpost at La Pena was intended as a protection against the predatory incursions of these savages, so almost constant scouting became a daily occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>This enabled me soon to become familiar with and make maps of the surrounding country, and, through constant association with our <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> guide, to pick up in a short time quite a smattering of the <rs>Spanish</rs> language, which was very useful to <num value="1">one</num> serving on that frontier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>At that early day <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826"><rs type="direction">western</rs> Texas</placeName> was literally filled with game, and the region in the immediate vicinity of La Pena contained its full proportion of deer, antelope, and wild turkeys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The temptation to hunt was <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> therefore constantly before me, and a desire to indulge in this pastime, whenever free from the legitimate duty of the camp, soon took complete possession of me, so expeditions in pursuit of game were of frequent occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>In these expeditions I was always accompanied by a soldier named Frankman, belonging to <quote>D</quote> company, who was a fine sportsman, and a butcher by trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>In a short period I learned from Frankman how to approach and secure the different species of game, and also how to dress and care for it when killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Almost every expedition we made was rewarded with a good supply of deer, antelope, and wild turkeys, and we furnished the command in camp with such abundance that it was relieved from the necessity of drawing its beef ration, much to the discomfiture of the disgruntled beef contractor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The camp at La Pena was on sandy ground, unpleasant for men and animals, and by my advice it was moved to La Pendencia, not far from <placeName reg="Lake Espantosa">Lake Espantosa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Before removal from our old location, however, early <num value="1">one</num> bright morning Frankman and I started on <num value="1">one</num> of our customary expeditions, going down <placeName reg="La Pena Creek">La Pena Creek</placeName> to a small creek, at the head of which we had established a hunting rendezvous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>After proceeding along the stream for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> we saw a column of smoke on the prairie, and supposing it arose from a camp of <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> rancheros catching wild horses or wild cattle, and even wild mules, which were very numerous in that section of country along the <placeName reg="East Prong Nueces River, Texas, United States" key="tgn,2308902">Nueces River</placeName>, we thought we would join the party and see how much success they were having, and observe the methods employed in this laborious and sometimes dangerous vocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>With this object in view, we continued on until we found it necessary to cross to the other side of the creek to reach the point indicated by the smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Just before reaching the crossing I discovered moccasin tracks near the water's edge, and realizing in an instant that the camp we were approaching might possibly be <num value="1">one</num> of hostile <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0003.00012.00065" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>--all Indians in that country at that time were hostile &mdash; Frankman and I backed out silently, and made eager strides for La Pena, where we had scarcely arrived when <persName n="Buren,Captain,M.,E.,,Van" id="n0035.0003.00012.00066" reg="expanded:Buren,M.,E.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Mounted Rifle</rs> regiment, came in with a small command, and reported that he was out in pursuit of a band of <persName n="Indians,,Comanche,,," id="n0035.0003.00012.00067" reg="default:Indians,Comanche,,,"><foreName>Comanche</foreName> <surname>Indians</surname></persName>, which had been committing depredations up about <placeName key="tgn,2335195" n="1.000 2" reg="fort clark, dare, north carolina">Fort Clark</placeName>, but that he had lost the trail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>I immediately informed him of what had occurred to me during the morning, and that I could put him on the trail of the <name>Indians</name> he was desirous of punishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>We hurriedly supplied with rations his small command of <num value="13">thirteen</num> men, and I then conducted him to the point where I had seen the smoke, and there we found signs indicating it to be the recently abandoned camp of the <name>Indians</name> he was pursuing, and we also noticed that prairie rats had formed the principal article of diet <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> at the meal they had just completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>As they had gone, I could do no more than put him on the trail made in their departure, which was well marked; for <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0003.00013.00068" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, when in small parties, and unless pressed, usually follow each other in single file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Their number was double that of <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>'s detachment, but he attacked them fearlessly, and in the fight was mortally wounded by an arrow which entered his body in front, just above the sword belt, and came through the belt behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The principal chief of the <name>Indians</name> was killed, and the rest fled.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>After our removal to La Pendencia a similar pursuit of savages occurred, but with more fortunate results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/><persName n="King,Colonel,John,H.,," id="n0035.0003.00013.00071" reg="default:King,John,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>King</surname></persName>, now on the retired list, then a captain in the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Infantry</orgName>, came to our camp in pursuit of a marauding band of hostile <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0003.00013.00072" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, and I was enabled to put him also on the trail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>He soon overtook them, and killing <num value="2">two</num> without loss to himself, the band dispersed like a flock of quail and left him nothing to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>He returned to our camp shortly after, and the few friendly <name>Indian</name> scouts he had with him held a grand pow-wow and dance over the scalps of the fallen braves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Around La Pendencia, as at La Pena, the country abounded in deer, antelope, wild turkeys, and quail, and we killed enough to supply abundantly the whole command with the meat portion of the ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Some mornings Frankman and I would bring in as many as <num value="7">seven</num> deer, and our hunting expeditions made me so familiar with the region between our camp and <placeName key="tgn,2103904" n="1.000 4" reg="eagle pass, maverick, texas">Fort Duncan</placeName>, the headquarters of the regiment, that I was soon enabled to suggest a more direct route of communication than the circuitous <num value="1">one</num> then traversed, and in a short time it was established. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Up to this time I had been on detached duty, but soon my own company was ordered into the field to occupy a position on <placeName key="tgn,2732814;tgn,2732813" n="0.130 000000.2603	placename;tgn,2732814;Turkey Creek, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.130 000000.2603	placename;tgn,2732813;Turkey Creek, King William, Virginia,King William,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Turkey Creek, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Turkey Creek, King William, Virginia,King William,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">Turkey Creek</placeName>, about <num value="10">ten</num> or <placeName><distance reg="12miles">twelve miles</distance> <offset>west</offset> of  the <placeName reg="East Prong Nueces River, Texas, United States" key="tgn,2308902">Nueces River</placeName></placeName>, on the road from <placeName reg="San Antonio, Bexar, Texas" key="tgn,7014453">San Antonio</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2103904" n="1.000 4" reg="eagle pass, maverick, texas">Fort Duncan</placeName>, and I was required to join the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Here constant work and scouting were necessary, as our camp was specially located with reference to protecting from <name>Indian</name> raids the road running from <placeName reg="San Antonio, Bexar, Texas" key="tgn,7014453">San Antonio</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2103904" n="1.000 4" reg="eagle pass, maverick, texas">Fort Duncan</placeName>, and on to the interior of <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 6" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>In those days this road was the great line of travel, and <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> caravans were frequently passing over it, to and from, in such a disorganized condition as often to invite attack from marauding Comanches and Lipans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Our time, therefore, was incessantly occupied in scouting, but our labors were much lightened because they were directed <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> with intelligence and justice by <persName n="McLean,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0003.00014.00073" reg="nearbymention:McLean,Eugene,E.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>McLean</surname></persName>, whose agreeable manners and upright methods are still so impressed on my memory that to this day I look back upon my service with <quote>D</quote> Company of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Infantry</orgName> as among those events which I remember with most pleasure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>In this manner my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> summer of active field duty passed rapidly away, and in the fall my company returned to <placeName key="tgn,2103904" n="1.000 4" reg="eagle pass, maverick, texas">Fort Duncan</placeName> to go into winter quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>These quarters, when constructed, consisted of <quote>A</quote> tents pitched under a shed improvised by the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>With only these accommodations I at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lived around as best I could until the command was quartered, and then, requesting a detail of wagons from the quartermaster, I went out some <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> to get poles to build a more comfortable habitation for myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>In a few days enough poles for the construction of a modest residence were secured and brought in, and then the building of my house began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, the poles were cut the proper length, planted in a trench around <num value="4">four</num> sides of a square of very small proportions, and secured at the top by string-pieces stretched from <num value="1">one</num> angle to another, in which half-notches had been made at proper intervals to receive the uprights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The poles were then made rigid by strips nailed on half-way to the ground, giving the sides of the structure firmness, but the interstices were large and frequent; still, with the aid of some old condemned paulins obtained from the quartermaster, the walls were covered and the necessity for chinking obviated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>This method of covering the holes in the side walls also possessed the advantage of permitting some little light to penetrate to the interior of the house, and avoided the necessity of constructing a window, for which, by the way, no glass could have been obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Next a good large fire-place and chimney were built in <num value="1">one</num> corner by means of stones and mud, and then the roof was put on &mdash; a thatched <num value="1">one</num> of prairie grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The floor was dirt compactly tamped. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>My furniture was very primitive: a chair or <num value="2">two</num>, with about the same number of camp stools, a cot, and a rickety old bureau that I obtained in some way not now remembered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>My washstand consisted of a board about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> long, resting on legs formed by driving sticks into the ground until they held it at about the proper height from the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>This washstand was the mostexpensive piece of furniture I owned, the board having cost me <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure>, and even then I obtained it as a favor, for lumber on the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> was so scarce in those days that to possess even the smallest quantity was to indulge in great luxury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Indeed, about all that reached the post was what came in the shape of bacon boxes, and the boards from these were reserved for coffins in which to bury our dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/><pb id="p.15" n="15"/> </p> 
<p>In this rude habitation I spent a happy winter, and was more comfortably off than many of the officers, who had built none, but lived in tents and took the chances of <quote>Northers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>During this period our food was principally the soldier's ration: flour, pickled pork, nasty bacon-cured in the dust of ground charcoal-and fresh beef, of which we had a plentiful supply, supplemented with game of various kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The sugar, coffee, and smaller parts of the ration were good, but we had no vegetables, and the few jars of preserves and some few vegetables kept by the sutler were too expensive to be indulged in. So during all the period I lived at <placeName key="tgn,2103904" n="1.000 4" reg="eagle pass, maverick, texas">Fort Duncan</placeName> and its sub-camps, nearly <measure n="16months" type="date">sixteen months</measure>, fresh vegetables were practically unobtainable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>To prevent scurvy we used the juice of the maguey plant, called pulque, and to obtain a supply of this anti-scorbutic I was often detailed to march the company out about <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>, cut the plant, load up <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> wagons with the stalks, and carry them to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Here the juice was extracted by a rude press, and put in bottles until it fermented and became worse in odor than sulphureted hydrogen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>At reveille roll-call every morning this fermented liquor was dealt out to the company, and as it was my duty, in my capacity of subaltern, to attend these roll-calls and see that the men took their ration of pulque, I always began the duty by drinking a cup of the repulsive stuff myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Though hard to swallow, its well-known specific qualities in the prevention and cure of scurvy were familiar to all, so every man in the command gulped down his share notwithstanding its vile taste and odor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Considering our isolation, the winter passed very pleasantly to us all. The post was a large <num value="1">one</num>, its officers congenial, and we had many enjoyable occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Dances, races, and horseback riding filled in much of the time, and occasional raids from Indians furnished more serious occupation in the way of a scout now and then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The proximity of the <name>Indians</name> at times rendered the surrounding country somewhat dangerous for individuals or small parties at a distance from the fort; but few thought the savages would come near, so many risks were doubtless run by various officers, who carried the familiar <num value="6">six</num>-shooter as their only weapon while out horseback riding, until suddenly we were awakened to the dangers we had been incurring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>About mid-winter a party of hostile Lipans made a swoop around and skirting the garrison, killing a herder-a discharged drummer boyin sight of the flag-staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Of course great excitement followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/><persName n="Walker,Captain,J.,G.,," id="n0035.0003.00015.00074" reg="default:Walker,J.,G.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="mil" key="MountedRifles">Mounted Rifles</orgName>, immediately started with his company in pursuit of the <name>Indians</name>, and I was directed to accompany the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Not far away we found the body of the boy filled with arrows, and near him the body of a fine looking young <address><street n="Indian burial">Indian</street></address>, whom the lad had undoubtedly <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> killed before he was himself overpowered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>We were not a great distance behind the <name>Indians</name> when the boy's body was discovered, and having good trailers we gained on them rapidly, with the prospect of overhauling them, but as soon as they found we were getting near they headed for the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, made the crossing to the opposite bank, and were in <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 6" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName> before we could overtake them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>When on the other side of the boundary they grew very brave, daring us to come over to fight them, well aware all the time that the international line prevented us from continuing the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>So we had to return to the post without reward for our exertion except the consciousness of having made the best effort we could to catch the murderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>That night, in company with <persName n="Williams,Lieutenant,Thomas,G.,," id="n0035.0003.00016.00075" reg="default:Williams,Thomas,G.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>, I crossed over the river to the <rs>Mexican</rs> village of <placeName key="tgn,1018033" n="1.000 1" reg="piedras negras,coahuila,mexico,north and central america">Piedras Negras</placeName>, and on going to a house where a large <hi rend="italics">baille</hi>, or dance, was going on we found among those present <num value="2">two</num> of the <name>Indians</name> we had been chasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>As soon as they saw us they strung their bows for a fight, and we drew our <num value="6">six</num>-shooters, but the <name>Mexicans</name> quickly closed in around the <name>Indians</name> and forced them out of the house &mdash; or rude <hi rend="italics">jackal &mdash; where</hi> the <quote>ball</quote> was being held, and they escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>We learned later something about the nature of the fight the drummer had made, and that his death had cost them dear, for, in addition to the <rs>Indian</rs> killed and lying by his side, he had mortally wounded another and seriously wounded <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, with the <num value="3">three</num> shots that he had fired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>At this period I took up the notion of making a study of ornithology, incited to it possibly by the great number of bright-colored birds that made their winter homes along the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, and I spent many a leisure hour in catching specimens by means of stick traps, with which I found little difficulty in securing almost every variety of the feathered tribes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>I made my traps by placing <num value="4">four</num> sticks of a length suited to the size desired so as to form a square, and building up on them in log-cabin fashion until the structure came almost to a point by contraction of the corners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Then the sticks were made secure, the trap placed at some secluded spot, and from the centre to the outside a trench was dug in the ground, and thinly covered when a depth had been obtained that would leave an aperture sufficiently large to admit the class of birds desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Along this trench seeds and other food were scattered, which the birds soon discovered, and of course began to eat, unsuspectingly following the tempting bait through the gallery till they emerged from its farther end in the centre of the trap, where they contentedly fed till the food was all gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Then the fact of imprisonment <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> presented itself, and they vainly endeavored to escape through the interstices of the cage, never once guided by their instinct to return to liberty through the route by which they had entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Among the different kinds of birds <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> captured in this way, mocking-birds, blue-birds, robins, meadow larks, quail, and plover were the most numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>They seemed to have more voracious appetites than other varieties, or else they were more unwary, and consequently more easily caught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>A change of station, however, put an end to my ornithological plans, and activities of other kinds prevented me from resuming them in after life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>There were quite a number of young officers at the post during the winter, and as our relations with the <rs>Mexican</rs> commandant at <placeName key="tgn,1018033" n="1.000 1" reg="piedras negras,coahuila,mexico,north and central america">Piedras Negras</placeName> were most amicable, we were often invited to dances at his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>He and his hospitable wife and daughter drummed up the female portion of the elite of <placeName key="tgn,1018033" n="1.000 1" reg="piedras negras,coahuila,mexico,north and central america">Piedras Negras</placeName> and provided the house, which was the official as well as the personal residence of the commandant, while we &mdash; the young officers &mdash; furnished the music and such sweetmeats, candies, &amp;c., for the <hi rend="italics">baille</hi> as the country would afford. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>We generally danced in a long hall on a hard dirt floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The girls sat on <num value="1">one</num> side of the hall, chaperoned by their mothers or some old duennas, and the men on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>When the music struck up each man asked the lady whom his eyes had already selected to dance with him, and it was not etiquette for her to refuse &mdash; no engagements being allowed before the music began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>When the dance, which was generally a long waltz, was over, he seated his partner, and then went to a little counter at the end of the room and bought his dulcinea a plate of the candies and sweetmeats provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Sometimes she accepted them, but most generally pointed to her duenna or chaperon behind, who held up her apron and caught the refreshments as they were slid into it from the plate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The greatest decorum was maintained at these dances, primitively as they were conducted; and in a region so completely cut off from the world, their influence was undoubtedly beneficial to a considerable degree in softening the rough edges in <num value="0.5">a half</num>-breed population. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The inhabitants of this frontier of <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 6" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName> were strongly marked with <name>Indian</name> characteristics, particularly with those of the <name>Comanche</name> type, and as the wild <name>Indian</name> blood predominated, few of the physical traits of the <name>Spaniard</name> remained among them, and outlawry was common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The Spanish conquerors had left on the northern border only their graceful manners and their humility before the cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The sign of Christianity was prominently placed at all important points on roads or trails, and especially where any <num value="1">one</num> had been killed; and as the <rs>Comanche Indians</rs>, strong and warlike, had devastated <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893"><rs type="direction">northeastern</rs> Mexico</placeName> in past years, all along the border, on both sides of the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, the murderous effects of their raids were evidenced by numberless crosses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>For more than a century forays had been made on the settlements and towns by these bloodthirsty savages, and, the <rs>Mexican Government</rs> being too weak <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> to afford protection, property was destroyed, the women and children carried off or ravished, and the men compelled to look on in an agony of helplessness till relieved by death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>During all this time, however, the forms and ceremonials of religion, and the polite manners received from the <name>Spaniards</name>, were retained, and reverence for the emblems of Christianity was always uppermost in the mind of even the most ignorant. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> at <placeName reg="Fort Reading">Fort Reading</placeName> seemed reluctant to let me go on to relieve <persName n="Hood,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0035.0004.00020.00085" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, as the country to be passed over was infested by the <placeName key="tgn,7017900" n="1.000 5" reg="pit river, lassen, california">Pit River</placeName> <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00020.00086" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, known to be hostile to white people and especially to small parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>I was very anxious to proceed, however, and willing to take the chances; so, consent being finally obtained, I started with a corporal and <num value="2">two</num> mounted men, through a wild and uninhabited region, to overtake if possible <persName n="Williamson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0035.0004.00020.00087" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Being on horseback, and unencumbered by luggage of any kind except blankets and a little hard bread, coffee and <rs n="smoking tobacco" type="product">smoking-tobacco</rs>, which were all carried on our riding animals, we were sanguine of succeeding, for we traversed in <num value="1">one</num> day fully the distance made in <num value="3">three</num> by <persName n="Williamson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0035.0004.00020.00088" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s party on foot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day we reached the base of Lassan's Butte, where I determined to spend the night near an isolated cabin, or dugout, that had been recently constructed by a hardy pioneer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The wind was blowing a disagreeable gale, which had begun early in the day. This made it desirable to locate our camp under the best cover we could find, and I spent some little time in looking about for a satisfactory place, but nothing better offered than a large fallen tree, which lay in such a direction that by encamping on its lee side we would be protected from the fury of the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>This spot was therefore fixed upon, and preparation made for spending the night as comfortably as the circumstances would permit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>After we had unsaddled I visited the cabin to inquire in regard to the country ahead, and there found at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> only a soldier of <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00020.00089" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s party; later the proprietor of the ranch appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The soldier I had been left behind by the surveying party on account of illness, with instructions to make his way back to <placeName reg="Fort Reading">Fort Reading</placeName> as best he could when he recovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>This condition having greatly improved, however, since he had been left, he now begged me in beseeching terms to take him along with my party, which I finally consented to do, provided that if he became unable to keep up with me, and I should be obliged to abandon <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> him, the responsibility would be his, not mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>This increased my number to <num value="5">five</num>, and was quite a reinforcement should we run across any hostile <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00021.00090" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>; but it was also certain to prove an embarrassment should the man again fall ill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>During the night, notwithstanding the continuance of the storm, I had a very sound and refreshing sleep behind the protecting log where we made our camp, and at daylight next morning we resumed our journey, fortified by a breakfast of coffee and hard bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>I skirted around the base of Lassan's Butte, thence down <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Hat Creek</placeName>, all the time following the trail made by <persName n="Williamson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0035.0004.00021.00091" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>About noon the soldier I had picked up at my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> camp gave out, and could go no farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>As stipulated when I consented to take him along, I had the right to abandon him, but when it came to the test I could not make up my mind to do it. Finding a good place not far off the trail, <num value="1">one</num> of my men volunteered to remain with him until he died; and we left them there, with a liberal supply of hard bread and coffee, believing that we would never again see the invalid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>My reinforcement was already gone, and another man with it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>With my diminished party I resumed the trail and followed it until about <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> in the afternoon, when we heard the sound of voices, and the corporal, thinking we were approaching <persName n="Wllliamson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0035.0004.00021.00092" reg="mostcommon:Wllliamson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Wllliamson</surname></persName>'s party, was so overjoyed in anticipation of the junction, that he wanted to fire his musket as an expression of his delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>This I prevented his doing, however, and we continued cautiously and slowly on to develop the source of the sounds in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>We had not gone far before I discovered that the noise came from a band of <placeName reg="Pit River, Lassen, California" key="tgn,7017900">Pit River</placeName> <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00021.00093" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, who had struck the trail of the surveying expedition, and were following it up, doubtless with evil intent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Dismounting from my horse I counted the moccasin tracks to ascertain the number of <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00021.00094" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, discovered it to be about <num value="30">thirty</num>, and then followed on behind them cautiously, but with little difficulty, as appearances of speed on their part indicated that they wished to overtake <persName n="Williamson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0035.0004.00021.00095" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s party, which made them less on the lookout than usual for any possible pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>After following the trail until nearly sundown, I considered it prudent to stop for the night, and drew off some little distance, where, concealed in a dense growth of timber, we made our camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>As I had with me now only <num value="2">two</num> men, I felt somewhat nervous, so I allowed no fires to be built, and in consequence our supper consisted of hard bread only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>I passed an anxious night, but beyond our own solicitude there was nothing to disturb us, the <name>Indians</name> being too much interested in overtaking the party in front to seek for victims in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>After a hard-bread breakfast we started again on the trail, and had <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> proceeded but a short distance when, hearing the voices of the <name>Indians</name>, we at once slackened our speed so as not to overtake them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Most of the trail on which we traveled during the morning ran over an exceedingly rough lava formation &mdash; a spur of the lava beds often described during the <name>Modoc</name> war of <dateStruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></dateStruct>-so hard and flinty that <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00022.00096" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s large command made little impression on its surface, leaving in fact, only indistinct traces of its line of march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>By care and frequent examinations we managed to follow his route through without much delay, or discovery by the <name>Indians</name>, and about noon, owing to the termination of the lava formation, we descended into the valley of <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Hat Creek</placeName>, a little below where it emerges from the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> cafion and above its confluence with <placeName reg="Pit River, Lassen, California" key="tgn,7017900">Pit River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>As soon as we reached the fertile soil of the valley, we found <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00022.00097" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s trail well defined, deeply impressed in the soft loam, and coursing through wild-flowers and luxuriant grass which carpeted the ground on every hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>When we struck this delightful locality we traveled with considerable speed, and after passing over hill and vale for some distance, the trail becoming more and more distinct all the time, I suddenly saw in front of me the <placeName key="tgn,7017900" n="1.000 5" reg="pit river, lassen, california">Pit River</placeName> <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00022.00098" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>This caused a halt, and having hurriedly re-capped our guns and <num value="6">six</num>-shooters, thus preparing for the worst, I took a look at the band through my fieldglass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>They were <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half-mile</measure> or more in our front and numbered about <num value="30">thirty</num> individuals, armed with bows and arrows only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Observing us they made friendly demonstrations, but I had not implicit faith in a Pit River Indian at that period of the settlement of our country, and especially in that wild locality, so after a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> with the corporal and man, I concluded to advance to a point about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure> from the party, when, relying on the speed of our horses rather than on the peaceable intentions of the savages, I hoped to succeed in cutting around them and take the trail beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Being on foot they could not readily catch us, and inasmuch as their arrows were good for a range of only about <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure>, I had no fear of any material damage on that score. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>On reaching the place selected for our flank movement we made a dash to the left of the trail, through the widest part of the valley and ran our horses swiftly by, but I noticed that the indians did not seem to be disturbed by the manoeuvre and soon realized that this indifference was occasioned by the knowledge that we could not cross <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Hat Creek</placeName>, a deep stream with vertical banks, too broad to be leaped by our horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We were obliged, therefore, to halt, and the <name>Indians</name> again made demonstrations of friendship, some of them even getting into the stream to show that they were at the ford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Thus reassured, we regained our confidence and boldly crossed the river in the midst of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>After <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> we had gained the bluff on the other side of the creek, I looked down into the valley of <placeName reg="Pit River, Lassen, California" key="tgn,7017900">Pit River</placeName>, and could plainly see the camp of the surveying party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Its proximity was the influence which had doubtless caused the peaceable conduct of the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Probably the only thing that saved us was their ignorance of our being in their rear, until we stumbled on them almost within sight of the large party under <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00023.00099" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7017900" n="1.000 5" reg="pit river, lassen, california">Pit River</placeName> Indians were very hostile at that time, and for many succeeding years their treachery and cruelty brought misfortune and misery to the white settlers who ventured their lives in search of home and fortune in the wild and isolated section over which these savages roamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Not long after <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00023.00100" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s party passed through their country, the <rs>Government</rs> was compelled to send into it a considerable force for the purpose of keeping them under control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The outcome of this was a severe fight &mdash; resulting in the loss of a good many lives &mdash; between the, hostiles and a party of our troops under <persName n="Crook,Lieutenant,George,,," id="n0035.0004.00023.00101" reg="default:Crook,George,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Crook</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It finally ended in the establishment of a military post in the vicinity of the battle-ground, for the permanent occupation of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>A great load was lifted from my heart when I found myself so near <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00023.00102" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s camp, which I joined <dateStruct value="1855-08-04"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, receiving a warm welcome from the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>During the afternoon I relieved <persName n="Hood,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0035.0004.00023.00103" reg="nearbymention:Hood,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> of the command of the personal escort, and he was ordered to return, with <num value="12">twelve</num> of the mounted men, over the trail I had followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>I pointed out to him on the map the spot where he would find the <num value="2">two</num> men left on the roadside, and he was directed to take them into <placeName reg="Fort Reading">Fort Reading</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>They were found without difficulty, and carried in to the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The sick man &mdash; <persName n="Duryea,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00023.00104" reg="mostcommon:Duryea,nomatch:0"><surname>Duryea</surname></persName> &mdash; whom I had expected never to see again, afterward became the hospital steward at <placeName reg="Fort Yamhill, Oregon">Fort Yamhill, Oregon</placeName>, when I was stationed there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> that I had passed at the ford came to the bluff above the camp, and arranging themselves in a squatting posture, looked down upon <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00023.00105" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName>'s party with longing eyes, in expectation of a feast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They were a pitiable lot, almost naked, hungry and cadaverous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Indians are always hungry, but these poor creatures were particularly so, as their usual supply of food had grown very scarce from <num value="1">one</num> cause and another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>In prosperity they mainly subsisted on fish, or game killed with the bow and arrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>When these sources failed they lived on grasshoppers, and at this season the grasshopper was their principal food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>In former years salmon were very abundant in the streams of the <rs type="place">Sacramento valley</rs>, and every fall they took great quantities of these fish and dried them for winter use, but alluvial mining had of late years defiled the water of the different streams and driven the fish out. On this account the usual supply of salmon was very limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>They got some trout high up <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> on the rivers, above the sluices and rockers of the miners, but this was a precarious source from which to derive food, as their means of taking the trout were very primitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>They had neither hooks nor lines, but depended entirely on a contrivance made from long, slender branches of willow, which grew on the banks of most of the streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/><num value="1">One</num> of these branches would be cut, and after sharpening the butt-end to a point, split a certain distance, and by a wedge the prongs divided sufficiently to admit a fish between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The <name>Indian</name> fisherman would then slyly put the forked end in the water over his intended victim, and with a quick dart firmly wedge him between the prongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>When secured there, the work of landing him took but a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>When trout were plentiful this primitive mode of taking them was quite successful, and I have often known hundreds of pounds to be caught in this way, but when they were scarce and suspicious the rude method was not rewarded with good results. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The band looking down on us evidently had not had much fish or game to eat for some time, so when they had made <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0004.00024.00106" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,R.,S.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName> understand that they were suffering for food he permitted them to come into camp, and furnished them with a supply, which they greedily swallowed as fast as it was placed at their service, regardless of possible indigestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>When they had eaten all they could hold, their enjoyment was made complete by the soldiers, who gave them a quantity of strong plug tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>This they smoked incessantly, inhaling all the smoke, so that none of the effect should be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>When we abandoned this camp the next day, the miserable wretches remained in it and collected the offal about the cooks' fires to feast still more, piecing out the meal, no doubt, with their staple article of food &mdash; grasshoppers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>His eccentricities constantly supplied us with a variety of amusements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Among the pastimes he indulged in was <num value="1">one</num> which exhibited his skill with the rifle, and at the same time protected the camp from the intrusions and ravages of a drove of razor-backed hogs which belonged to <persName n="Switzler,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0005.00029.00116" reg="mostcommon:Switzler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Switzler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>These hogs were frequent visitors, and very destructive to our grassy sward, rooting it up in front of our tents and all about us, in pursuit of bulbous roots and offal from the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Old Red conceived the idea that it would be well to disable the pigs by shooting off the tips of their snouts, and the proceeded to put his conception into execution, and continued it daily whenever the hogs made their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Of course their owner made a row about it; but when Old Red daily settled for his fun by paying liberally with gold-dust from some small bottles of the precious metal in his possession, <persName n="Switzler,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00029.00117" reg="mostcommon:Switzler,nomatch:0"><surname>Switzler</surname></persName> readily became contented, and I think even encouraged the exhibitions of skill. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>This food consisted principally of dried salmon-pulverized and packed in sacks made of grass &mdash; dried huckleberries, and dried camas; the latter a bulbous root about the size of a small onion, which, when roasted and ground, is made into bread by the <name>Indians</name> and has a taste somewhat like cooked chestnuts. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>After the encounter which I just now referred to, the command, which had halted to learn the results of my chase, resumed its march to and through the <name>Klikitat</name> canion, and into the lower <placeName reg="Yakima Valley, Yakima, Washington" key="tgn,2784087">Yakima Valley</placeName>, in the direction of the <placeName key="tgn,1131977" n="1.000 1" reg="yakima, washington, united states">Yakima River</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The soil in the valley was light and dry, and the movement of animals over it raised great clouds of dust, that rendered it very difficult to distinguish friend from foe; and as I was now separated from the <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> main column a considerable distance, I deemed it prudent to call a halt until we could discover the direction taken by the principal body of the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We soon learned that they had gone up the valley, and looking that way, we discovered a column of alkali dust approaching us, about a mile distant, interposing between my little detachment and the point where I knew <persName n="Rains,General,,,," id="n0035.0005.00031.00124" reg="nearbymention:Rains,Gabriel,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName> intended to encamp for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>There seemed no alternative left us but to get back to our friends by charging through these <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00031.00126" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>; and as their cloud of dust was much larger than ours, this appeared a desperate chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Preparations to charge were begun, however, but, much to our surprise, before they were completed the approaching party halted for a moment and then commenced to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>This calmed the throbbing of our hearts, and with a wild cheer we started in a hot pursuit, that continued for about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, when to our great relief we discovered that we were driving into <persName n="Rains,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00031.00127" reg="nearbymention:Rains,Gabriel,J.,,"><surname>Rains</surname></persName>'s camp a squadron of <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Nesmith,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00031.00128" reg="nearbymention:Nesmith,James,W.,,"><surname>Nesmith</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName> of <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName> volunteers that we had mistaken for <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00031.00129" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Comanche,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, and who in turn believed us to be the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>When camp was reached, we all indulged in a hearty laugh over the affair, and at the fright each party had given the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The explanations which ensued proved that the squadron of volunteers had separated from the column at the same time that I had when we debouched from the caion, and had pursued an intermediate trail through the hills, which brought it into the <rs type="place">valley of the Yakima</rs> at a point higher up the river than where I had struck it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Next day we resumed our march up the valley, parallel to the <rs>Yakima</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>About <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time> we saw a large body of Indians on the opposite side of the river, and the general commanding made up his mind to cross and attack them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The stream was cold, deep, and swift, still I succeeded in passing my dragoons over safely, but had hardly got them well on the opposite bank when the <name>Indians</name> swooped down upon us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> now fell back to a high ridge, on the crest of which they marched and countermarched, threatening to charge down its face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Most of them were naked, and as their persons were painted in gaudy <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> colors and decorated with strips of <rs n="red flannel" type="product">red flannel</rs>, red blankets and gay warbonnets, their appearance presented a scene of picturesque barbarism, fascinating but repulsive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>As they numbered about <num value="600">six hundred</num>, the chances of whipping them did not seem overwhelmingly in our favor, yet <persName n="Nesmith,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00032.00132" reg="nearbymention:Nesmith,James,W.,,"><surname>Nesmith</surname></persName> and I concluded we would give them a little fight, provided we could engage them without going beyond the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>But all our efforts were in vain, for as we advanced they retreated, and as we drew back they reappeared and renewed their parade and noisy demonstrations, all the time beating their drums and yelling lustily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>They could not be tempted into a fight where we desired it, however, and as we felt unequal to any pursuit beyond the ridge without the assistance of the infantry and artillery, we recrossed the river and encamped with <persName n="Rains,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00032.00133" reg="nearbymention:Rains,Gabriel,J.,,"><surname>Rains</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It soon became apparent that the noisy demonstrations of the <name>Indians</name> were intended only as a blind to cover the escape of their women and children to a place of safety in the mountains. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Next morning we took up our march without crossing the river; and as our route would lead us by the point on the opposite bank where the <name>Indians</name> had made their picturesque display the day before, they at an early hour came over to our side, and rapidly moved ahead of us to some distant hills, leaving in our pathway some of the more venturesome young braves, who attempted to retard our advance by opening fire at long range from favorable places where they lay concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>This fire did us little harm, but it had the effect of making our progress so slow that the patience of every <num value="1">one</num> but <persName n="Rains,General,,,," id="n0035.0005.00032.00134" reg="nearbymention:Rains,Gabriel,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName> was wellnigh exhausted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>About <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> in the afternoon we arrived well up near the base of the range of hills, and though it was growing late we still had time to accomplish something, but our commanding officer decided that it was best to go into camp, and make a systematic attack next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>I proposed that he let me charge with my dragoons through the narrow cafion where the river broke through the range, while the infantry should charge up the hill and drive the enemy from the top down on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>In this way I thought we might possibly catch some of the fugitives, but his extreme caution led him to refuse the suggestion, so we pitched our tents out of range of their desultory fire, but near enough to observe plainly their menacing and tantalizing exhibitions of contempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>In addition to firing occasionally, they called us all sorts of bad names, made indecent gestures, and aggravated us, so that between <time value="3">3</time> and <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> in the afternoon, by an inexplicable concert of action, and with a serious breach of discipline, a large number of the men and many of the officers broke <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> from the camp with loud yells and <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> charged the offending savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>As soon as this mob got within musketshot they opened fire on the <name>Indians</name>, who ran down the other face of the ridge without making the slightest resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The hill was readily taken by this unmilitary proceeding, and no <num value="1">one</num> was hurt on either side, but as <persName n="Rains,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00033.00135" reg="nearbymention:Rains,Gabriel,J.,,"><surname>Rains</surname></persName> would not permit it to be held, a large bonfire was lighted on the crest in celebration of the victory, and then all hands marched back to camp, where they had no sooner arrived and got settled down than the <name>Indians</name> returned to the summit of the ridge, seemingly to enjoy the fire that had been so generously built for their benefit, and with renewed taunts and gestures continued to insult us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The scalp of the <rs>Indian</rs> he had despatched the day before was tied to the cross-bar of his bridle bit, the hair dangling almost to the ground, and <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> was decked out in the sacred vestments <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> of <persName n="Pandoza,Father,,,," id="n0035.0005.00034.00139" reg="mostcommon:Pandoza,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Father">Father</roleName> <surname>Pandoza</surname></persName>, having, long before any <num value="1">one</num> was stirring in camp, ransacked the log-cabin at the <rs>Mission</rs> in which the good man had lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The pigs had not been disturbed by the <name>Indians</name>, but the straggling troops soon disposed of them, and then turned their attention to the cabbages and potatoes in the garden, with the intention, no doubt, of dining that day on fresh pork and fresh vegetables instead of on salt junk and hard bread, which formed their regular diet on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>In digging up the potatoes some <num value="1">one</num> discovered half a keg of powder, which had been buried in the garden by the good father to prevent the hostile <rs>Indians</rs> from getting it to use against the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>We started early the next morning, the snow falling slightly as we set out, and soon arrived at the eastern mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7017545" n="1.000 120" reg="natchez, adams, mississippi">Natchez</placeName> Pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>As we proceeded the storm increased, and the snow-fall became deeper and deeper, until finally our horses could not travel through it. In consequence we were compelled to give up further efforts to advance, and obliged to turn back to the abandoned village, where we encamped for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Near night-fall the storm greatly increased, and our bivouac became most uncomfortable; but spreading my blankets on the snow and covering them with <name>Indian</name> matting, I turned in and slept with that soundness and refreshment accorded by nature to <num value="1">one</num> exhausted by fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>When I awoke in the morning I found myself under about <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> of snow, from which I arose with difficulty, yet grateful that it had kept me warm during the night. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>After a cup of coffee and a little hard bread, it was decided we should return to the main camp near the <rs>Mission</rs>, for we were now confident that <persName n="Maloney,,,,," id="n0035.0005.00036.00146" reg="nearbymention:Maloney,Maurice,,,"><surname>Maloney</surname></persName> was delayed by the snow, and safe enough on the other side of the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>At all events he was beyond aid from us, for the impassable snow-drifts could not be overcome with the means in our possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>It turned out that our suppositions as to the cause of his delay were correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He had met with the same difficulties that confronted us, and had been compelled to go into camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Meanwhile valuable time had been lost, and the <name>Indians</name>, with their families and stock, were well on their way to the <name>Okenagan</name> country, a region into which we could not penetrate in the winter season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>No other course was therefore left but to complete the dismal failure of the expedition by returning home, and our commander readily gave the order to march back to the <name>Dalles</name> by the <quote>short</quote> route over the <rs type="place">Yakima Mountains</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>As the storm was still unabated, it was evident our march home would be a most difficult <num value="1">one</num>, and it was deemed advisable to start back at once, lest we should be blocked up in the mountains by the snows for a period beyond which our provisions would not last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Relying on the fact that the short route to the <name>Dalles</name> would lead us over the range at its most depressed point, where it was hoped the depth of snow was not yet so great as to make the route impassable, we started with <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Nesmith,Colonel,,,," id="n0035.0005.00036.00147" reg="nearbymention:Nesmith,James,W.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Nesmith</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName> in advance to break the road, followed by my dragoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>In the valley we made rapid progress, but when we reached the mountain every step we took up its side showed the snow to be growing deeper and deeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Word was sent to bring <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> him back, but as he had already nearly crossed the plateau, considerable delay occurred before he returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>When he arrived we began anew the work of breaking a road for the foot troops behind us, my detachment now in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The deep snow made our work extremely laborious, exhausting men and horses almost to the point of relinquishing the struggle, but our desperate situation required that we should get down into the valley beyond, or run the chance of perishing on the mountain in a storm which seemed unending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>About midnight the column reached the valley, very tired and hungry, but much elated over its escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>We had spent a day of the most intense anxiety, especially those who had had the responsibility of keeping to the right trail, and been charged with the hard work of breaking the road for the infantry and artillery through such a depth of snow. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Our main difficulties were now over, and in due time we reached the <name>Dalles</name>, where almost everyone connected with the expedition voted it a wretched failure; indeed, <persName n="Rains,General,,,," id="n0035.0005.00037.00151" reg="nearbymention:Rains,Gabriel,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName> himself could not think otherwise, but he scattered far and wide blame for the failure of his combinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>This, of course, led to criminations and recriminations, which eventuated in charges of incompetency preferred against him by <persName n="Ord,Captain,Edward,O.,C.," id="n0035.0005.00037.00152" reg="default:Ord,Edward,O.,C.,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Ord</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3LtArtillery">Third Artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The failure of the <name>Haller</name> expedition from lack of a sufficient force, and of the <name>Rains</name> expedition from the incompetency of its commander, was a great mortification to the officers and men connected with them, and, taken together, had a marked effect upon the <rs>Indian</rs> situation in <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName> and Washington Territories at that particular era.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Acting under these influences, the <name>Spokanes</name>, Walla Wallas, Umatillas, and Nez Perces cast their lot with the hostiles, and all the savage inhabitants of the region east of the <rs>Cascade Range</rs> became involved in a dispute as to whether the <name>Indians</name> or the <rs>Government</rs> should possess certain sections of the country, which finally culminated in the war of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The <placeName key="tgn,2250934" n="1.000 24" reg="columbia river, washington">Columbia River</placeName> was very high at the time, and the water had backed up into the slough about the foot of the <rs>Lower Cascades</rs> to such a degree that it left me only a narrow neck of firm ground to advance over toward the point occupied by the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>On this neck of land the hostiles had taken position, as I soon learned by frequent shots, loud shouting, and much blustering; they, by the most exasperating yells and indecent exhibitions, daring me to the contest. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>After getting well in hand everything connected with my little command, I advanced with <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> men to the edge of a growth of underbrush to make a reconnoissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We stole along under cover of this underbrush until we reached the open ground leading over the causeway or narrow neck before mentioned, when the enemy opened fire and killed a soldier near my side by a shot which, just grazing the bridge of my nose, struck him in the neck, opening an artery and breaking the spinal cord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>He died instantly.

<p>In the evening I sent a report of the situation back to <placeName key="tgn,2117023" n="1.000 3" reg="vancouver, clark, washington territory">Vancouver</placeName> by the steamboat, retaining a large <placeName reg="Hudson, Columbia, New York" key="tgn,7013728">Hudson</placeName>'s Bay bateau which I had brought up with me. Examining this I found it would carry about <num value="20">twenty</num> men, and made up my mind that early next morning I would cross the command to the opposite or south side of the <placeName key="tgn,2250934" n="1.000 24" reg="columbia river, washington">Columbia River</placeName>, and make my way up along the mountain base until I arrived abreast the middle blockhouse, which was still closely besieged, and then at some favorable point recross to the north bank to its relief, endeavoring in this manner to pass around and to the rear of the <name>Indians</name>, whose position confronting me was too strong for a direct attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>This plan was hazardous, but I believed it could be successfully carried out if the boat could be taken with me; but should I not be able to do this I felt that the object contemplated in sending me out would miserably fail, and the small band cooped up at the block-house would soon starve or fall a prey to the <name>Indians</name>, so I concluded to risk all the chances the plan involved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>On the morning of <dateStruct value="-03-28"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="28">28</day></dateStruct> the savages were still in my front, and after giving them some solid shot from <persName n="Dall,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0006.00042.00168" reg="mostcommon:Dall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Dall</surname></persName>'s gun we slipped down to the river-bank, and the detachment crossed by means of the <rs type="place">Hudson's Bay</rs> boat, making a landing on the opposite shore at a point where the south channel of the river, after flowing around <placeName reg="Bradford's Island">Bradford's Island</placeName>, joins the main stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It was then about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, and <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> everything had thus far proceeded favorably, but an examination of the channel showed that it would be impossible to get the boat up the rapids along the mainland, and that success could only be assured by crossing the south channel just below the rapids of the island, along the shore of which there was every probability we could pull the boat through the rocks and swift water until the head of the rapids was reached, from which point to the block-house there was smooth water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Telling the men of the embarrassment in which I found myself, and that if I could get enough of them to man the boat and pull it up the stream by a rope to the shore we would cross to the island and make the attempt, all volunteered to go, but as <num value="10">ten</num> men seemed sufficient I selected that number to accompany me. Before starting, however, I deemed it prudent to find out if possible that was engaging the attention of the <name>Indians</name>, who had not yet discovered that we had left their front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>I therefore climbed up the side of the abrupt mountain which skirted the water's edge until I could see across the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>From this point I observed the <name>Indians</name> running horseraces and otherwise enjoying themselves behind the line they had held against me the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The squaws decked out in gay colors, and the men gaudily dressed in war bonnets, made the scene most attractive, but as everything looked propitious for the dangerous enterprise in hand I spent little time watching them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Quickly returning to the boat, I crossed to the island with my <num value="10">ten</num> men, threw ashore the rope attached to the bow, and commenced the difficult task of pulling her up the rapids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>We got along slowly at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but soon striking a camp of old squaws who had been left on the island for safety, and had not gone over to the mainland to see the races, we utilized them to our advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>With unmistakable threats and signs we made them not only keep quiet, but also give us much needed assistance in pulling vigorously on the towrope of our boat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>I was laboring under a dreadful strain of mental anxiety during all this time, for had the <name>Indians</name> discovered what we were about, they could easily have come over to the island in their canoes, and, by forcing us to take up our arms to repel their attack, doubtless would have obliged the abandonment of the boat, and that essential adjunct to the final success of my plan would have gone down the rapids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Indeed, under such circumstances, it would have been impossible for <num value="10">ten</num> men to hold out against the <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num> <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0006.00043.00169" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Comanche,,,:2"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>; but the island forming an excellent screen to our movements, we were not discovered, and when we reached the smooth water at the upper end of the rapids we quickly crossed over and joined the rest of the men, who in the meantime had worked their way along the south bank of the river parallel with us. I felt very grateful to the old squaws for the assistance they <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> rendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>They worked well under compulsion, and manifested no disposition to strike for higher wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Indeed, I was so much relieved when we had crossed over from the island and joined the rest of the party, that I mentally thanked the squaws <num value="1">one</num> and all. I had much difficulty in keeping the men on the main shore from cheering at our success, but hurriedly taking into the bateau all of them it could carry, I sent the balance along the southern bank, where the railroad is now built, until both detachments arrived at a point opposite the block-house, when, crossing to the north bank, I landed below the block-house some little distance, and returned the boat for the balance of the men, who joined me in a few minutes. </p>

In those days the <rs>Government</rs> did not provide very liberally for sheltering its soldiers; and officers and men were frequently forced to eke out parsimonious appropriations by toilsome work or go without shelter in most inhospitable regions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Of course this post was no exception to the general rule, and as all hands were occupied in its construction, and I the only officer present, I was kept busily employed in supervising matters, both as commandant and quartermaster, until <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, when <persName n="Russell,Captain,D.,A.,," id="n0035.0007.00051.00216" reg="expanded:Russell,David,A.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">Fourth Infantry</orgName>, was ordered to take command, and I was relieved from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part of my duties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>When I relieved <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0035.0007.00051.00219" reg="mostcommon:Hood,John,B.,,:2"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> &mdash; a dragoon officer of their own regiment &mdash; they did not like the change, and I understood that they somewhat contemptuously expressed this in more ways than <num value="1">one</num>, in order to try the temper of the new <quote>Leftenant,</quote> but appreciative and unremitting care, together with firm and just discipline, soon quieted all symptoms of dissatisfaction and overcame all prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The detachment had been made up of details from the different companies of the regiment in order to give <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0035.0007.00051.00220" reg="mostcommon:Williamson,R.,S.,,:1"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName> a mounted force, and as it was usual, under such circumstances, for every company commander to shove into the detail he was called upon to furnish the most troublesome and insubordinate individuals of his company, I had some difficulty, when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> taking command, in controlling such a medley of recalcitrants; but by forethought for them and their wants, and a strict watchfulness for their rights and comfort, I was able in a short time to make them obedient and the detachment cohesive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>In the past year they had made long and tiresome marches, forded swift mountain streams, constructed rafts of logs or bundles of dry reeds to ferry our baggage, swum deep rivers, marched on foot to save their worn-out and exhausted animals, climbed mountains, fought <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0007.00051.00221" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Comanche,,,:2"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, and in all and everything had done the best they could for the service and their commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>The disaffected feeling they entertained when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assumed command soon wore away, and in its place came a confidence and respect which it gives me the greatest pleasure to remember, for small though it was, this was my <orgName type="regiment" key="1CavCommand">first cavalry command</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>They little thought, when we were in the mountains of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> and Oregonnor did I myself then dream &mdash; that but a few years were to elapse before it would be my lot again to command dragoons, this time in numbers so vast as of themselves to compose almost an army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Shortly after the arrival of <persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0007.00051.00222" reg="nearbymention:Russell,D.,A.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> a portion of the <name>Indians</name> at the <rs>Grande Ronde</rs> reservation were taken down the coast to the <name>Siletz</name> reservation, and I was transferred temporarily to <placeName reg="Fort Haskins">Fort Haskins</placeName>, on the <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> latter reserve, and assigned to the duty of completing it and building a blockhouse for the police control of the <name>Indians</name> placed there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>While directing this work, I undertook to make a road across the coast mountains from <placeName reg="Kings Valley, Benton, Oregon" key="tgn,2438517">King's Valley</placeName> to the <name>Siletz</name>, to shorten the haul between the <num value="2">two</num> points by a route I had explored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>I knew there were many obstacles in the way, but the gain would be great if we could overcome them, so I set to work with the enthusiasm of a young pathfinder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>The point at which the road was to cross the range was rough and precipitous, but the <name>Principal</name> difficulty in making it would be from heavy timber on the mountains that had been burned over years and years before, until nothing was left but limbless trunks of dead treesfirs and pines &mdash; that had fallen from time to time until the ground was matted with huge logs from <num value="5">five</num> to <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> in diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>These could not be chopped with axes nor sawed by any ordinary means, therefore we had to burn them into suitable lengths, and drag the sections to either side of the roadway with from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="6">six</num> yoke of oxen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>The work was both tedious and laborious, but in time perseverance surmounted all obstacles and the road was finished, though its grades were very steep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>As soon as it was completed, I wished to demonstrate its value practically, so I started a Government wagon over it loaded with about <measure n="1500l." type="pounds"><num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> pounds</measure> of freight drawn by <num value="6">six</num> yoke of oxen, and escorted by a small detachment of soldiers, When it had gone about <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> the sergeant in charge came back to the post and reported his inability to get any further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Going out to the scene of difficulty I found the wagon at the base of a steep hill, stalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Taking up a whip myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>I directed the men to lay on their gads, for each man had supplied himself with a flexible hickory withe in the early stages of the trip, to start the team, but this course did not move the wagon nor have much effect on the demoralized oxen; but following as a last resort an example I heard of on a former occasion, that brought into use the rough language of the country, I induced the oxen to move with alacrity, and the wagon and contents were speedily carried to the summit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>The whole trouble was at once revealed: the oxen had been broken and trained by a man who, when they were in a pinch, had encouraged them by his frontier vocabulary, and they could not realize what was expected of them under extraordinary conditions until they heard familiar and possibly profanely urgent phrases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>I took the wagon to its destination, but as it was not brought back, even in all the time I was stationed in that country, I think comment on the success of my road is unnecessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>I spent many happy months at <placeName reg="Fort Haskins">Fort Haskins</placeName>, remaining there until the post was nearly completed and its garrison increased by the arrival <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> of <persName n="Dent,Captain,F.,T.,," id="n0035.0007.00053.00223" reg="default:Dent,F.,T.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Dent</surname></persName>--a brother-in-law of <persName n="Grantwith,Captain,Ulysses,S.,," id="n0035.0007.00053.00224" reg="default:Grantwith,Ulysses,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Ulysses</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Grantwith</surname></persName> his company of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">Fourth Infantry</orgName>, in <dateStruct value="1857-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, and while I was still on duty there, the <rs>Coquille Indians</rs> on the <name>Siletz</name>, and down near the <rs type="place">Yaquina Bay</rs>, became, on account of hunger and prospective starvation, very much excited and exasperated, getting beyond the control of their agent, and even threatening his life, so a detachment of troops was sent out to set things to rights, and I took command of it. I took with me most of the company, and arrived at <placeName reg="Yaquina Bay, Lincoln, Oregon" key="tgn,2784397">Yaquina Bay</placeName> in time to succor the agent, who for some days had been besieged in a log hut by the <name>Indians</name> and had almost abandoned hope of rescue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Having brought with me over the mountains a few head of beef cattle for the hungry <rs>Indians</rs>, without thinking of running any great personal risk I had <num value="6">six</num> beeves killed some little distance from my camp, guarding the meat with <num value="4">four</num> soldiers, whom I was obliged to post as sentinels around the small area on which the carcasses lay. The <rs>Indians</rs> soon formed a circle about the sentinels, and impelled by starvation, attempted to take the beef before it could be equally divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>This was of course resisted, when they drew their knives &mdash; their guns having been previously taken away from them &mdash; and some of the inferior chiefs gave the signal to attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>The principal chief, <persName n="John,,Tetootney,,," id="n0035.0007.00053.00225" reg="default:John,Tetootney,,,"><foreName>Tetootney</foreName> <surname>John</surname></persName>, and <num value="2">two</num> other Indians joined me in the centre of the circle, and protesting that they would die rather than that the frenzied onslaught should succeed, harangued the <name>Indians</name> until the rest of the company hastened up from camp and put an end to the disturbance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>I always felt grateful to TetootneyJohn for his loyalty on this occasion, and many times afterward aided his family with a little coffee and sugar, but necessarily surreptitiously, so as not to heighten the prejudices that his friendly act had aroused among his <name>Indian</name> comrades. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>The situation at <placeName reg="Yaquina Bay, Lincoln, Oregon" key="tgn,2784397">Yaquina Bay</placeName> did not seem very safe, notwithstanding the supply of beef we brought; and the possibility that the starving <rs>Indians</rs> might break out was ever present, so to anticipate any further revolt, I called for more troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>The request was complied with by sending to my assistance the greater part of my own company ( <quote>K</quote> ) from <placeName reg="Fort Yamhill">Fort Yamhill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>The men, inspired by the urgency of our situation, marched more than <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> a day, accomplishing the whole distance in so short a period, that I doubt if the record has ever been beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>When this reinforcement arrived, the <name>Indians</name> saw the futility of further demonstrations against their agent, who they seemed to think was responsible for the insufficiency of food, and managed to exist with the slender rations we could spare and such indifferent food as they could pick up, until the <rs>Indian Department</rs> succeeded in getting up its regular supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>In the past the poor things had often been pinched by hunger <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> and neglect, and at times their only food was rock oysters, clams and crabs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Great quantities of these shell-fish could be gathered in the bay near at hand, but the mountain <rs>Indians</rs>, who had heretofore lived on the flesh of mammal, did not take kindly to mollusks, and, indeed, ate the shell-fish only as a last resort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Crab catching at night on the <rs type="place">Yaquina Bay</rs> by the coast <rs>Indians</rs> was a very picturesque scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>It was mostly done by the squaws and children, each equipped with a torch in <num value="1">one</num> hand, and a sharp-pointed stick in the other to take and lift the fish into baskets sung on the back to receive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>I have seen at times hundreds of squaws and children wading about in <placeName reg="Yaquina Bay, Lincoln, Oregon" key="tgn,2784397">Yaquina Bay</placeName> taking crabs in this manner, and the reflection by the water of the light from the many torches, with the movements of the <name>Indians</name> while at work, formed a weird and diverting picture of which we were never tired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>Not long after the arrival of the additional troops from <placeName reg="Fort Yamhill">Yamhill</placeName>, it became apparent that the number of men at <placeName reg="Yaquina Bay, Lincoln, Oregon" key="tgn,2784397">Yaquina Bay</placeName> would have to be reduced, so in view of this necessity, it was deemed advisable to build a block-house for the better protection of the agent, and I looked about for suitable ground on which to erect it. Nearly all around the bay the land rose up from the beach very abruptly, and the only good site that could be found was some level ground used as the burial-place of the <rs type="place">Yaquina Bay</rs> <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0035.0007.00054.00226" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Comanche,,,:2"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>--a small band of fish-eating people who had lived near this point on the coast for ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>They were a robust lot, of tall and well-shaped figures, and were called in the <name>Chinook</name> tongue <quote>salt chuck,</quote> which means fish-eaters, or eaters of food from the salt water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Many of the young men and women were handsome in feature below the forehead, having fine eyes, aquiline noses and good mouths, but, in conformity with a long-standing custom, all had flat heads, which gave them a distorted and hideous appearance, particularly some of the women, who went to the extreme of fashion and flattened the head to the rear in a sharp horizontal ridge by confining it between <num value="2">two</num> boards, <num value="1">one</num> running back from the forehead at an angle of about <num value="40">forty</num> degrees, and the other up perpendicularly from the back of the neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>When a head had been shaped artistically the dusky maiden owner was marked as a belle, and <num value="1">one</num> could become reconciled to it after a time, but when carelessness and neglect had governed in the adjustment of the boards, there probably was nothing in the form of a human being on the face of the earth that appeared so ugly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>It was the mortuary ground of these Indians that occupied the only level spot we could get for the block-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>Their dead were buried in canoes, which rested in the crotches of forked sticks a few feet aboveground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The graveyard was not large, containing probably from <num value="40">forty</num> <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> to <num value="50">fifty</num> canoes in a fair state of preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>According to the custom of all <name>Indian</name> tribes on the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>, when <num value="1">one</num> of their number died all his worldly effects were buried with him, so that the canoes were filled with old clothes, blankets, pieces of calico and the like, intended for the use of the departed in the happy hunting grounds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>I made known to the <name>Indians</name> that we would have to take this piece of ground for the blockhouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>They demurred at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, for there is nothing more painful to an Indian than disturbing his dead, but they finally consented to hold a council next day on the beach, and thus come to some definite conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Next morning they all assembled, and we talked in the <name>Chinook</name> language all day long, until at last they gave in, consenting, probably, as much because they could not help themselves, as for any other reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>It was agreed that on the following day at <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, when the tide was going out, I should take my men and place the canoes in the bay, and let them float out on the tide across the ocean to the happy hunting-grounds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>At that day there existed in <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName> in vast numbers a species of wood-rat, and our inspection of the graveyard showed that the canoes were thickly infested with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>They were a light gray animal, larger than the common gray squirrel, with beautiful bushy tails, which made them strikingly resemble the squirrel, but in cunning and deviltry they were much ahead of that quickwitted rodent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>I have known them to empty in <num value="1">one</num> night a keg of spikes in the storehouse in <placeName reg="Fort Yamhill">Yamhill</placeName>, distributing them along the stringers of the building, with apparently no other purpose than amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>We anticipated great fun watching the efforts of these rats to escape the next day when the canoes should be launched on the ocean, and I therefore forbade any of the command to visit the graveyard in the interim, lest the rats should be alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>I well knew that they would not be disturbed by the <name>Indians</name>, who held the sacred spot in awe. When the work of taking down the canoes and carrying them to the water began, expectation was on tiptoe, but, strange as it may seem, not a rat was to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>This unexpected development was mystifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>They had all disappeared; there was not <num value="1">one</num> in any of the canoes, as investigation proved, for disappointment instigated a most thorough search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> said the rats understood Chinook, and that as they had no wish to accompany the dead across the ocean to the happy hunting-grounds, they took to the woods for safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>However that may be, I have no doubt that the preceding visits to the burialground, and our long talk of the day before, with the unusual stir and bustle, had so alarmed the rats that, impelled by their suspicious instincts, they fled a danger, the nature of which they could not anticipate, but which they felt to be none the less real and impending.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>The troubles at the <rs type="place">Siletz and Yaquina Bay</rs> were settled without further excitement by the arrival in due time of plenty of food, and as the buildings at <placeName reg="Fort Haskins">Fort Haskins</placeName> were so near completion that my services as quartermaster were no longer needed, I was ordered to join my own company at <placeName reg="Fort Yamhill">Fort Yamhill</placeName>, where <persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0008.00057.00227" reg="nearbymention:Russell,D.,A.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> was still in command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>I returned to that place in <dateStruct value="1857-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, and at a period a little later, in consequence of the close of hostilities in <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Oregon</placeName>, the <name>Klamaths</name> and Modocs were sent back to their own country, to that section in which occurred, in <dateStruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></dateStruct>, the disastrous war with the latter tribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>This reduced considerably the number of Indians at the <rs>Grande Ronde</rs>, but as those remaining were still somewhat unruly, from the fact that many questions requiring adjustment were constantly arising between the different bands, the agent and the officers at the post were kept pretty well occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/><persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0008.00057.00228" reg="nearbymention:Russell,D.,A.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> assigned to me the special work of keeping up the police control, and as I had learned at an early day to speak Chinook (the <quote>court language</quote> among the coast tribes) almost as well as the <name>Indians</name> themselves, I was thereby enabled to steer my way successfully on many critical occasions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>For some time the most disturbing and most troublesome element we had was the <placeName reg="Rogue River, Jackson, Oregon" key="tgn,7017727">Rogue River</placeName> band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>For <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> they had fought our troops obstinately, and surrendered at the bitter end in the belief that they were merely overpowered, not conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>They openly boasted to the other <rs>Indians</rs> that they could whip the soldiers, and that they did not wish to follow the white man's ways, continuing consistently <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> their wild habits, unmindful of all admonitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>Indeed, they often destroyed their household utensils, tepees and clothing, and killed their horses on the graves of the dead, in the fulfillment of a superstitious custom, which demanded that they should undergo, while mourning for their kindred, the deepest privation in a property sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Everything the loss of which would make them poor was sacrificed on the graves of their relatives or distinguished warriors, and as melancholy because of removal from their old homes caused frequent deaths, there was no lack of occasion for the sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>The widows and orphans of the dead warriors were of course the chief mourners, and exhibited their grief in many peculiar ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> in particular which was universally practiced by the near kinsfolk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>They would crop their hair very close, and then cover the head with a sort of hood or plaster of black pitch, the composition being clay, pulverized charcoal, and the resinous gum which exudes from the pine-tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>The hood, nearly an inch in thickness, was worn during a period of mourning that lasted through the time it would take nature, by the growth of the hair, actually to lift from the head the heavy covering of pitch after it had become solidified and hard as stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>It must be admitted that they underwent considerable discomfort in memory of their relatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>It took all the influence we could bring to bear to break up these absurdly superstitious practices, and it looked as if no permanent improvement could be effected, for as soon as we got them to discard <num value="1">one</num>, another would be invented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>When not allowed to burn down their tepees or houses, those poor souls who were in a dying condition would be carried out to the neighboring hillsides just before dissolution, and there abandoned to their sufferings, with little or no attention, unless the placing under their heads of a small stick of wood -with possibly some laudable object, but doubtless great discomfort to their victim &mdash; might be considered such. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>To uproot these senseless and monstrous practices was indeed most difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The most pernicious of all was <num value="1">one</num> which was likely to bring about tragic results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>They believed firmly in a class of doctors among their people who professed that they could procure the illness of an individual at will, and that by certain incantations they could kill or cure the sick person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Their faith in this superstition was so steadfast that there was no doubting its sincerity, many indulging at times in the most trying privations, that their relatives might be saved from death at the hands of the doctors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>I often talked with them on the subject, and tried to reason them out of the superstitious belief, defying the doctors to kill me, or even make me ill; but my talks were unavailing, and they always met my arguments with the remark that I was a white <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> man, of a race wholly different from the red man, and that that was the reason the medicine of the doctors would not affect me. These villainous doctors might be either men or women, and any <num value="1">one</num> of them finding an Indian ill, at once averred that his influence was the cause, offering at the same time to cure the invalid for a fee, which generally amounted to about all the ponies his family possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>If the proposition was accepted and the fee paid over, the family, in case the man died, was to have indemnity through the death of the doctor, who freely promised that they might take his life in such event, relying on his chances of getting protection from the furious relatives by fleeing to the military post till time had so assuaged their grief that matters could be compromised or settled by a restoration of a part of the property, when the rascally leeches could again resume their practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Of course the services of a doctor were always accepted when an Indian fell ill; otherwise the invalid's death would surely ensue, brought about by the evil influence that was unpropitiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Latterly it had become quite the thing, when a patient died, for the doctor to flee to our camp &mdash; it was so convenient and so much safer than elsewhere &mdash; and my cellar was a favorite place of refuge from the infuriated friends of the deceased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>Among the most notable of these doctors was an Indian named Sam Patch, who several times sought asylum in my cellar, and being a most profound diplomat, managed on each occasion and with little delay to negotiate a peaceful settlement and go forth in safety to resume the practice of his nefarious profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>I often hoped he would be caught before reaching the post, but he seemed to know intuitively when the time had come to take leg-bail, for his advent at the garrison generally preceded by but a few hours the death of some poor dupe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Finally these peculiar customs brought about the punishment of a noted doctress of the <placeName reg="Rogue River, Jackson, Oregon" key="tgn,7017727">Rogue River</placeName> tribe, a woman who was constantly working in this professional way, and who had found a victim of such prominence among the <rs type="place">Rogue Rivers</rs> that his unlooked for death brought down on her the wrath of all. She had made him so ill, they believed, as to bring him to death's door notwithstanding the many ponies that had been given her to cease the incantations, and it was the conviction of all that she had finally caused the man's death from some ulterior and indiscernible motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>His relatives and friends then immediately set about requiting her with the just penalties of a perfidious breach of contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Their threats induced her instant flight toward my house for the usual protection, but the enraged friends of the dead man gave hot chase, and overtook the witch just inside the limits of the garrison, where, on the parade-ground, in sight of the officers' quarters, <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> and before any <num value="1">one</num> could interfere, they killed her. There were <num value="16">sixteen</num> men in pursuit of the doctress, and <num value="16">sixteen</num> gun-shot wounds were found in her body when examined by the surgeon of the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The killing of the woman was a flagrant and defiant outrage committed in the teeth of the military authority, yet done so quickly that we could not prevent it. This necessitated severe measures, both to allay the prevailing excitement and to preclude the recurrence of such acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>The body was cared for, and delivered to the relatives the next day for burial, after which <persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0008.00060.00229" reg="nearbymention:Russell,D.,A.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> directed me to take such steps as would put a stop to the fanatical usages that had brought about this murderous occurrence, for it was now seen that if timely measures were not taken to repress them, similar tragedies would surely follow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Knowing all the men of the <placeName reg="Rogue River, Jackson, Oregon" key="tgn,7017727">Rogue River</placeName> tribe, and speaking fluently the <name>Chinook</name> tongue, which they all understood, I went down to their village the following day, after having sent word to the tribe that I wished to have a council with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> all met me in council, as I had desired, and I then told them that the men who had taken part in shooting the woman would have to be delivered up for punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>They were very stiff with me at the interview, and with all that talent for circumlocution and diplomacy with which the <rs>Indian</rs> is gifted, endeavored to evade my demands and delay any conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>But I was very positive, would hear of no compromise whatever, and demanded that my terms be at once complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>No <num value="1">one</num> was with me but a sergeant of my company, named <persName n="Miller,,,,," id="n0035.0008.00060.00230" reg="nearbymention:Miller,John,F.,,"><surname>Miller</surname></persName>, who held my horse, and as the chances of an agreement began to grow remote, I became anxious for our safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The conversation waxing hot and the <name>Indians</name> gathering close in around me, I unbuttoned the flap of my pistol holster, to be ready for any emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>When the altercation became most bitter I put my hand to my hip to draw my pistol, but discovered it was gone &mdash; stolen by <num value="1">one</num> of the rascals surrounding me. Finding myself unarmed, I modified my tone and manner to correspond with my helpless condition, thus myself assuming the diplomatic side in the parley, in order to gain time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>As soon as an opportunity offered, and I could, without too much loss of self-respect, and without damaging my reputation among the <name>Indians</name>, I moved out to where the sergeant held my horse, mounted, and crossing the <placeName reg="Yamhill, Yamhill, Oregon" key="tgn,1131991">Yamhill River</placeName> close by, called back in Chinook from the farther bank that <quote>the <num value="16">sixteen</num> men who killed the woman must be delivered up, and my <num value="6">six</num>-shooter also.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>This was responded to by contemptuous laughter, so I went back to the military post somewhat crest-fallen, and made my report of the turn affairs had taken, inwardly longing for another chance to bring the rascally <rs>Rogue Rivers</rs> to terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/><pb id="p.61" n="61"/> </p> 
<p>When I had explained the situation to <persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0008.00061.00231" reg="nearbymention:Russell,D.,A.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, he thought that we could not, under any circumstances, overlook this defiant conduct of the <name>Indians</name>, since, unless summarily punished, it would lead to even more serious trouble in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>I heartily seconded this proposition, and gladly embracing the opportunity it offered, suggested that if he would give me another chance, and let me have the effective force of the garrison, consisting of about <num value="50">fifty</num> men, I would chastise the <rs type="place">Rogue Rivers</rs> without fail, and that the next day was all the time I required to complete arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>He gave me the necessary authority, and I at once set to work to bring about a better state of discipline on the reservation, and to put an end to the practices of the medicine men (having also in view the recovery of my <num value="6">six</num>-shooter and self-respect), by marching to the village and taking the rebellious <rs>Indians</rs> by force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>In the tribe there was an excellent woman called <persName n="Mary,,Tighee,,," id="n0035.0008.00061.00232" reg="default:Mary,Tighee,,,"><foreName>Tighee</foreName> <surname>Mary</surname></persName> (Tighee in Chinook means chief), who by right of inheritance was a kind of queen of the <rs type="place">Rogue Rivers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Fearing that the insubordinate conduct of the <name>Indians</name> would precipitate further trouble, she came early the following morning to see me and tell me of the situation, <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> informed me that she had done all in her power to bring the <name>Indians</name> to reason, but without avail, and that they were determined to fight rather than deliver up the <num value="16">sixteen</num> men who had engaged in the shooting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>She also apprised me of the fact that they had taken up a position on the <placeName reg="Yamhill, Yamhill, Oregon" key="tgn,1131991">Yamhill River</placeName>, on the direct road between the post and village, where, painted and armed for war, they were awaiting attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>On this information I concluded it would be best to march to the village by a circuitous route instead of directly, as at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intended, so I had the ferryboat belonging to the post floated about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> down the <placeName reg="Yamhill, Yamhill, Oregon" key="tgn,1131991">Yamhill River</placeName> and there anchored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>At <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> that night I marched my <num value="50">fifty</num> men out of the garrison, in a direction opposite to that of the point held by the <name>Indians</name>, and soon reached the river at the ferryboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Here I ferried the party over with little delay, and marched them along the side of the mountain, through underbrush and fallen timber, until, just before daylight, I found that we were immediately in rear of the village, and hence in rear, also, of the line occupied by the refractory <rs>Indians</rs>, who were expecting to meet me on the direct road from the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Just at break of day we made a sudden descent upon the village and took its occupants completely by surprise, even capturing the chief of the tribe, <quote><persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>,</quote> who was dressed in all his war toggery, fully armed and equipped, in anticipation of a fight on the road where his comrades were in position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>I at once put <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> under guard, giving orders to kill him instantly if the <name>Indians</name> fired a shot; then forming my line on the road beyond the edge of the village, in rear of the force <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> lying in wait for a front attack, we moved forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>When the hostile party realized that they were completely cut off from the village, they came out from .their stronghold on the river and took up a line in my front, distant about <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure> with the apparent intention of resisting to the last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>As is usual with Indians when expecting a fight, they were nearly naked, fantastically painted with blue clay, and hideously arrayed in was bonnets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>They seemed very belligerent, brandishing their muskets in the air, dancing on <num value="1">one</num> foot, calling us ugly names, and making such other demonstrations of hostility, that it seemed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that nothing short of the total destruction of the party could bring about the definite settlement that we were bent on. Still, as it was my desire to bring them under subjection without loss of life, if possible, I determined to see what result would follow when they learned that their chief was at our mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>So, sending <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> under guard to the front, where we could be seen, informing them that he would be immediately shot if they fired upon us, and aided by the cries and lamentations of the women of the village, who deprecated any hostile action by either party, I soon procured a parley. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The insubordinate <rs>Indians</rs> were under command of <quote><persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName>,</quote> <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>'s brother, who at last sent me word that he wanted to see me, and we met between our respective lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>I talked kindly to him, but was firm in my demand that the men who killed the woman must be given up and my <num value="6">six</num>-shooter returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>His reply was he did not think it could be done, but he would consult his people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>After the consultation, he returned and notified me that <num value="15">fifteen</num> would surrender and the sixshooter would be restored, and further, that we could kill the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> man, since the tribe wished to get rid of him anyhow, adding that he was a bad <name>Indian</name>, whose bullet no doubt had given the woman her death wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>He said that if I assented to this arrangement, he would require all of his people except the objectionable man to run to the right of his line at a preconcerted signal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The bad <rs>Indian</rs> would be ordered to stand fast on the extreme left, and we could open fire on him as his comrades fell away to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>I agreed to the proposition, and gave <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName> <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> to execute his part of it. We then returned to our respective forces, and a few minutes later the <num value="15">fifteen</num> ran to the right flank as agreed upon, and we opened fire on the <num value="1">one</num> Indian left standing alone, bringing him down in his tracks severely wounded by a shot through the shoulder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>While all this was going on, the other bands of the reservation, several <num value="1000">thousand</num> strong, had occupied the surrounding hills for the purpose of witnessing the fight, for as the <rs type="place">Rogue Rivers</rs> had been bragging <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> <figure id="fig.063"> 
<head><persName n="Torbert,General,A.,T.,A.," id="n0035.0008.00063.00233" reg="expanded:Torbert,Alfred,T.,A.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Torbert</surname></persName>.</head></figure> <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> for some time that they could whip the soldiers, these other Indians had come out to see it done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The result, however, disappointed the spectators, and the <rs type="place">Rogue Rivers</rs> naturally lost caste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The <num value="15">fifteen</num> men now came in and laid down their arms (including my <num value="6">six</num>-shooter) in front of us as agreed, but I compelled them to take the surrendered guns up again and carry them to the post, where they were deposited in the block-house for future security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>The prisoners were ironed with ball and chain, and made to work at the post until their rebellious spirit was broken; and the wounded man was correspondingly punished after he had fully recovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>An investigation as to why this man had been selected as the offering by which <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName> and his companions expected to gain immunity, showed that the fellow was really a most worthless character, whose death even would have been a benefit to the tribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Thus it seemed that they had <num value="2">two</num> purposes in view &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> to propitiate me and get good terms, the other to rid themselves of a vagabond member of the tribe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>The punishment of these <num value="16">sixteen</num> Indians by ball and chain ended all trouble with the <placeName reg="Rogue River, Jackson, Oregon" key="tgn,7017727">Rogue River</placeName> tribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>The disturbances arising from the incantations of the doctors and doctresses, and the practice of killing horses and burning all worldly property on the graves of those who died, were completely suppressed, and we made with little effort a great stride toward the civilization of these crude and superstitious people, for they now began to recognize the power of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The duty was not distasteful, and I felt that I was qualified to undertake it, for the accounts to be audited belonged exclusively to the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Subsistence departments, and by recent experience I had become familiar with the class of papers that pertained to those branches of the army.

Yet, having at command a very skillful corps of millwrights, machinists, and millers, detailed principally from the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW4">Fourth Iowa</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="36ILVolunteer">Thirty-sixth Illinois volunteer regiments</orgName>, we soon got matters in shape, and were able to send such large quantities of flour and meal to the front, that only the bacon and small parts of the ration had to be brought forward from our depot at <placeName key="tgn,2060292" n="1.000 108" reg="rolla, phelps, missouri">Rolla</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>When things were well systematized, I went forward myself to expedite the delivery of supplies, and joined the army at <placeName key="tgn,2268763" n="1.000 8" reg="cross hollows, benton, arkansas">Cross Hollows</placeName>, just south of <placeName reg="Pea Ridge, Benton, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009193">Pea Ridge</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The success of the <rs>Union</rs> troops in this battle was considerable, and while not of sufficient magnitude to affect the general cause materially, it was decisive as to that particular campaign, and resulted in driving all organized <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> out of the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">State of Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>After <placeName reg="Pea Ridge, Benton, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009193">Pea Ridge</placeName> was won, certain efforts were made to deprive <persName n="Curtis,,,,," id="n0035.0009.00072.00261" reg="nearbymention:Curtis,Samuel,R.,,"><surname>Curtis</surname></persName> of the credit due him for the victory; but, no matter what merit belonged to individual commanders, I was always convinced that <persName n="Curtis,,,,," id="n0035.0009.00072.00262" reg="nearbymention:Curtis,Samuel,R.,,"><surname>Curtis</surname></persName> was deserving of the highest commendation, not only for the skill displayed on the field, but for a zeal and daring in campaign which was not often exhibited at that early period of the war. Especially should this credit be awarded him, when we consider the difficulties under which he labored, how he was hampered in having to depend on a sparsely settled country for the subsistence of his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>In the reports of the battle that came to <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, much glory was claimed for some other general officers, but as I had control of the telegraph line from <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName> east, I detained all despatches until <persName n="Curtis,General,,,," id="n0035.0009.00072.00263" reg="nearbymention:Curtis,Samuel,R.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Curtis</surname></persName> had sent in his official report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>He coveted my place, and finally succeeded in getting it. He had been an unsuccessful banker in <placeName reg="Iowa, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName>, and early in the war obtained an appointment as assistant quartermaster of volunteers with the rank of captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>As <rs type="role" reg="chief-Quartermaster">chief quartermaster</rs> of the army in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, there would be opportunities for the recuperation of his fortunes which would not offer to <num value="1">one</num> in a subordinate place; so to gain this position he doubtless intrigued for it while under my eye, and <persName n="Curtis,,,,," id="n0035.0009.00072.00265" reg="nearbymention:Curtis,Samuel,R.,,"><surname>Curtis</surname></persName> was induced to give it to him as soon as I was relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>His career as my successor, as well as in other capacities in which he was permitted to act during the war, was to say the least not savory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>I had in my possession at all times large sums of money for the needs <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> of the army, and among other purposes for which these funds were to be disbursed was the purchase of horses and mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Certain officers and men more devoted to gain than to the performance of duty (a few such are always to be found in armies) quickly learned this, and determined to profit by it. Consequently they began a regular system of stealing horses from the people of the country and proffering them to me for purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>It took but a little time to discover this roguery, and when I became satisfied of their knavery I brought it to a sudden close by seizing the horses as captured property, branding them <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The immediate result of this disobedience was a courtmartial to try me; and knowing that my usefulness in that army was gone, no matter what the outcome of the trial might be, I asked <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n0035.0009.00073.00267" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> to relieve me from duty with <persName n="Curtis,General,,,," id="n0035.0009.00073.00268" reg="nearbymention:Curtis,Samuel,R.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Curtis</surname></persName> and order me to <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>It was to start on the night of the <dateStruct value="-05-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> at <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, and proceed by a circuitous route through <placeName reg="Iuka, Tishomingo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056685">Iuka, Miss.</placeName>, to <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName>, a station on the <orgName n="Mobile and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Mobile and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, about <placeName><distance reg="22miles">twenty-two miles</distance> below <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName></placeName>, and accomplish all it could in the way of destroying the enemy's supplies and cutting his railroad communications. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>The weather in that climate was already warm, guides unobtainable, and both men and horses suffered much discomfort from the heat, and fatigue from the many delays growing out of the fact that we were in almost total ignorance of the roads leading to the point that we desired to reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>In order that we might go light we carried only sugar, coffee, and salt, depending on the country for meat and bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Both these articles were scarce, but I think we got all there was, for our advent was so unexpected by the people of the region through which we passed that, supposing us to be <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName>, they often gave us all they had, the women and servants contributing most freely from their reserve stores. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Before reaching <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName> I had the advance, but just as we arrived on the outskirts of the town the brigade was formed with the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW2">Second Iowa</orgName> on my right, and the whole force moved forward, right in front, preceded by skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Here we encountered the enemy, but forced him back with little resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>When we had gained possession of the station, <persName n="Elliott,Colonel,,,," id="n0035.0010.00079.00313" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,Washington,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Elliott</surname></persName> directed <num value="1">one</num> to take the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of my <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> regiment, pass to the south, and destroy a bridge or culvert supposed to be at a little distance below the town on the <orgName n="Mobile and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Mobile and Ohio Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>The <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>, or other half of the regiment, was to be held in reserve for my support if necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>I moved rapidly in the designated direction till I reached the railroad, and then rode down it for a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, but found neither bridge nor culvert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>I then learned that there was no bridge of any importance except the <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName reg="Baldwin, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,2018514">Baldwin</placeName>, <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure> farther down, but as I was aware, from information recently received, that it was defended by <num value="3">three</num> regiments and a battery, I concluded that I could best accomplish the purpose for which I had been detached &mdash; crippling the road &mdash; by tearing up the track, bending the rails, and burning the cross-ties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>This was begun with alacrity at <num value="4">four</num> different points, officers and men vieing with <num value="1">one</num> another in the laborious work of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>We had but few tools, and as the difficulties to overcome were serious, our progress was slow, until some genius conceived the idea that the track, rails and ties, might be lifted from its bed bodily, turned over, and subjected to a high heat; a convenient supply of dry fence-rails would furnish ample fuel to render the rails useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>In this way a good deal of the track was effectively broken up, and communication by rail from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> to the south entirely cut off. While we were still busy in wrecking the road, a dash was made at my right and rear by a squadron of <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>This was handsomely met by the reserve under <persName n="Campbell,Captain,Archibald,P.,," id="n0035.0010.00080.00314" reg="default:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Archibald</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MI2">Second Michigan</orgName>, who, dismounting a portion of his command, received the enemy with such a volley from his <persName n="Colt,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00080.00315" reg="mostcommon:Colt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colt</surname></persName>'s repeating rifles that the squadron broke and fled in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>We were not molested further, and resumed our work, intending to extend the break toward <placeName reg="Baldwin, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,2018514">Baldwin</placeName>, but receiving orders from <persName n="Elliott,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00080.00316" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,Washington,L.,,"><surname>Elliott</surname></persName> to return to <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName> immediately, the men were recalled, and we started to rejoin the main command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>In returning to <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName>, I found the railroad track above where I had struck it blocked by trains that we had thus cut off, and the woods and fields around the town covered with several <num value="1000">thousand</num> Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>These were mostly convalescents and disheartened stragglers belonging to <orgName n="army"><persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0035.0010.00080.00317" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, and from them we learned that <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> was being evacuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>I spent some little time in an endeavor to get these demoralized men into an open field, with a view to some future disposition of them; but in the midst of the undertaking I received another order from <persName n="Elliott,Colonel,,,," id="n0035.0010.00080.00318" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,Washington,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Elliott</surname></persName> to join him at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Under such circumstances my prisoners would prove a decided embarrassment, so I abandoned further attempts to get them together &mdash; not even paroling them, which I thought might have been done with but little risk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>In the meantime the captured cars had been fired, and as their complete destruction was assured by explosions from those containing ammunition, they needed no further attention, so I withdrew my men and hastened to join <persName n="Elliott,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00082.00320" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,Washington,L.,,"><surname>Elliott</surname></persName>, taking along some Confederate officers whom I had retained from among <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500" type="prisoners">five hundred prisoners</measure> captured when making the original dash below the town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>The losses in my regiment, and, in fact, those of the entire command, were insignificant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>The results of the expedition were important; the railroad being broken so thoroughly as to cut off all rolling stock north of <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName>, and to place at the service of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n0035.0010.00082.00321" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> the cars and locomotives of which the retreating Confederates were now so much in need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>In addition, we burned <num value="26">twenty-six</num> cars containing <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> stand of small arms, <num value="3">three</num> pieces of artillery, a great quantity of clothing, a heavy supply of ammunition, and the personal baggage of <persName n="Polk,General,Leonidas,,," id="n0035.0010.00082.00322" reg="default:Polk,Leonidas,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Leonidas</foreName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>A large number of prisoners, mostly sick and convalescent, also fell into our hands; but as we could not carry them with us &mdash; such a hurried departure was an immediate necessity, by reason of our critical situation &mdash; the process of paroling them was not contempleted, and they doubtless passed back to active service in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, properly enough unrecognized as prisoners of war by their superiors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>In returning, the columns marched back by another indirect route to its old camp near <placeName reg="Farmington, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056417">Farmington</placeName>, where we learned that the whole army had moved into and beyond <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, in pursuit of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00082.00323" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, on the <dateStruct value="-05-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, the very day we had captured <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Although we had marched about <measure n="180miles" type="distance">one hundred and eighty miles</measure> in <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, we were required to take part, of course, in the pursuit of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>So, resting but <num value="1">one</num> night in our old camp, we were early in the saddle again on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-06-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Marching south through <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, we passed on the <dateStruct value="-06-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> the scene of our late raid, viewing with much satisfaction, as we took the road toward <placeName key="tgn,2055978" n="1.000 7" reg="blackland, prentiss, mississippi">Blackland</placeName>, the still smoldering embers of the burned trains. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Pushing the <rs>Confederate</rs> scours rapidly in with a running fire for a mile or more, while we were approaching <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> a little stream, I hoped to gobble the main body of the enemy's pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>I therefore directed the sabre battalion of the regiments, followed by that portion of it armed with revolving rifles, to dash forward in column, cut off these videttes before they could cross the stream, and then gather them in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>We withdrew without loss under cover of thick woods, aided much, however, by the consternation of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, who had hardly recovered from their surprise at our sudden appearance in their camp before we had again placed the stream between them and us by recrossing the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The reconnaissance was a success in <num value="1">one</num> way &mdash; that is, in finding out that the enemy was at the point supposed by <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0035.0010.00083.00328" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>; but it also had a tendency to accelerate <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00083.00329" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s retreat, for in a day or <num value="2">two</num> his whole line fell back as far south as <placeName key="tgn,2056562" n="1.000 35" reg="guntown, lee, mississippi">Guntown</placeName>, thus rendering abortive the plans for bagging a large portion of his army. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>The number of these was quite large, and indicated that the enemy was considerably demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>Under such circumstances, an energetic and skillfully directed pursuit might not have made certain the enemy's destruction, but it would largely have aided in disintegrating his forces, and I never could quite understand why it was not ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>The desultory affairs between rear and advance guards seemed as a general thing to have no particular purpose in view beyond finding out where the enemy was, and when he was found, since no supporting columns were at hand and no <num value="1">one</num> in supreme control was present to give directions, our skirmishing was of little avail and brought but small reward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>A short time subsequent to these occurrences, <persName n="Elliott,Colonel,,,," id="n0035.0010.00083.00332" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,Washington,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Elliott</surname></persName> was made a brigadier-general, and as <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0035.0010.00083.00333" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> appointed him his ChiefofStaff, I, on the <dateStruct value="1862-06-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> fell in command of the brigade by seniority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>For the rest of the month but little of moment occurred, <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> and we settled down into camp at <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-06-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, in a position which my brigade had been ordered to take up some <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> in advance of the main army for the purpose of covering its front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Although but a few days had elapsed from the date of my appointment as colonel of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MI2">Second Michigan</orgName> to that of my succeeding to the command of the brigade, I believe I can say with propriety that I had firmly established myself in the confidence of the officers and men of the regiment, and won their regard by thoughtful care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>I had striven unceasingly to have them well fed and well clothed, had personally looked after the selection of their camps, and had maintained such a discipline as to allay former irritation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Men who march, scout, and fight, and suffer all the hardships that fall to the lot of soldiers in the field, in order to do vigorous work must have the best bodily sustenance, and every comfort that can be provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>I knew from practical experience on the frontier that my efforts in this direction would not only be appreciated, but requited by personal affection and gratitude; and, further, that such exertions would bring the best results to me. Whenever my authority would permit I saved my command from needless sacrifices and unnecessary toil; therefore, when hard or daring work was to be done I expected the heartiest response, and always got it. Soldiers are averse to seeing their comrades killed without compensating results, and none realize more quickly than they the blundering that often takes place on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>They want some tangible indemnity for the loss of life, and as victory is an offset the value of which is manifest, it not only makes them content to shed their blood, but also furnishes evidence of capacity in those who command them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>My regiment had lost very few men since coming under my command, but it seemed, in the eyes of all who belonged to it, that casualties to the enemy and some slight successes for us had repaid every sacrifice, and in consequence I had gained not only their confidence as soldiers, but also their esteem and love as men, and to a degree far beyond what I then realized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>As soon as the camp of my brigade was pitched at <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName>, I began to scout in every direction, to obtain a knowledge of the enemy's whereabouts and learn the ground about me. My standing in drawing at the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName> had never been so high as to warrant the belief that I could ever prove myself an expert, but a few practical lessons in that line were impressed on me there, and I had retained enough to enable me to make rough maps that could be readily understood, and which would be suitable to replace the erroneous skeleton outlines of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, with which at this time we were scantily furnished; so as soon as possible I compiled for the use of myself and my regimental <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> commanders an information map of the surrounding country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>This map exhibited such details as country roads, streams, farmhouses, fields, woods, and swamps, and such other topographical features as would be useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>I must confess that my crude sketch did not evidence much artistic merit, but it was an improvement on what we already possessed in the way of details to guide the command, and this was what I most needed; for it was of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance that in our exposed condition we should be equipped with a thorough knowledge of the section in which we were operating, so as to be prepared to encounter an enemy already indicating recovery from the disorganizing effects of his recent retreat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>In the immediate vicinity of <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName> the country was covered with heavy forests, with here and there clearings or intervening fields that had been devoted to the cultivation of cotton and corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>The ground was of a low character, typical of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">northeastern</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, and abounded in small creeks that went almost totally dry even in short periods of drought, but became flooded with muddy water under the outpouring of rain peculiar to a semi-tropical climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>In such a region there were many chances of our being surprised, especially by an enemy who knew the country well, and whose ranks were filled with local guides; and great precautions as well as the fullest information were necessary to prevent disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>I therefore endeavored to familiarize all with our surroundings, but scarcely had matters begun to shape themselves as I desired when our annihilation was attempted by a large force of <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>At this junction there was a strong position in the protecting timber, and here <persName n="Scranton,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00085.00336" reg="nearbymention:Scranton,Leonidas,S.,,"><surname>Scranton</surname></persName> made a firm stand, being reinforced presently by the few men he had out as pickets on the road to his left, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <orgName type="company" n="Company I">company I</orgName> had sent him from camp, and subsequently by <num value="3">three</num> companies more, all now commanded by <persName n="Campbell,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0010.00085.00337" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>This force was dismounted and formed in line, and soon developed that the enemy was present in large numbers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>Full information of the situation was immediately sent me, and I directed <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00086.00339" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName> to hold fast, if possible, till I could support him, but if compelled to retire he was authorized to do so slowly, taking advantage of every means that fell in his way to prolong the fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Before this I had stationed <num value="1">one</num> battalion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW2">Second Iowa</orgName> in <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName>, but <persName n="Hatch,Colonel,Edward,,," id="n0035.0010.00086.00340" reg="default:Hatch,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Hatch</surname></persName>, commanding that regiment, was now directed to leave <num value="1">one</num> company for the protection of our camp a little to the north of the station, and take the balance of the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW2">Second Iowa</orgName>, with the battalion in <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName> except <num value="2">two</num> sabre companies, and form the whole in rear of <persName n="Campbell,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0010.00086.00341" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, to protect his flanks and support him by a charge should the enemy break his dismounted line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>While these preparations were being made, the <rs>Confederates</rs> attempted to drive <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00086.00342" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName> from his position by a direct attack through an open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>In this they failed, however, for our men, reserving their fire until the enemy came within about <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure>, then opened on him with such a shower of bullets from our <orgName n="rifles"><persName n="Colt,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00086.00343" reg="mostcommon:Colt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colt</surname></persName>'s rifles</orgName> that it soon became too hot for him, and he was repulsed with considerable loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Foiled in this move, <persName n="Chalmers,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00086.00344" reg="nearbymention:Chalmers,James,R.,,"><surname>Chalmers</surname></persName> hesitated to attack again in front, but <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> began overlapping both flanks of <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00087.00345" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName>'s line by force of numbers, compelling <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00087.00346" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName> to retire toward a strong position I had selected in his rear for a line on which to make our main resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>As soon as the enemy saw this withdrawing he again charged in front, but was again as gallantly repelled as in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assault, although the encounter was for a short time so desperate as to have the character of a handto-hand conflict, several groups of friend and foe using on each other the butts of their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>At this juncture the timely arrival of <persName n="Hatch,Colonel,,,," id="n0035.0010.00087.00347" reg="nearbymention:Hatch,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hatch</surname></persName> with the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW2">Second Iowa</orgName> gave a breathing-spell to <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00087.00348" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, and made the <rs>Confederates</rs> so chary of further direct attacks that he was enabled to retire; and at the same time I found opportunity to make disposition of the reinforcement to the best advantage possible, placing the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW2">Second Iowa</orgName> on the left of the new line and strengthening <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00087.00349" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Archibald,P.,,"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName> on its right with all the men available. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>In view of his numbers, the enemy soon regained confidence in his ability to overcome us, and in a little while again began his flanking movements, his right passing around my left flank some distance, and approaching our camp and transportation, which I had forbidden to be moved out to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Fearing that he would envelop us and capture the camp and transportation, I determined to take the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Remembering a circuitous wood road that I had become familiar with while making the map heretofore mentioned, I concluded that the most effective plan would be to pass a small column around the enemy's left, by way of this road, and strike his rear by a mounted charge simultaneously with an advance of our main line on his front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>I knew that the attack in rear would be a most hazardous undertaking, but in the face of such odds as the enemy had the condition of affairs was most critical, and could be relieved only by a bold and radical change in our tactics; so I at once selected <num value="4">four</num> sabre companies, <num value="2">two</num> from the <orgName type="regiment" key="MI2">Second Michigan</orgName> and <num value="2">two</num> from the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW2">Second Iowa</orgName>, and placing <persName n="Alger,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0010.00087.00350" reg="mostcommon:Alger,Russell,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Alger</surname></persName>, of the former regiment, in command of them, I informed him that I expected of them the quick and desperate work that is usually imposed on a forlorn hope. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>To carry out the purpose now in view, I instructed <persName n="Alger,Captain,,,," id="n0035.0010.00087.00351" reg="mostcommon:Alger,Russell,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Alger</surname></persName> to follow the wood road as it led around the left of the enemy's advancing forces, to a point where it joined the <placeName key="tgn,2055978" n="1.000 7" reg="blackland, prentiss, mississippi">Blackland</placeName> road, about <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName></placeName>, and directed him, upon reaching the <placeName key="tgn,2055978" n="1.000 7" reg="blackland, prentiss, mississippi">Blackland</placeName> road, to turn up it immediately, and charge the rear of the enemy's line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Under no circumstances was he to deploy the battalion, but charge <hi rend="italics">in column</hi> right through whatever he came upon, and report to me in front of <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName>, if at all possible for him to get there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>If he failed to break through the enemy's line, he was to go ahead as far as he <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> could, and then if any of his men were left, and he was able to retreat, he was to do so by the same route he had taken on his way out. To conduct him on this perilous service I sent along a thin, sallow, tawnyhaired Mississippian named Beene, whom I had employed as a guide and scout a few days before, on account of his intimate knowledge of the roads, from the public thoroughfares down to the insignificant bypaths of the neighboring swamps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>With such guidance I felt sure that the column would get to the desired point without delay, for there was no danger of its being lost or misled by taking any of the many by-roads which traversed the dense forests through which it would be obliged to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>I also informed <persName n="Alger,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00088.00352" reg="mostcommon:Alger,Russell,A.,,:1"><surname>Alger</surname></persName> that I should take the reserve and join the main line in front of <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName> for the purpose of making an advance of my whole force, and that as a signal he must have his men cheer loudly when he struck the enemy's rear, in order that my attack might be simultaneous with his. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>I gave him <num value="1">one</num> hour to go around and come back through the enemy, and when he started I moved to the front with the balance of the reserve, to put everything I had into the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>This meant an inestimable advantage to the enemy in case of our defeat, but our own safety demanded the hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>All along our attenuated line the fighting was now sharp, and the enemy's firing indicated such numerical strength that fear of disaster to <persName n="Alger,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00088.00353" reg="mostcommon:Alger,Russell,A.,,:1"><surname>Alger</surname></persName> increased my anxiety terribly as the time set for his cheering arrived and no sound of it was heard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Relying, however, on the fact that Beene's knowledge of the roads would prevent his being led astray, and confident of <persName n="Alger,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00088.00354" reg="mostcommon:Alger,Russell,A.,,:1"><surname>Alger</surname></persName>'s determination to accomplish the purpose for which he set out, as soon as the hour was up I ordered my whole line forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Fortunately, just as this moment a locomotive and <num value="2">two</num> cars loaded with grain for my horses ran into <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>I say fortunately, because it was well known throughout the command that in the morning, when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered the large numbers of the enemy, I had called for assistance; and my troops, now thinking that reinforcements had arrived by rail from <placeName key="tgn,2057358" n="1.000 20" reg="rienzi, alcorn, mississippi">Rienzi</placeName>, where a division of infantry was encamped, and inspirated by this belief, advanced with renewed confidence and wild cheering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Meantime I had the engineer of the locomotive blow his whistle loudly, so that the enemy might also learn that a train had come; and from the fact that in a few moments he began to give way before our small force, I thought that this strategem had some effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Soon his men broke, and ran in the utmost disorder over the country in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>I found later, however, that his precipitous retreat was due to the pressure on his left from the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW2">Second Iowa</orgName>, in concert with the front attack of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MI2">Second Michigan</orgName>, and the demoralization wrought in his <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> rear by <persName n="Alger,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00089.00355" reg="mostcommon:Alger,Russell,A.,,:1"><surname>Alger</surname></persName>, who had almost entirely accomplished the purpose of his expedition, though he had failed to come through, or so near that I could hear the signal agreed upon before leaving <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>After <persName n="Alger,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00089.00356" reg="mostcommon:Alger,Russell,A.,,:1"><surname>Alger</surname></persName> had reached and turned up the <placeName key="tgn,2055978" n="1.000 7" reg="blackland, prentiss, mississippi">Blackland</placeName> road, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing he came across was the <rs>Confederate</rs> headquarters; the officers and orderlies about which he captured and sent back some distance to a farm-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>Continuing on a gallop, he soon struck the rear of the enemy's line, but was unable to get through; nor did he get near enough for me to hear his cheering; but as he had made the distance he was to travel in the time allotted, his attack and mine were almost coincident, and the enemy, stampeded by the charges in front and rear, fled toward <placeName key="tgn,2055978" n="1.000 7" reg="blackland, prentiss, mississippi">Blackland</placeName>, with little or no attempt to capture <orgName n="command"><persName n="Alger,,,,," id="n0035.0010.00089.00357" reg="mostcommon:Alger,Russell,A.,,:1"><surname>Alger</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, which might readily have been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>They had sustained little loss except a few men wounded and a few temporarily missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>The missing had been dismounted in <num value="1">one</num> way or another, and run over by the enemy in his flight; but they all turned up later, none the worse except for a few scratches and bruises. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Ill-judged meddling in this respect often led to differences between us, only temporary it is true, but most harassing to the subordinate, since I was compelled by the circumstances of the situation not only invariably to yield my own judgment, but many a time had to play peacemaker-smoothing down ruffled feelings, that I knew had been excited by <persName n="Granger,,,,," id="n0035.0011.00092.00390" reg="nearbymention:Granger,G.,,,"><surname>Granger</surname></persName>'s freaky and spasmodic efforts to correct personally some trifling fault that ought to have been left to a regimental or company commander to remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>To do the work required, necessitated an increase of my command, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="7KACav">Seventh Kansas Cavalry</orgName> was therefore added to it, and my picket-line extended so as to cover from <placeName key="tgn,2056686" n="1.000 15" reg="jacinto, alcorn, mississippi">Jacinto</placeName> southwesterly to a point midway between <placeName key="tgn,2057358" n="1.000 20" reg="rienzi, alcorn, mississippi">Rienzi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Booneville, Prentiss, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056008">Booneville</placeName>, and then northwesterly to the <placeName key="tgn,7020819" n="1.000 58" reg="hatchie river, united states">Hatchie River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>This decisive evidence was of the utmost importance, and without taking time to read all the letters, I forwarded them to <persName n="Granger,General,,,," id="n0035.0011.00093.00400" reg="nearbymention:Granger,G.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Granger</surname></persName> <dateStruct value="-07-28"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="28">28</day></dateStruct>, in a despatch which stated: <quote>I deem it necessary to send them at once; the enemy is moving in large force on <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>The prevalence of a severe drought had resulted in drying up many of the streams within the enemy's lines, and, in consequence, he was obliged to shift his camps often, and send his beef-cattle and mules near his outposts for water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>My scouts kept me well posted in regard to the movements of both camps and herds; and a favorable opportunity presenting itself, I sent an expedition on <dateStruct value="-08-14"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="14">14</day></dateStruct> to gather in some animals located on <placeName reg="Twentymile Creek, Mississippi, United States" key="tgn,2735096">Twenty-Mile Creek</placeName>, a stream always supplied with water <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> from a source of never-failing springs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Our side met with complete success in this instance, and when the expedition returned, we were all made happy by an abundance of fresh beef, and by some <measure n="200" type="captured">two hundred captured</measure> mules, that we thus added to our trains at a time when draft animals were much needed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Rations for the men were now supplied in fair quantities, and the only thing required to make us wholly contented was plenty of grain for our animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Because of the large number of troops then in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">West</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and about <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, the indifferent railroad leading down from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus, Ky.</placeName>, was taxed to its utmost capacity to transport supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>I had hopes, however, that this condition of things might be ameliorated before long by gathering a good supply of corn that was ripening in the neighborhood, and would soon, I thought, be sufficiently hard to feed to my animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>Not far from my headquarters there was a particularly fine field, which, with this end in view, I had carefully protected through the milky stage, to the evident disappointment of both <persName n="Asboth,,,,," id="n0035.0011.00094.00402" reg="nearbymention:Asboth,A.,,,"><surname>Asboth</surname></persName>'s men and mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>They bore the prohibition well while it affected only themselves, but the trial was too great when it came to denying their horses; and men whose discipline kept faith with my guards during the roasting-ear period now fell from grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>Their horses were growing thin, and few could withstand the mute appeals of their suffering pets; so at night the corn, because of individual foraging, kept stealthily and steadily vanishing, until the field was soon fringed with only earless stalks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>The disappearance was noticed, and the guard increased, but still the quantity of corn continued to grow less, the more honest troopers bemoaning the loss, and questioning the honor of those to whose safe-keeping it had been entrusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>Finally, doubtless under the apprehension that through their irregularities the corn would all disappear and find its way to the horses in accordance with the stealthy enterprise of their owners, a general raid was made on the field in broad daylight, and though the guard drove off the marauders, I must admit that its efforts to keep them back were so unsuccessful that my hopes for an equal distribution of the crop were quickly blasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/><num value="1">One</num> look at the field told that it had been swept clean of its grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>Of course a great row occurred as to who was to blame, and many arrests and trials took place, but there had been such an interchanging of cap numbers and other insignia that it was next to impossible to identify the guilty, and so much crimination and acrimony grew out of the affair that it was deemed best to drop the whole matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>The torments of this trying situation were almost unbearable, but it was obvious to all that it was necessary to have at hand a compact body of troops to repel any assault the enemy might make pending the reconstruction of the extreme right of our line, and a silent determination to stay seemed to take hold of each individual soldier; nor was this grim silence interrupted throughout the cannonade, except in <num value="1">one</num> instance, when <num value="1">one</num> of the regiments broke out in a lusty cheer as a startled rabbit in search of a new hiding-place safely ran the whole length of the line on the backs of the men. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>Feeling confident that I could persuade Card to undertake the perilous duty, I broached the contemplated project to him, and he at once jumped at the opportunity of thus distinguishing himself, saying that with <num value="1">one</num> of his brothers and <num value="3">three</num> other loyal East Tennesseeans, whose services he knew could be enlisted, he felt sure of carrying out the idea, so I gave him authority to choose his own assistants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>I waited in patience for such news, but none came, and as the time Card had allotted himself passed by, I watched anxiously for his return, for, as there was scarcely a doubt that the expedition had proved a failure, the fate of the party became a matter of deep concern to Card's remaining brother and to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>Their prospects now were decidedly discouraging, for death stared them in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>His surmise proved correct; for news soon came that the poor boy had been captured at his father's house, and hanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>The blow to Card was a severe <num value="1">one</num>, and so hardened his heart against the guerrillas in the neighborhood of his father's home &mdash; for he knew they were guilty of his brother's murder &mdash; that it was with difficulty I could persuade him to continue in the employment of the <rs>Government</rs>, so determined was he to avenge his brother's death at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>Finally, however, I succeeded in quieting the almost uncontrollable rage that seemed to possess him, and he remained with me during the <name>Tullahoma</name> and <placeName reg="Shepherd, Chattanooga, Hamilton" key="tgn,2098422">Chickamauga</placeName> campaigns; but when we reached <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> the next winter, he took his departure, informing me that he was <hi rend="italics">going for</hi> the bushwhackers who had killed his brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>The feeding of our army from the base at <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName> was attended with a great many difficulties, as the enemy's cavalry was constantly breaking the railroad and intercepting our communications on the <rs>Cumberland</rs> <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> River at different points that were easily accessible to his then superior force of troopers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>The accumulation of reserve stores was therefore not an easy task, and to get forage ahead a few days was wellnigh impossible, unless that brought from the <rs>North</rs> was supplemented by what we could gather from the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>In nearly every <num value="1">one</num> of these expeditions the enemy was encountered, and the wagons were usually loaded while the skirmishers kept up a running fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>The officer in direct command always reported to me personally whatever had happened during the time he was out &mdash; the result of his reconnoissance, so to speak, for that was the real nature of these excursions-and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion the colonel in command, <persName n="Conrad,Colonel,,,," id="n0035.0015.00137.00855" reg="nearbymention:Conrad,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Conrad</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MO15">Fifteenth Missouri</orgName>, informed me that he got through without much difficulty; in fact, that everything had gone all right and been eminently satisfactory, except that in returning he had been mortified greatly by the conduct of <hi rend="italics">the <num value="2">two</num> females belonging to the detachment and division train at my headquarters</hi>. These women, he said, had given much annoyance by getting drunk, and to some extent demoralizing his men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>Inquiring who they were and for further details, I was informed that there certainly were in the command <num value="2">two</num> females, that in some mysterious manner had attached themselves to the service as soldiers; that <num value="1">one</num>, an <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> woman, was a teamster in the division wagontrain and the other a private soldier in a <orgName n="Cavalry company" type="company">cavalry company</orgName> temporarily attached to my headquarters for escort duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>After they had been fished from the water, in the process of resuscitation their sex was disclosed, though up to this time it appeared to be known only to each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>By <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> on the morning of <dateStruct value="-09-22"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="22">22</day></dateStruct> my command took up a position within the heavy line of intrenchments at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, the greater part of which defenses had been thrown up since the army commenced arriving there the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>The enemy, having now somewhat recovered from the shock of the recent battle, followed carefully, and soon invested us close into our lines with a parallel system of rifle-pits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>He also began at once to erect permanent lines of earthworks on <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> and to establish himself strongly on <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>He then sent <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n0035.0017.00159.01073" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,William,H.,,:2"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> north of the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, and, aided greatly by the configuration of the ground, held us in a state of partial siege, which serious rains might convert into a complete investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>The occupation of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> broke our direct communication with Bridgeport-our sub-depot-and forced us to bring supplies by way of the <rs type="place">Sequatchie Valley</rs> and <placeName reg="Waldron's Ridge">Waldron's Ridge</placeName> of the <rs type="place">Cumberland Mountains</rs>, over a road most difficult even in the summer season, but now liable to be rendered impassable by autumn rains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>The distance to <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName> by this circuitous route was <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure>, and the numerous passes, coves, and small valleys through which the road ran offered tempting opportunities for the destruction of trains, and the enemy was not slow to take advantage of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>Indeed, the situation was not promising, and <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0035.0017.00159.01074" reg="nearbymention:Rosecrans,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> himself, in communicating with the <rs>President</rs> the day succeeding the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs>, expressed doubts of his ability to hold the gateway of the <rs type="place">Cumberland Mountains</rs>. <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>The position taken up by my troops inside the lines of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> was near the old iron-works, under the shadow of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>Here we were exposed to a continual fire from the enemy's batteries for many days, but as the men were well covered by secure though simple intrenchments, but little damage was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>My own headquarters were established on the grounds of <persName n="Crutchfield,Mister,William,,," id="n0035.0017.00160.01075" reg="default:Crutchfield,William,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Crutchfield</surname></persName>, a resident of the place, whose devotion to the <rs>Union</rs> cause knew no bounds, and who rendered me-and, in fact, at <num value="1">one</num> time or another, nearly every general officer in the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName>-invaluable service in the way of information about the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>My headquarters camp frequently received shots from the <rs type="place">point of Lookout Mountain</rs> also, but fortunately no casualties resulted from this plunging fire, though, I am free to confess, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> our nerves were often upset by the whirring of <num value="20">twenty</num>-pounder shells dropped inconsiderately into our camp at untimely hours of the night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>In a few days rain began to fall, and the mountain roads by which our supplies came were fast growing impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>Each succeeding train of wagons took longer to make the trip from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, and the draft mules were dying by the hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>The artillery horses would soon go too, and there was every prospect that later the troops would starve unless something could be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>Luckily for my division, a company of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2KYCav">Second Kentucky Cavalry</orgName> had attached itself to my headquarters, and, though there without authority, had been left undisturbed in view of a coming reorganization of the army incidental to the removal of <persName n="McCook,,,,," id="n0035.0017.00160.01076" reg="nearbymention:McCook,Dan,,,"><surname>McCook</surname></persName> and <persName n="Crittenden,,,,," id="n0035.0017.00160.01077" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,Thomas,L.,,:2"><surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> from the command of their respective corps, a measure that had been determined upon immediately after the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>Desiring to remain with me, <persName n="Thickstun,Captain,Lowell,H.,," id="n0035.0017.00160.01078" reg="default:Thickstun,Lowell,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Lowell</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Thickstun</surname></persName>, commanding this company, was ready for any duty I might find for him, so I ordered him into the <rs type="place">Sequatchie Valley</rs> for the purpose of collecting supplies for my troops, and sent my scout Card along to guide him to the best locations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>The company hid itself away in a deep cove in the upper end of the valley, and by keeping very quiet and paying for everything it took from the people, in a few days was enabled to send me large quantities of corn for my animals and food for the officers and men, which greatly supplemented the scanty supplies we were getting from the sub-depot at <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>In this way I carried men and animals through our beleaguerment in pretty fair condition, and of the turkeys, chickens, ducks, and eggs sent in for the messes of my officers we often had enough to divide liberally among those at different headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>Later, after the <rs n="Battle of Missionary Ridge" type="battle">battle of Missionary Ridge</rs>, when I started to <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, the company joined me in excellent shape, bringing with it an abundance of food, including a small herd of beef cattle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>The whole time my line remained near the ironmills the shelling from Lookout was kept up, the screeching shots inquisitively asking in their well-known way, <quote>Where are you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>Where are you?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>but it is strange to see how readily soldiers can become accustomed to the sound of dangerous missiles under circumstances of familiarity, and this case was no exception to the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>Few casualties occurred, and soon contempt took the place of nervousness, and as we could not reply in kind on account of the elevation required for our guns the men responded by Jeers and imprecation of whenever a shell fell into their camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>Meantime, orders having been issued for the organization of the army, additional troops were attached to my command, and it became the <orgName type="division" n="Division 2">Second Division</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 4">Fourth Army Corps</orgName>, to which <persName n="Granger,Major-General,Gordon,,," id="n0035.0017.00161.01080" reg="default:Granger,Gordon,,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <foreName>Gordon</foreName> <surname>Granger</surname></persName> was assigned as commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>This necessitated a change of position of the division, and I moved to ground behind our works, with my right resting on <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Fort Negley</placeName> and my left extending well over toward <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Fort Wood</placeName>, my front being parallel to <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>These men I left in <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> to await the arrival of my train, which I now learned was <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> with shoes, overcoats, and other clothing, and with the rest of the division proceeded to <placeName reg="Strawberry Plains">Strawberry Plains</placeName>, which we reached the latter part of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>Mid-winter was now upon us, and the weather in this mountain region of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> was very cold, snow often falling to the depth of several inches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>The thin and scanty clothing of the men afforded little protection, and while in bivouac their only shelter was the ponchos with which they had been provided before leaving <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>; there was not a tent in the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>Hence great suffering resulted, which I anxiously hoped would be relieved shortly by the arrival of my train with supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>In the course of time the wagons reached <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, but my troops derived little comfort from this fact, for the train was stopped by <persName n="Foster,General,,,," id="n0035.0018.00179.01323" reg="mostcommon:Foster,George,P.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName>, who had succeeded <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00179.01324" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,Ambrose,E.,,:1"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> in command of the department, its contents distributed <hi rend="italics">pro rata</hi> to the different organizations of the entire army, and I received but a small share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>This was very disappointing, not to say exasperating, but I could not complain of unfairness, for every command in the army was suffering to the same extent as mine, and yet it did seem that a little forethought and exertion on the part of some of the other superior officers, whose transportation was in tolerable condition, might hare ameliorated the situation considerably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>I sent the train back at once for more clothing, and on its return, just before reaching <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, the quartermaster in charge, <persName n="Smith,Captain,Philip,,," id="n0035.0018.00179.01325" reg="default:Smith,Philip,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Philip</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, filled the open spaces in the wagons between the bows and load with fodder and hay, and by this clever stratagem passed it through the town safe and undisturbed as a forage train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>He was on the eve of setting out to <quote>whip the enemy's cavalry,</quote> as he said, and wanted me to go along and see him do it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>As there were indications of a considerable force of the enemy on the <placeName reg="Russellville, Hamblen, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101358">Russellville</placeName> road I decided to place the troops in line of battle, so as to be prepared for any emergency that might arise in the absence of the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officers</rs>, and I deemed it prudent to supervise personally the encamping of the men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>Feeling that all was secure, I returned to my headquarters in the village with the idea that we were safely established in case of attack, and that the men would now have a good rest if left undisturbed, and plenty to eat, but hardly had I reached my own camp when a staff-officer came post-haste from <persName n="Sturgis,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01334" reg="mostcommon:Sturgis,nomatch:0"><surname>Sturgis</surname></persName> with the information that he was being driven back to my lines, despite the confident invitation to me (in the morning) to go out and witness the whipping which was to be given to the enemy's cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>Riding to the front, I readily perceived that the information was correct, and I had to send a brigade of infantry out to help <persName n="Sturgis,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01335" reg="mostcommon:Sturgis,nomatch:0"><surname>Sturgis</surname></persName>, thus relieving him from a rather serious predicament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>Indeed, the enemy was present in pretty strong force, both cavalry and infantry, and from his vicious attack on <persName n="Sturgis,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01336" reg="mostcommon:Sturgis,nomatch:0"><surname>Sturgis</surname></persName> it looked very much as though he intended to bring on a general engagement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>Under such circumstances I deemed it advisable that the responsible commanders of the army should be present, and so informed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>My communication brought <persName n="Parke,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01337" reg="mostcommon:Parke,nomatch:0"><surname>Parke</surname></persName> and <persName n="Granger,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01338" reg="nearbymention:Granger,Gordon,,,"><surname>Granger</surname></persName> to the front without delay, but <persName n="Foster,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01339" reg="mostcommon:Foster,George,P.,,:1"><surname>Foster</surname></persName> could not come, since the hardships of the winter had reopened an old wound received during the <rs>Mexican War</rs>, and brought on much suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>By the time <rs>Parke</rs> and <rs>Granger</rs> arrived, however, the enemy, who it turned out was only making a strong demonstration to learn the object of our movement on <placeName key="tgn,2098756" n="1.000 20" reg="dandridge, jefferson, tennessee">Dandridge</placeName>, seemed satisfied with the results of his reconnoissance, and began falling back toward <placeName reg="Bull's Gap, Hawkins, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098184">Bull's Gap</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>Meanwhile <persName n="Parke,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01340" reg="mostcommon:Parke,nomatch:0"><surname>Parke</surname></persName> and <persName n="Granger,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01341" reg="nearbymention:Granger,Gordon,,,"><surname>Granger</surname></persName> concluded that <persName n="Dandridge,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00180.01342" reg="mostcommon:Dandridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Dandridge</surname></persName> was an untenable point, and hence decided to withdraw a part of the army to <placeName reg="Strawberry Plains">Strawberry Plains</placeName>; and the question of supplies again coming up, it was determined to send the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 4">Fourth Corps</orgName> to the south side of the <rs>French</rs> <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> Broad to obtain subsistence, provided we could bridge the river so that men could get across the deep and icy stream without suffering. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>I agreed to undertake the construction of a bridge on condition that each division should send to the ford <num value="25">twenty-five</num> wagons with which to make it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>As my quota of wagons arrived, they were drawn into the stream <num value="1">one</num> after another by the wheel team, <num value="6">six</num> men in each wagon, and as they successively reached the other side of the channel the mules were unhitched, the pole of each wagon run under the hind axle of the <num value="1">one</num> just in front, and the tail-boards used so as to span the slight space between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>The plan worked well as long as the material lasted, but no other wagons than my <num value="25">twenty-five</num> coming on the ground, the work stopped when the bridge was only half constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>Informed of the delay and its cause, in sheer desperation I finished the bridge by taking from my own division all the wagons needed to make up the deficiency. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>I sent to headquarters information of the plight I was in-baggage and supplies on the bank and wagons in the stream-begged to know what was to become of them if we were to hurry off at a moment's notice, and suggested that the movement be delayed until I could recover my transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>Receiving in reply no assurances that I should be relieved from my dilemma-and, in fact, nothing satisfactory &mdash; I determined to take upon myself the responsibility of remaining on the ground long enough to get my wagons out of the river; so I sent out a heavy force to watch for the enemy, and with the remainder of the command went to work to break up the bridge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>Before daylight next morning I had recovered everything without interference by <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0035.0018.00181.01345" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, who, it was afterward ascertained, was preparing to move east toward <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> instead of marching to attack us; the small demonstration against <placeName key="tgn,2098756" n="1.000 20" reg="dandridge, jefferson, tennessee">Dandridge</placeName>, being made simply to deceive us as to his ultimate object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>I marched to <placeName reg="Strawberry Plains">Strawberry Plains</placeName> unmolested, and by taking the route over <placeName reg="Bays Mountains, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,7022454">Bay's Mountain</placeName>, a shorter <num value="1">one</num> than that followed by the main body of our troops, reached the point of rendezvous as soon as the most of the army, for the road it followed was not only longer, but badly cut up by trains that had recently passed over it. <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>Shortly after getting into camp, the beef contractor came in and reported that a detachment of the enemy's cavalry had captured my herd of beef cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>This caused me much chagrin at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but the commissary of my division soon put in an appearance, and assured me that the loss would not be very disastrous to us nor of much benefit to the enemy, since the cattle were so poor and weak that they could not be driven off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>The corps presented a fine appearance at the review, and so far as the health and equipment of the men were concerned the showing was good and satisfactory, but the horses were thin and very much worn down by excessive and, it seemed to me, unnecessary picket duty, for the cavalry picket-line almost completely encircled the infantry and artillery camps of the army, covering a distance, on a continuous line, of nearly <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure>, with hardly a mounted Confederate confronting it at any point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>From the very beginning of the war the enemy had shown more wisdom respecting his cavalry than we.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>Before and at the review I took in this situation, and determined to remedy it if possible; so in due time I sought an interview with <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0035.0019.00193.01478" reg="mostcommon:Meade,G.,G.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> and informed him that, as the effectiveness of my command rested mainly on the strength of its horses, I thought the duty it was then performing was both burdensome and wasteful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>I also gave him my idea as to what the cavalry should do, the main purport of which was that it ought to be kept concentrated to fight the enemy's cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>I told him that if he would let me use the cavalry as I contemplated, he need have little solicitude in these respects, for, with a mass of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> mounted men, it was my belief that I could make <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> it so lively for the enemy's cavalry that, so far as attacks from it were concerned, the flanks and rear of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> would require little or no defense, and claimed, further, that moving columns of infantry should take care of their own fronts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>I also told him that it was my object to defeat the enemy's cavalry in a general combat, if possible, and by such a result establish a feeling of confidence in my own troops that would enable us after a while to march where we pleased, for the purpose of breaking <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0035.0019.00194.01483" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s communications and destroying the resources from which his army was supplied. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>While occupying the ground between <placeName reg="Clifton, Greenlee, Arizona" key="tgn,2006679">Clifton</placeName> and <placeName reg="Berryville, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2110642">Berryville</placeName>, referred to in the last chapter of the preceding volume, I felt the need of an efficient body of scouts to collect information regarding the enemy, for the defective intelligence-establishment with which I started out from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> early in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> had not proved satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>I therefore began to organize my scouts on a system which I hoped would give better results than had the method hitherto pursued in the department, which was to employ on this service doubtful citizens and Confederate deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>If these should turn out untrustworthy, the mischief they might do us gave me grave apprehension, and I finally concluded that those of our own soldiers who should volunteer for the delicate and hazardous duty would be the most valuable material, and decided <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> that they should have a battalion organization and be commanded by an officer, <persName n="Young,Major,H.,K.,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02558" reg="default:Young,H.,K.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>K.</foreName> <surname>Young</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1RIInfantry">First Rhode Island Infantry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>These men were disguised in Confederate uniforms whenever necessary, were paid from the <orgName n="Secret Service Fund" type="fund">Secret-Service Fund</orgName> in proportion to the value of the intelligence they furnished, which often stood us in good stead in checking the forays of <persName n="Gilmore,,,,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02559" reg="mostcommon:Gilmore,Harry,,,:1"><surname>Gilmore</surname></persName>, <persName n="Mosby,,,,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02560" reg="mostcommon:Mosby,nomatch:0"><surname>Mosby</surname></persName>, and other irregulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>Beneficial results came from the plan in many other ways too, and particularly so when in a few days <num value="2">two</num> of my scouts put me in the way of getting news conveyed from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>They had learned that just outside of my lines, near <placeName key="tgn,2113037" n="1.000 11" reg="millwood, clarke, virginia">Millwood</placeName>, there was living an old colored man, who had a permit from the <rs>Confederate</rs> commander to go into <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> and return <num value="3">three</num> times a week, for the purpose of selling vegetables to the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>The scouts had sounded this man, and, finding him both loyal and shrewd, suggested that he might be made useful to us within the enemy's lines; and the proposal struck me as feasible, provided there could be found in <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> some reliable person who would be willing to co-operate and correspond with me. I asked <persName n="Crook,General,,,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02561" reg="nearbymention:Crook,George,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Crook</surname></persName>, who was acquainted with many of the <rs>Union</rs> people of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, if he knew of such a person, and he recommended <persName n="Wright,Miss,Rebecca,,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02562" reg="default:Wright,Rebecca,,,"><roleName n="Miss">a Miss</roleName> <foreName>Rebecca</foreName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>, a young lady whom he had met there before the <rs n="Battle of Kernstown" type="battle">battle of Kernstown</rs>, who, he said, was a member of the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName> and the teacher of a small private school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>He knew she was faithful and loyal to the <rs>Government</rs>, and thought she might be willing to render us assistance, but he could not be certain of this, for on account of her well-known loyalty she was under constant surveillance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>I hesitated at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but finally deciding to try it, despatched the <num value="2">two</num> scouts to the old negro's cabin, and they brought him to my headquarters late that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>I was soon convinced of the negro's fidelity, and asking him if he was acquainted with <persName n="Wright,Miss,Rebecca,,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02563" reg="default:Wright,Rebecca,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Rebecca</foreName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, he replied that he knew her well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>Thereupon I told him what I wished to do. and after a little persuasion he agreed to carry a letter to her on his next marketing trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>My message was prepared by writing it on tissue paper, which was then compressed into a small pellet, and protected by wrapping it in tin-foil so that it could be safely carried in the man's mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>The probability of his being searched when he came to the <rs>Confederate</rs> picket-line was not remote, and in such event he was to swallow the pellet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>The letter appealed to <persName n="Wright,Miss,,,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02564" reg="nearbymention:Wright,Rebecca,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>'s loyalty and patriotism, and, requested her to furnish me with information regarding the strength and condition of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02565" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,A.,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>The night before the negro started <num value="1">one</num> of the scouts placed the oddlooking communication in his hands, with renewed injunctions as to secrecy and promptitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>Early the next morning it was delivered to <persName n="Wright,Miss,,,," id="n0035.0026.00276.02566" reg="nearbymention:Wright,Rebecca,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>, with an intimation that a letter of importance was enclosed in <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> the tin-foil, the negro telling her at the same time that she might expect him to call for a message in reply before his return home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Wright,Miss,,,," id="n0035.0026.00277.02567" reg="nearbymention:Wright,Rebecca,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName> began to open the pellet nervously, but when told to be careful, and to preserve the foil as a wrapping for her answer, she proceeded slowly and carefully, and when the note appeared intact the messenger retired, remarking again that in the evening he would come for an answer. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>I asked him if the firing was continuous or only desultory, to which he replied that it was not a sustained fire, but rather irregular and fitful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>I remarked: <quote>It's all right; <persName n="Grover,,,,," id="n0035.0028.00318.03549" reg="nearbymention:Grover,Cuvier,,,"><surname>Grover</surname></persName> has gone out this morning to make a reconnoissance, and he is merely feeling the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>I tried to go to sleep again, but grew so restless that I could not, and soon got up and dressed myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>A little later the picket officer came back and reported that the firing, which could be distinctly heard from his line on the heights outside of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, was still going on. I asked him if it sounded like a battle, and <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> as he again said that it did not, I still inferred that the cannonading was caused by <orgName n="division"><persName n="Grover,,,,," id="n0035.0028.00319.03550" reg="nearbymention:Grover,Cuvier,,,"><surname>Grover</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> banging away at the enemy simply to find out what he was up to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>The parish Boards of Registration were composed of <num value="3">three</num> members each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>Ability to take what was known as the <quote>iron-clad oath</quote> was the qualification exacted of the members, and they were prohibited from becoming candidates for office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>In the execution of their duties they were to be governed by the provisions of the supplemental act. It was also made <num value="1">one</num> of their functions to designate the number and location of the polling-places in the several districts, to appoint commissioners for receiving the votes and in general to attend to such other matters as were necessary, in order properly to conduct the voting, and afterward to receive from the commissioners the result of the vote and forward it to my headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>These registers, and all other officers having to do with elections, were to be held to a rigid accountability, and be subject to trial by <orgName n="Military Commission" type="commission">military commission</orgName> for fraud or unlawful or improper conduct in the performance of their duties; and in order to be certain that the <rs>Registration Boards</rs> performed their work faithfully and intelligently, officers of the army were appointed as supervisors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>To this end <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> the parishes were grouped together conveniently in temporary districts, each officer having from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="5">five</num> parishes to supervise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>The programme thus mapped out for carrying out the law in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> was likewise adhered to in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, and indeed was followed as a model in some of the other military districts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>Although Military Commissions were fully authorized by the <name>Reconstruction</name> acts, yet I did not favor their use in governing the district, and probably would never have convened <num value="1">one</num> had these acts been observed in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>I much preferred that the civil courts, and the <rs>State</rs> and municipal authorities already in existence, should perform their functions without military control or interference, but occasionally, because the civil authorities neglected their duty, I was obliged to resort to this means to ensure the punishment of offenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>At this time the condition of the negroes in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> was lamentable, though, in fact, not worse than that of the few white loyalists who had been true to the <rs>Union</rs> during the war. These last were singled out as special objects of attack, and were, therefore, obliged at all times to be on the alert for the protection of their lives and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>This was the natural outcome of <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0036.00433.04946" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s defiance of Congress, coupled with the sudden conversion to his cause of persons in the <rs>North</rs> who but a short time before had been his bitterest enemies; for all this had aroused among the disaffected element new hopes of power and place, hopes of being at once put in political control again, with a resumption of their functions in State and National matters without any preliminary authorization by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>In fact, it was not only hoped, but expected, that things were presently to go on just as if there had been no war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>In the <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">State of Texas</placeName> there were in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> about <num value="200000">200,000</num> of the colored race-roughly, <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of the entire population-while in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> there were not less than <num value="350000">350,000</num>, or more than <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of all the people in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>Until the enactment of the <name>Reconstruction</name> laws these negroes were without rights, and though they had been liberated by the war, <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0036.00433.04947" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s policy now proposed that they should have no political status at all, and consequently be at the mercy of a people who, recently their masters, now seemed to look upon them as the authors of all the misfortunes that had come upon the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>Under these circumstances the blacks naturally turned for protection to those who had been the means of their liberation, and it would have been little less than inhuman to deny them sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>Their freedom had been given them, and it was the plain duty of those in authority to make it secure, and screen them from the bitter political resentment that beset them, and to see that they had a fair chance in the battle of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>Therefore, when outrages and murders grew frequent; and the aid of the military <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> power was an absolute necessity for the protection of life, I employed it unhesitatingly &mdash; the guilty parties being brought to trial before military commissions-and for a time, at least, there occurred a halt in the march of terrorism inaugurated by the people whom <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0036.00434.04948" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had deluded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>The <orgName n="Military Commission 1" type="commission">first Military Commission</orgName> was convened to try the case of <persName n="Walker,,John,W.,," id="n0035.0036.00434.04949" reg="default:Walker,John,W.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, charged with shooting a negro in the parish of <placeName reg="Saint John, Barbados, North and Central America" key="tgn,7018221">St. John</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>The proper civil authorities had made no effort to arrest <persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n0035.0036.00434.04950" reg="nearbymention:Walker,John,W.,,"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>, and even connived at his escape, so I had him taken into custody in New Orleans, and ordered him tried, the commission finding him guilty, and sentencing him to confinement in the penitentiary for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. This shooting was the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> occurrence of the kind that had taken place in <placeName reg="Saint Johns, Florida, United States" key="tgn,2000283">St. John's parish</placeName>, a negro being wounded in each case, and it was plain that the intention was to institute there a practice of intimidation which should be effective to subject the freedmen to the will of their late masters, whether in making labor contracts, or in case these newly enfranchised negroes should evince a disposition to avail themselves of the privilege to vote. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/>The trial and conviction of <persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n0035.0036.00434.04951" reg="nearbymention:Walker,John,W.,,"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>, and of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> others for similar outrages, soon put a stop to every kind of <quote>bull-dozing</quote> in the country parishes; but about this time I discovered that many members of the police force in New Orleans were covertly intimidating the freedmen there, and preventing their appearance at the registration offices, using milder methods than had obtained in the country, it is true, but none the less effective. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/>Early in <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct> the <name>Legislature</name> had passed an act which created for the police of New Orleans a residence qualification, the object of which was to discharge and exclude from the force ex-Union soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>This of course would make room for the appointment of ex-Confederates, and <persName n="Monroe,Mayor,,,," id="n0035.0036.00434.04952" reg="nearbymention:Monroe,John,T.,,"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName> had not been slow in enforcing the provisions of the law. It was, in fact, a result of this enactment that the police was so reorganized as to become the willing and efficient tool which it proved to be in the riot of <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>; and having still the same personnel, it was now in shape to prevent registration by threats, unwarranted arrests, and by various other influences, all operating to keep the timid blacks away from the registration places. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>That the police were taking a hand in this practice of repression, I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered by the conduct of the assistant to the chief of the body, and at once removed the offender, but finding this ineffectual I annulled that part of the <rs>State</rs> law fixing the <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> residence restriction, and restored the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> qualification, thus enabling <persName n="Heath,Mayor,,,," id="n0035.0036.00434.04953" reg="nearbymention:Heath,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Heath</surname></persName>, who by my appointment had succeeded <persName n="Monroe,,,,," id="n0035.0036.00434.04954" reg="nearbymention:Monroe,John,T.,,"><surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, to organize the <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> force anew, and take about <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of its members from ex-Union soldiers who when discharged had settled in New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3760"/>This action put an end to intimidation in the parish of <placeName key="tgn,2000889;tgn,1002753;tgn,1002752" n="0.091 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2000889;name,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.091 000000.9090	placename;tgn,1002753;name,Vermont,United States,North and Central America;0.091 000000.9090	placename;tgn,1002752;name,New York,United States,North and Central America" reg="name,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;name,Vermont,United States,North and Central America;name,New York,United States,North and Central America">Orleans</placeName>; and now were put in operation in all sections the processes provided by the supplemental Reconstruction law for the summoning of a convention to form a Constitution preparatory to the readmission of the <rs>State</rs>, and I was full of hope that there would now be much less difficulty in administering the trust imposed by Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>During the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> previous great damage had been done the agricultural interests of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> by the overflow of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, the levees being so badly broken as to require extensive repairs, and the <name>Legislature</name> of <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct> had appropriated for the purpose <measure n="4000000dollars" type="currency">$4,000,000</measure>, to be raised by an issue of bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>This money was to be disbursed by a Board of Levee Commissioners then in existence, but the term of service of these commissioners, and the law creating the board, would expire in the spring of <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3763"/>In order to overcome this difficulty the <name>Legislature</name> passed a bill continuing the commissioners in office, but as the act was passed inside of <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> before the adjournment of the <name>Legislature</name>, <persName n="Wells,Governor,,,," id="n0035.0036.00435.04955" reg="mostcommon:Wells,William,,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Wells</surname></persName> pocketed the bill, and it failed to become a law. The Governor then appointed a board of his own, without any warrant of law whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3764"/>The old commissioners refused to recognize this new board, and of course a conflict of authority ensued, which, it was clear, would lead to vicious results if allowed to continue; so, as the people of the <rs>State</rs> had no confidence in either of the boards, I decided to end the contention summarily by appointing an entirely new commission, which would disburse the money honestly, and further the real purpose for which it had been appropriated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3765"/>When I took this course the legislative board acquiesced, but <persName n="Wells,Governor,,,," id="n0035.0036.00435.04956" reg="mostcommon:Wells,William,,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Wells</surname></persName> immediately requested the <rs>President</rs> to revoke my order, which, however, was not done, but meanwhile the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> directed me to suspend all proceedings in the matter, and make a report of the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3766"/>I complied in the following telegram:

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3767"/>Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of this date in reference to the <rs>Levee Commissioners</rs> in this State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3768"/>The following were my reasons for abolishing the <num value="2">two</num> former boards, although I intended that my order should be sufficiently explanatory: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>Previous to the adjournment of the <name>Legislature</name> last winter it passed an act continuing the old Levee board in office, so that the <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of dollars <pb id="p.436" n="436"/> (<measure n="4000000dollars" type="currency">$4,000,000</measure>) in bonds appropriated by the <name>Legislature</name> might be disbursed by a board of rebellious antecedents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3770"/>After its adjournment the <rs>Governor</rs> of the <rs>State</rs> appointed a board of his own, in violation of this act, and made the acknowledgment to me in person that his object was to disburse the money in the interest of his own party by securing for it the vote of the employes at the time of election. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3771"/>The board continued in office by the <name>Legislature</name> refused to turn over to the <rs>Governor</rs>'s board, and each side appealed to me to sustain it, which I would not do. The question must then have gone to the courts, which, according to the <rs>Governor</rs>'s judgment when he was appealing to me to be sustained, would require <num value="1">one</num> year for decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3772"/>Meantime the <rs>State</rs> was overflowed, the <name>Levee</name> boards tied up by political chicanery, and nothing done to relieve the poor people, now fed by the charity of the <rs>Government</rs> and charitable associations of the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3773"/>To obviate this trouble, and to secure to the overflowed districts of the <rs>State</rs> the immediate relief which the honest disbursement of the <num value="4000000">four millions</num> (<measure n="4000000dollars" type="currency">$4,000,000</measure>) would give, my order dissolving both boards was issued. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3774"/>I say now, unequivocally, that <persName n="Wells,Governor,,,," id="n0035.0036.00436.04957" reg="mostcommon:Wells,William,,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Wells</surname></persName> is a political trickster and a dishonest man. I have seen him myself, when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came to this command, turn out all the <rs>Union</rs> men who had supported the <rs>Government</rs>, and put in their stead rebel soldiers who had not yet doffed their gray uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3775"/>I have seen him again, during the <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> riot of <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>, skulk away where I could not find him to give him a guard, instead of coming out as a manly representative of the <rs>State</rs> and joining those who were preserving the peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3776"/>I have watched him since, and his conduct has been as sinuous as the mark left in the dust by the movement of a snake. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3777"/>I say again that he is dishonest, and that dishonesty is more than must be expected of me. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3793"/>The date set for closing the books was the <dateStruct value="-06-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, but in the parish of <placeName reg="Orleans, Louisiana, United States" key="tgn,2000889">Orleans</placeName> the time was extended till the <dateStruct value="-07-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3794"/>This the <rs>President</rs> considered too short a period, and therefore directed the registry lists not to be closed before the <dateStruct value="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, unless there was some good reason to the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3795"/>This was plainly designed to keep the books open in order that under the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>'s interpretation of the <name>Reconstruction</name> laws, published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3796"/><dateStruct value="-06-20"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="20">20</day></dateStruct>, many persons who had been excluded by the <pb id="p.438" n="438"/> registration boards could yet be registered, so I decided to close the registration, unless required by the <rs>President</rs> unconditionally, and in specific orders, to extend the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/>My motives were manifold, but the main reasons were that as <measure n="2.5months" type="date">two and a half months</measure> had been given already, the number of persons who, under the law, were qualified for registry was about exhausted, and because of the expense I did not feel warranted in keeping up the boards longer, as I said, <quote>to suit new issues coming in at the <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> hour,</quote> which would but open a <quote>broad macadamized road for perjury and fraud.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/></p> 
<p>When I thus stated what I intended to do, the opinion of the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> had not yet been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3799"/>When it did reach me it was merely in the form of a circular signed by <persName n="Townsend,Adjutant General,,,," id="n0035.0036.00438.04981" reg="mostcommon:Townsend,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</roleName> <surname>Townsend</surname></persName>, and had no force of law. It was not even sent as an order, nor was it accompanied by any instructions, or by anything except the statement that it was transmitted to the <quote>respective military commanders for their information, in order that there might be uniformity in the execution</quote> of the <name>Reconstruction</name> acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3800"/>To adopt <persName n="Stanbery,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0036.00438.04982" reg="nearbymention:Stanbery,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanbery</surname></persName>'s interpretation of the law and reopen registration accordingly, would defeat the purpose of Congress, as well as add to my perplexities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>Such a course would also require that the officers appointed by me for the performance of specified duties, under laws which I was empowered to interpret and enforce, should receive their guidance and instructions from an unauthorized source, so on communicating with <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0035.0036.00438.04983" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> as to how I should act, he directed me to enforce my own construction of the military bill until ordered to do otherwise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3802"/>Therefore the registration continued as I had originally directed, and nothing having been definitely settled at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> in relation to my extending the time, on the <dateStruct value="-07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> I ordered all the registration boards to select, immediately, suitable persons to act as commissioners of election, and at the same time specified the number of each set of commissioners, designated the polling-places, gave notice that <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> would be allowed for voting, and followed this with an order discontinuing registration the <dateStruct value="-07-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and then another appointing the <dateStruct value="-09-27"><day reg="27">27th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-09-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> as the time for the election of delegates to the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State convention</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3803"/>In accomplishing the registration there had been little opposition from the mass of the people, but the press of New Orleans, and the office-holders and office-seekers in the <rs>State</rs> generally, antagonized the work bitterly and violently, particularly after the promulgation of the opinion of the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3805"/>It also tempted certain municipal officers in New Orleans to perform illegal acts that would seriously have affected the credit of the city had matters not been promptly corrected by the summary removal from office of the comptroller and the treasurer, who had already issued <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure> in illegal certificates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/>On learning of this unwarranted and unlawful proceeding, <persName n="Heath,Mayor,,,," id="n0035.0036.00440.04985" reg="nearbymention:Heath,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Heath</surname></persName> demanded an investigation by the <orgName n="Common Council" type="council">Common Council</orgName>, but this body, taking its cue from the evident intention of the <rs>President</rs> to render abortive the <name>Reconstruction</name> acts, refused the mayor's demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>Then he tried to have the treasurer and comptroller restrained by injunction, but the city attorney, under the same inspiration as the council, declined to sue out a writ, and the attorney being supported in this course by nearly all the other officials, the mayor was left helpless in his endeavors to preserve the city's credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/>Under such circumstances he took the only step left him-recourse to the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commander</rs>; and after looking into the matter carefully I decided, in the early part of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, to give the mayor officials who would not refuse to make an investigation of the illegal issue of certificates, and to this end I removed the treasurer, <rs type="role" n="Surveyor">surveyor</rs>, comptroller.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3810"/>This action settled matters in the city, but subsequently I had to remove some officials in the parishes-among them a justice of the peace and a sheriff in the parish of <placeName reg="Rapides, Louisiana, United States" key="tgn,2000893">Rapides</placeName>; the justice for refusing to permit negro witnesses to testify in a certain murder case, and for allowing the murderer, who had foully killed a colored man, to walk out of his court on bail in the insignificant sum of <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>; and the sheriff, for conniving at the escape from jail of another alleged murderer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3811"/>Finding, however, even after these removals, that in the country districts murderers and other criminals went unpunished, provided the offenses were against negroes merely (since the jurors were selected exclusively from the whites, and often embraced those excluded from the exercise of the election franchise), I, having full authority under the <name>Reconstruction</name> laws, directed such a revision of the jury lists as would reject from them every man not eligible for registration as a voter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4108"/>On every hand appeared ample evidence that the <name>Indians</name> had intended to spend the winter here, for the ground was littered with jerked meat, bales of <rs n="buffalo robes" type="product">buffalo robes</rs>, cooking utensils, and all sorts of plunder usually accumulated in a permanent <name>Indian</name> camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4109"/>There were, also, lying dead near the villages hundreds of ponies, that had been shot to keep them from falling into our hands, the scant grazing and extreme cold having made them too weak to be driven along in the flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/>The wholesale slaughter of these ponies was a most cheering indication that our campaign would be ultimately successful, and we all prayed for at least a couple of months more of cold weather and plenty of snow. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4111"/>At the <name>Kiowa</name> village we found the body of a white woman--<persName n="Blynn,Mrs.,,,," id="n0035.0039.00471.05179" reg="mostcommon:Blynn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">a Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Blynn</surname></persName>-and also that of her child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4112"/>These captives had been taken by the <name>Kiowas</name> near <placeName key="tgn,2335379" n="1.000 11" reg="fort lyon, bent, colorado">Fort Lyon</placeName> the previous summer, and kept close prisoners until the stampede began, the poor woman being reserved to gratify the brutal lust of the chief, Satanta; then, however, <name>Indian</name> vengeance demanded the murder of the poor creatures, and after braining the little child against a tree, the mother was shot through the forehead, the weapon, which no doubt brought her welcome release, having been fired so close that the powder had horribly disfigured her face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4113"/>The <num value="2">two</num> bodies were wrapped in blankets and taken to camp, and afterward carried along in our march, till finally they were decently interred at <placeName key="tgn,2083105" n="1.000 1" reg="Davis, Murray, Oklahoma">Fort Arbuckle</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4114"/>At an early hour on <dateStruct value="-12-12"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="12">12</day></dateStruct> the command pulled out from its cosy camp and pushed down the <rs type="place">valley of the Washita</rs>, following immediately on the <rs>Indian</rs> trail which led in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName>, but before going far it was found that the many deep ravines and canions on this trail would delay our train very much, so we moved out of the valley and took the level prairie on the divide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4115"/>Here the traveling was good, and a rapid gait was kept up till mid-day, when, another storm of sleet and snow coming on, it became extremely difficult for the guides to make out the proper course; and fearing that we might get lost, or caught on the open plain without wood or water &mdash; as we had been on the <rs>Canadian</rs> &mdash; I turned the command back to the valley, resolved to try no more shortcuts involving the risk of a disaster to the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4116"/>But <pb id="p.472" n="472"/> to get back was no slight task, for a dense fog just now enveloped us, obscuring all landmarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4117"/>However, we were headed right when the fog set in, and we had the good luck to reach the valley before night-fall, though there was a great deal of floundering about, and also much disputing among the guides as to where the river would be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4118"/>Fortunately we struck the stream right at a large grove of timber, and established ourselves admirably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4119"/>By dark the ground was covered with <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="15inches" type="distance">fifteen inches</measure> of fresh snow, and as usual the temperature rose very sensibly while the storm was on, but after night-fall the snow ceased and the skies cleared up. Daylight having brought zero weather again, our start on the morning of the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> was painful work, many of the men freezing their fingers while handling the horse equipments, harness, and tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4120"/>However, we got off in fairly good season, and kept to the trail along the <rs>Washita</rs> notwithstanding the frequent digging and bridging necessary to get the wagons over ravines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4121"/>Continuing on this line for <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, we at length came to a point on the <rs>Washita</rs> where all signs indicated that we were nearing some of the villages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4122"/>Wishing to strike them as soon as possible, we made a very early start next morning, the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4123"/>A march of <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> brought us to a difficult ravine, and while we were making preparations to get over, word was brought that several <name>Indians</name> had appeared in our front bearing a white flag and making signs that they had a communication to deliver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4124"/>We signaled back that they would be received, when <num value="1">one</num> of the party came forward alone and delivered a letter, which proved to be from <persName n="Hazen,General,,,," id="n0035.0039.00472.05180" reg="mostcommon:Hazen,William,B.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hazen</surname></persName>, at <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4125"/>The letter showed that <persName n="Hazen,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00472.05181" reg="mostcommon:Hazen,William,B.,,:2"><surname>Hazen</surname></persName> was carrying on negotiations with the <name>Indians</name>, and stated that all the tribes between <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName> and my column were friendly, but the intimation was given that the <name>Cheyennes</name> and Arapahoes were still hostile, having moved off southward toward the <placeName reg="Red River, Brown, Texas" key="tgn,2611953">Red River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4126"/>It was added that Satanta and Lone <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00472.05182" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,nomatch:0"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName> &mdash; the chiefs of the Kiowas-would give information of the whereabouts of the hostiles; and such a communication coming direct from the representative of the <rs>Indian Department</rs>, practically took the <name>Kiowas</name> &mdash; the village at hand was of that tribe &mdash; under its protection, and also the <name>Comanches</name>, who were nearer in to <persName n="Cobb,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00472.05183" reg="mostcommon:Cobb,nomatch:0"><surname>Cobb</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4127"/>Of course, under such circumstances I was compelled to give up the intended attack, though I afterward regretted that I had paid any heed to the message, because Satanta and Lone <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00472.05184" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,nomatch:0"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName> proved, by trickery and double dealing, that they had deceived <persName n="Hazen,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00472.05185" reg="mostcommon:Hazen,William,B.,,:2"><surname>Hazen</surname></persName> into writing the letter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4128"/>When I informed the <name>Kiowas</name> that I would respect <persName n="Hazen,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00472.05186" reg="mostcommon:Hazen,William,B.,,:2"><surname>Hazen</surname></persName>'s letter provided they all came into <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName> and gave themselves up, the <num value="2">two</num> chiefs promised submission, and, as an evidence of good faith, proposed to accompany the column to <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName> with a large body of warriors, <pb id="p.473" n="473"/> while their villages moved to the same point by easy stages, along the opposite bank of the river-claiming this to be necessary from the poor condition of the ponies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4129"/>I had some misgivings as to the sincerity of Satanta and Lone <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00473.05187" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,nomatch:0"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName>, but as I wanted to get the <name>Kiowas</name> where their surrender would be complete, so that the <name>Cheyennes</name> and Arapahoes could then be pursued, I agreed to the proposition, and the column moved on. All went well that day, but the next it was noticed that the warriors were diminishing, and an investigation showed that a number of them had gone off on various pretexts &mdash; the main <num value="1">one</num> being to help along the women and children with the villages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4130"/>With this I suspected that they were playing me false, and my suspicions grew into certainty when Satanta himself tried to make his escape by slipping beyond the flank of the column and putting spurs to his pony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4131"/>Fortunately, several officers saw him, and quickly giving chase, overhauled him within a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>. I then arrested both him and Lone <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00473.05188" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,nomatch:0"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName> and held them as hostages &mdash; a measure that had the effect of bringing back many of the warriors already beyond our each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4132"/>When we arrived at <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName> we found some of the <name>Comanches</name> already there, and soon after the rest of them, excepting <num value="1">one</num> band, came in to the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4133"/>The <rs>Kiowas</rs>, however, were not on hand, and there were no signs to indicate their coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4134"/>At the end of <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> it was plain enough that they were acting in bad faith, and would continue to unless strong pressure was brought to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4135"/>Indeed, they had already started for the <rs type="place">Witchita Mountains</rs>, so I put on the screws at once by issuing an order to hang Satanta and Lone <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00473.05189" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,nomatch:0"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName>, if their people did not surrender at <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName> within <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>. The <num value="2">two</num> chiefs promised prompt compliance, but begged for more time, seeking to explain the non-arrival of the women and children through the weak condition of the ponies; but I was tired of their duplicity, and insisted of my ultimatum. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4136"/>The order for the execution brought quick fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4137"/>Runners were sent out with messages, by the <measure n="2" type="prisoners">two prisoners</measure>, appealing to their people to save the lives of their chiefs, and the result was that the whole tribe came in to the post within the specified time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4138"/>The <num value="2">two</num> manacled wretches thus saved their necks; but it is to be regretted that the execution did not come off; for some years afterward their devilish propensities led them into <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, where both engaged in the most horrible butcheries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4139"/>The <rs>Kiowas</rs> were now in our hands, and all the <name>Comanches</name> too, except <num value="1">one</num> small band, which, after the <name>Custer</name> fight, had fled toward the headwaters of the <placeName reg="Red River, Brown, Texas" key="tgn,2611953">Red River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4140"/>This party was made up of a lot of very bad Indians-outlaws from the main tribe-and we did not hope to <pb id="p.474" n="474"/> subdue them except by a fight, and of this they got their fill; for <persName n="Evans,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00474.05190" reg="nearbymention:Evans,A.,W.,,"><surname>Evans</surname></persName>, moving from <placeName key="possibilities=32" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Monument Creek</placeName> toward the western base of the <rs type="place">Witchita Mountains</rs> on <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas Day</occasion></dateStruct>, had the good fortune to strike their village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4141"/>In the snow and cold his approach was wholly unexpected, and he was thus enabled to deal the band a blow that practically annihilated it. <num value="25">Twenty-five</num> warriors were killed outright, most of the women and children captured, and all the property was destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4142"/>Only a few of the party escaped, and some of these made their way in to <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName>, to join the rest of their tribe in confinement; while others, later in the season, surrendered at <placeName reg="Fort Bascom">Fort Bascom</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4143"/>This sudden appearance of <persName n="Evans,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00474.05191" reg="nearbymention:Evans,A.,W.,,"><surname>Evans</surname></persName> in the <placeName reg="Red River, Brown, Texas" key="tgn,2611953">Red River</placeName> region also alarmed the <name>Cheyennes</name> and Arapahoes, and their thoughts now began to turn to submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4144"/>Food was growing scarce with them, too, as there was but little game to be found either in the <rs type="place">Witchita Mountains</rs> or on the edge of the <rs type="place">Staked Plains</rs>, and the march of <orgName n="column"><persName n="Carr,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00474.05192" reg="mostcommon:Carr,Gouverneur,,,:2"><surname>Carr</surname></persName>'s column</orgName> from <placeName reg="Antelope Hills, Roger Mills, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2134828">Antelope Hills</placeName> precluded their returning to where the buffalo ranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4145"/>Then, too, many of their ponies were dead or dying, most of their tepees and robes had been abandoned, and the women and children, having been kept constantly on the move in the winter's storms, were complaining bitterly of their sufferings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4146"/>In view of this state of things they intimated, through their <placeName key="tgn,2103388" n="1.000 2" reg="comanche, comanche, texas">Comanche</placeName>-<placeName reg="Apache, Caddo, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2082793">Apache</placeName> friends at <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName>, that they would like to make terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4147"/>On receiving their messages I entered into negotiations with Little Robe, chief of the <name>Cheyennes</name>, and Yellow Bear, chief of the <name>Arapahoes</name>, and despatched envoys to have both tribes understand clearly that they must recognize their subjugation by surrendering at once, and permanently settling on their reservations in the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4148"/>Of course the usual delays of <name>Indian</name> diplomacy ensued, and it was some weeks before I heard the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4149"/>Then <num value="1">one</num> of my messengers returned with word that Little Robe and Yellow Bear were on their way to see me. They arrived a few days later, and, promptly acceding to the terms, promised to bring their people in, but as many of them would have to come on foot on account of the condition of the ponies, more time was solicited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4150"/>Convinced of the sincerity of their professions I gave them a reasonable extension, and eventually Yellow Bear made good his word, but Little Robe, in spite of earnest and repeated efforts, was unable to deliver his people till further operations were begun against them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4151"/>While these negotiations were in progress I came to the conclusion that a permanent military post ought to be established well down on the <name>Kiowa</name> and <placeName key="tgn,2103388" n="1.000 2" reg="comanche, comanche, texas">Comanche</placeName> reservation, in order to keep an eye on these tribes in the future, <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName>, being an unsuitable location, because too far to the north to protect the <rs>Texas</rs> frontier, and too far away <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> from where it was intended to permanently place the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4152"/>With this purpose in view I had the country thoroughly explored, and afterward a place was fixed upon not far from the base of the <rs type="place">Witchita Mountains</rs>, and near the confluence of <placeName reg="Medicine Bluff">Medicine Bluff</placeName> and <persName n="Cash,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00475.05193" reg="mostcommon:Cash,nomatch:0"><surname>Cash</surname></persName> creeks, where building stone and timber could be obtained in plenty, and to this point I decided to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4153"/>The place was named <placeName reg="Camp Sill">Camp Sill</placeName>-now <placeName reg="Fort Sill, Comanche, Oklahoma" key="tgn,7017847">Fort Sill</placeName>-in honor of my classmate, <persName n="Sill,General,,,," id="n0035.0039.00475.05194" reg="mostcommon:Sill,Joshua,W.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sill</surname></persName>, killed at <placeName reg="Stones River, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2696868">Stone River</placeName>; and to make sure of the surrendered <rs>Indians</rs>, I required them all, Kiowas, Comanches, and <placeName key="tgn,2103388" n="1.000 2" reg="comanche, comanche, texas">Comanche</placeName>-Apaches, to accompany us to the new post, so they could be kept under military control till they were settled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4154"/>During the march to the new camp the weather was not so cold as that experienced in coming down from <placeName reg="Camp Supply">Camp Supply</placeName>; still, rains were frequent, and each was invariably followed by a depression of temperature and high winds, very destructive to our animals, much weakened by lack of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4155"/>The men fared pretty well, however, for on the rough march along the <rs>Washita</rs>, and during our stay at <placeName key="tgn,2083236" n="1.000 3" reg="fort cobb, caddo, oklahoma">Fort Cobb</placeName>, they had learned to protect themselves materially from the cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4156"/>For this they had contrived many devices, the favorite means being dugouts &mdash; that is, pits dug in the ground, and roofed over with shelter-tents, and having at <num value="1">one</num> end a fire-place and chimney ingeniously constructed with sod. In these they lived very snugly-<num value="4">four</num> men in each-and would often amuse themselves by poking their heads out and barking at the occupants of adjacent huts in imitation of the prairie-dog, whose comfortable nests had probably suggested the idea of dugouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4157"/>The men were much better off, in fact, than many of the officers, for the high winds frequently made havoc with our wall-tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4158"/>The horses and mules suffered most of all. They could not be sheltered, and having neither grain nor grass, the poor beasts were in no condition to stand the chilling blasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4159"/>Still, by cutting down cottonwood-trees, and letting the animals browse on the small soft branches, we managed to keep them up till, finally even this wretched food beginning to grow scarce, I had all except a few of the strongest sent to <placeName key="tgn,2083105" n="1.000 1" reg="Davis, Murray, Oklahoma">Fort Arbuckle</placeName>, near which place we had been able, fortunately, to purchase some fields of corn from the halfcivilized <rs>Chickasaws</rs> and <rs>Choctaws</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4160"/>Through mismanagement, as previously noted, the greater part of the supplies which I had ordered hauled to <persName n="Arbuckle,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00475.05195" reg="mostcommon:Arbuckle,nomatch:0"><surname>Arbuckle</surname></persName> the preceding fall had not got farther on the way than <placeName reg="Fort Gibson, Muskogee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,7013786">Fort Gibson</placeName>, which post was about <measure n="400miles" type="distance">four hundred miles</measure> off, and the road abominable, particularly east of <placeName key="tgn,2083105" n="1.000 1" reg="Davis, Murray, Oklahoma">Arbuckle</placeName>, where it ran through a low region called <quote>boggy bottom.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4161"/>All along this route were abandoned wagons, left sticking in the mud, and hence the transportation was growing so short that I began to fear trouble in getting subsistence up for the men. Still, it would not do to <pb id="p.476" n="476"/> withdraw, so I made a trip to <placeName key="tgn,2083105" n="1.000 1" reg="Davis, Murray, Oklahoma">Arbuckle</placeName> chiefly for the purpose of reorganizing the transportation, but also with a view to opening a new route to that post, the road to lie on high ground, so as to avoid the creeks and mud that had been giving us so much trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/>If such a road could be made, I hoped to get up enough rations and grain from the cornfields purchased to send out a formidable expedition against the <name>Cheyennes</name>, so I set out for <placeName key="tgn,2083105" n="1.000 1" reg="Davis, Murray, Oklahoma">Arbuckle</placeName> accompanied by my quartermaster, <persName n="McGonigle,Colonel,A.,J.,," id="n0035.0039.00476.05196" reg="default:McGonigle,A.,J.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>McGonigle</surname></persName>. <quote><placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName></quote> also went along to guide us through the scrub-oaks covering the ridge, but even the most thorough exploration failed to discover any route more practicable than that already in use; indeed, the high ground was, if anything, worse than the bottom land, our horses in the springy places and quicksands often miring to their knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4163"/>The ground was so soft and wet, in fact, that we had to make most of the way on foot, so by the time we reached <placeName key="tgn,2083105" n="1.000 1" reg="Davis, Murray, Oklahoma">Arbuckle</placeName> I was glad to abandon the new road project. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4164"/>Finding near <placeName key="tgn,2083105" n="1.000 1" reg="Davis, Murray, Oklahoma">Arbuckle</placeName> more fields of corn than those already purchased, I had them bought also, and ordered more of the horses back there to be fed. I next detected every available mule to be put to hauling rations, having discovered that the full capacity of the transportation had not yet been brought into play in forwarding stores from <persName n="Gibson,,,,," id="n0035.0039.00476.05197" reg="mostcommon:Gibson,Horatio,Gates,,:1"><surname>Gibson</surname></persName>, and with this regulation of the supply question I was ready to return immediately to <placeName reg="Camp Sill">Camp Sill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4165"/>But my departure was delayed by <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName>, who, notwithstanding the prohibitory laws of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, in some unaccountable way had got gloriously tipsy, which caused a loss of time that disgusted me greatly; but as we could not well do without <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName>, I put off starting till the next day, by which time it was thought he would sober up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4166"/>How he had managed to get the grog to keep up his spree was a mystery which we could not solve, though we had had him closely watched, so I cut the matter short by packing him into my ambulance and carrying him off to <placeName reg="Camp Sill">Camp Sill</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4168"/>The promised surrender of the <name>Cheyennes</name> was still uncertain of fulfillment, however, and although Little Robe and his family had remained with us in evidence of good faith, the messages he sent to his followers brought no assurance of the tribe's coming inthe runners invariably returning with requests for more time, and bringing the same old excuse of inability to move because the ponies were so badly off. But more time was just what I was determined not to grant, for I felt sure that if a surrender was not forced before the spring <pb id="p.477" n="477"/> grass came, the ponies would regain their strength, and then it would be doubtful if the <name>Cheyennes</name> came in at all. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4228"/>About noon I observed that the scouts in advance had left the trail and begun to reconnoitre a low ridge to their right, the sequel of which was that in a few minutes they returned to the wagons on a dead run and reported <placeName key="tgn,7014508" n="1.000 30" reg="sioux city, woodbury, iowa">Sioux</placeName> just ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4229"/>Looking in the direction indicated, I could dimly see <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> horsemen riding in a circle, as Indians do when giving warning to their camp, but as our halt disclosed that we were aware of their proximity, they darted back again behind the crest of the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4230"/>Anticipating from this move an immediate attack, we hastily prepared for it by unhooking the mules from the wagon and ambulance, so that we could use the vehicles as a barricade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4231"/>This done, I told the interpreter to take the <name>Mandan</name> scouts and go over toward the ridge and reconnoitre again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4232"/>As the scouts neared the crest <num value="2">two</num> of them dismounted, and, crawling slowly on their bellies to the summit, took a hasty look and returned at once to their horses, coming back with word that in the valley beyond was a camp of at least a <num value="100">hundred</num> <placeName key="tgn,7014508" n="1.000 30" reg="sioux city, woodbury, iowa">Sioux</placeName> lodges, and that the <name>Indians</name> were hurriedly getting ready to attack us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4234"/>To make the best of the situation, we unloaded the baggage, distributing and adjusting the trunks, rolls of bedding, crackerboxes, and everything else that would stop a bullet, in such manner as to form a square barricade, <num value="2">two</num> sides of which were the wagons, with the mules haltered to the wheels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4235"/>Every man then supplied himself with all the ammunition he could carry, and the <name>Mandan</name> scouts setting up the depressing wail of the <rs>Indian</rs> death-song, we all awaited the attack with the courage of despair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4236"/>But no attack came; and time slipping by, and we still unmolested, the interpreter and scouts were sent out to make another reconnoissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4237"/>Going through just such precautions as before in approaching the ridge, their slow progress kept us in painful suspense; but when they got to the crest the strain on our nerves was relieved by seeing them <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stand up boldly at full height, and then descend beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4238"/>Quickly returning, they brought welcome word that the whole thing was a mistake, and no <placeName key="tgn,7014508" n="1.000 30" reg="sioux city, woodbury, iowa">Sioux</placeName> were there at all. What had been taken for a <num value="100">hundred</num> <name>Indian</name> lodges turned out to be the camp of a Government train on its way to <placeName reg="Fort Stevenson">Fort Stevenson</placeName>, and the officer in charge seeing the scouts before they discovered him, and believing them to be <placeName key="tgn,7014508" n="1.000 30" reg="sioux city, woodbury, iowa">Sioux</placeName>, had sent out to bring his herds in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the <name>German</name> plan was simply to threaten with their right, while the corps of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Army advanced toward the north, to prevent the <rs>French</rs>, of whose intentions there was much doubt, from escaping toward <placeName key="tgn,2465007" n="1.000 10" reg="Logtown, Hancock, Mississippi">Chalons</placeName>; then, as the purposes of the <rs>French</rs> might be developed, these corps were to change direction toward the enemy successively, and seek to turn his right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>But the location of this vital turning-point was very uncertain, and until it was ascertained and carried, late in the afternoon, the action raged with more or less intensity along the entire line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>But as it is not my purpose to describe in detail the <rs n="Battle of Gravelotte" type="battle">battle of Gravelotte</rs>, nor any other, I will speak of some of its incidents merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/><pb id="p.493" n="493"/> About noon, after many preliminary skirmishes, the action was begun according to the plan I have already outlined, the <name>Germans</name> advancing their left while holding on strongly with their right, and it was this wing (the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Army) that came under my observation from the place where the <rs>King</rs>'s headquarters were located.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>From here we could see, as I have said, the village of <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Moselle, Lorraine" key="tgn,1033335">Gravelotte</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>Before it lay the <name>German</name> troops, concealed to some extent, especially to the left, by clumps of timber here and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>Immediately in front of us, however, the ground was open, and the day being clear and sunny, with a fresh breeze blowing (else the smoke from a battle between <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> men would have obstructed the view altogether), the spectacle presented was of unsurpassed magnificence and sublimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>The <orgName n="German Artillery" type="artillery">German artillery</orgName> opened the battle, and while the air was filled with shot and shell from hundreds of guns along their entire line, the <name>German</name> centre and left, in rather open order, moved out to the attack, and as they went forward the reserves, in close column, took up positions within supporting distances, yet far enough back to be out of range. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>The <orgName n="French Artillery" type="artillery">French artillery</orgName> and mitrailleuses responded vigorously to the <name>Krupps</name>, and with deadly effect, but as far as we could see the <name>German</name> left continued its advance, and staff-officers came up frequently to report that all was going on well at points hidden from our view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>These reports were always made to the <rs>King</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and whenever anybody arrived with tidings of the fight we clustered around to hear the news, <persName n="Moltke,General,,,,Von" id="n0035.0041.00493.05283" reg="nearbymention:Moltke,Von,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <nameLink>Von</nameLink> <surname>Moltke</surname></persName> unfolding a map meanwhile, and explaining the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>This done, the chief of the staff, while awaiting the next report, would either return to a seat that had been made for him with some knapsacks, or would occupy the time walking about, kicking clods of dirt or small stones here and there, his hands clasped behind his back, his face pale and thoughtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4311"/>He was then nearly <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> old, but because of his emaciated figure, the deep wrinkles in his face, and the crow's-feet about his eyes, he looked even older, his appearance being suggestive of the practice of church asceticisms rather than of his well-known ardent devotion to the military profession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>By the middle of the afternoon the steady progress of the <name>German</name> left and centre had driven the <rs>French</rs> from their more advanced positions from behind stone walls and hedges, through valleys and hamlets, in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7008418" n="1.000 1" reg="metz,moselle,lorraine,france,europe">Metz</placeName>, but as yet the <name>German</name> right had accomplished little except to get possession of the village of <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Moselle, Lorraine" key="tgn,1033335">Gravelotte</placeName>, forcing the <rs>French</rs> across the deep ravine I have mentioned, which runs <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> a little distance east of the town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>As the <name>Germans</name> moved to the attack here, the <rs>French</rs> fire became heavy and destructive, so much so, indeed, as to cause <persName n="Steinmetz,General,,,,Von" id="n0035.0041.00495.05285" reg="mostcommon:Steinmetz,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <nameLink>Von</nameLink> <surname>Steinmetz</surname></persName> to order some cavalry belonging to the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> to make a charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4315"/>Crossing the ravine before described, this body of horse swept up the slope beyond, the front ranks urged forward by the momentum from behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4316"/>The <rs>French</rs> were posted along a sunken road, behind stone walls and houses, and as the <name>German</name> cavalry neared these obstructions it received a dreadful fire without the least chance of returning it, though still pushed on till the front ranks were crowded into the deep cut of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/>Here the slaughter was terrible, for the horsemen could make no further headway; and because of the blockade behind, of dead and wounded men and animals, an orderly retreat was impossible, and disaster inevitable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4318"/>About the time the charge was ordered, the phase of the battle was such that the <rs>King</rs> concluded to move his headquarters into the village of <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Moselle, Lorraine" key="tgn,1033335">Gravelotte</placeName>; and just after getting there, we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> learned fully of the disastrous result of the charge which had been entered upon with such spirit; and so much indignation was expressed against <persName n="Steinmetz,,,,," id="n0035.0041.00495.05286" reg="mostcommon:Steinmetz,nomatch:0"><surname>Steinmetz</surname></persName>, who, it was claimed, had made an unnecessary sacrifice of his cavalry, that I thought he would be relieved on the spot; though this was not done. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>Followed by a large staff, <persName n="Steinmetz,General,,,," id="n0035.0041.00495.05287" reg="mostcommon:Steinmetz,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Steinmetz</surname></persName> appeared in the village presently, and approached the <rs>King</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>When near, he bowed with great respect, and I then saw that he was a very old man, though his soldierly figure, bronzed face, and short-cropped hair gave some evidence of vigor still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>When the <rs>King</rs> spoke to him I was not close enough to learn what was said; but <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty's</name> manner was expressive of kindly feeling, and the fact that in a few moments the veteran general returned to the command of his troops, indicated that, for the present at least, his fault had been overlooked. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>The <rs>King</rs> then moved out of the village, and just a little to the <name>east</name> and <name>north</name> of it the headquarters were located on high, open ground, whence we could observe the right of the <name>German</name> infantry advancing up the eastern face of the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>The advance, though slow and irregular, resulted in gradually gaining ground, the <rs>French</rs> resisting stoutly with a stubborn musketry fire all along the slopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>Their artillery was silent, however; and from this fact the <orgName n="German Artillery" type="artillery">German artillery</orgName> officers grew jubilant, confidently asserting that their <name type="weapon">Krupp guns</name> had dismounted the <rs>French</rs> batteries and knocked their mitrailleuses to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4325"/>I did not indulge in this confidence, however; for, with the excellent field-glass I had, I could distinctly see long columns of <name>French</name> troops moving to <pb id="p.496" n="496"/> their right, for the apparent purpose of making a vigorous fight on that flank; and I thought it more than likely that their artillery would be heard from before the <name>Germans</name> could gain the coveted ridge. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>The <rs>Germans</rs> labored up the glacis slowly at the most exposed places; now crawling on their bellies, now creeping on hands and knees, but, in the main, moving with erect and steady bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/>Resistance like this was so unexpected by the <name>Germans</name> that it dismayed them; and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wavering a moment, then becoming panic-stricken, they broke and fled, infantry, cavalry, and artillery coming down the slope without any pretence of formation, the <rs>French</rs> hotly following and pouring in a heavy and constant fire as the fugitives fled back across the ravine toward <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Moselle, Lorraine" key="tgn,1033335">Gravelotte</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>With this the battle on the right had now assumed a most serious aspect, and the indications were that the <rs>French</rs> would attack the heights of <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Moselle, Lorraine" key="tgn,1033335">Gravelotte</placeName>; but the <name>Pomeranian</name> corps coming on the field at this crisis, was led into action by <persName n="Moltke,,Von,,," id="n0035.0041.00496.05288" reg="default:Moltke,Von,,,"><foreName>Von</foreName> <surname>Moltke</surname></persName> himself, and shortly after the day was decided in favor of the <name>Germans</name>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4330"/>When the <rs>French</rs> guns opened fire, it was discovered that the <rs>King</rs>'s position was within easy range, many of the shells falling near enough to make the place extremely uncomfortable; so it was suggested that he go to a less exposed point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4331"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he refused to listen to this wise counsel, but yielded finally-leaving the ground with reluctance, however-and went back toward R6zonville.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/>The dressing down finished to his satisfaction, the <rs>King</rs> resumed his course toward R6zonville, halting, however, to rebuke in the same emphatic style every group of runaways he overtook. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>Passing through R6zonville, we halted just beyond the village; there a fire was built, and the <rs>King</rs>, his brother, <persName n="Charles,Prince,Frederick,,," id="n0035.0041.00496.05290" reg="default:Charles,Frederick,,,"><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Roon,,Von,,," id="n0035.0041.00496.05291" reg="default:Roon,Von,,,"><foreName>Von</foreName> <surname>Roon</surname></persName> were provided with rather uncomfortable seats about it, made by resting the ends of a short ladder on a couple of boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>With much anxiety and not a little depression of spirits news from the battle-field was now awaited, but the suspense did not last long, for presently <pb id="p.497" n="497"/> came the cheering intelligence that the <rs>French</rs> were retiring, being forced back by the <name>Pomeranian</name> corps, and some of the lately broken <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> organizations, that had been rallied on the heights of <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Moselle, Lorraine" key="tgn,1033335">Gravelotte</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>During the excitement of the day I had not much felt the want of either food or water, but now that all was over I was nearly exhausted, having had neither since early morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/>Indeed, all of the party were in like straits; the immense armies had not only eaten up nearly everything in the country, but had drunk all the wells dry, too, and there seemed no relief for us till, luckily, a squad of soldiers came along the road with a small cask of wine in a cart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/><num value="1">One</num> of the staff-officers instantly appropriated the keg, and proceeded to share his prize most generously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/>Never had I tasted anything so refreshing and delicious, but as the wine was the ordinary sour stuff drunk by the peasantry of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> France</placeName>, my appreciation must be ascribed to my famished condition rather than to any virtues of the beverage itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>After I had thus quenched my thirst the <rs>King</rs>'s brother called me aside, and drawing from his coat-tail pocket a piece of stale black bread, divided it with me, and while munching on this the <rs>Prince</rs> began talking of his son-<persName n="Charles,General,Prince,Frederick,," id="n0035.0041.00497.05293" reg="default:Charles,Prince,Frederick,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Prince</foreName> <foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName>, popularly called the <rs>Red Prince</rs> &mdash; who was in command of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Army in this battle-the <name>German</name> <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>In recounting his son's professional career the old man's face was aglow with enthusiasm, and not without good cause, for in the war between <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>, as well as in the present campaign, the <rs>Red Prince</rs> had displayed the highest order of military genius. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4344"/>The headquarters now became the scene of much bustle, despatches announcing the victory being sent in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4345"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> transmitted was to the <rs>Queen</rs>, the <rs>King</rs> directing <persName n="Bismarck,Comte,,,," id="n0035.0041.00497.05294" reg="mostcommon:Bismarck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Bismarck</surname></persName> to prepare it for his signature; then followed others of a more official character, and while these matters were being attended to I thought I would ride into the village to find, if possible, some water for my horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>Just as I entered the chief street, however, I was suddenly halted by a squad of soldiers, who, taking me for a French officer (my coat and forage cap resembling those of the <rs>French</rs>), leveled their pieces at me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>Fortunately a few disconnected <name>German</name> words came to me in the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>With these <pb id="p.498" n="498"/> I managed to delay my execution, and <num value="1">one</num> of the party ventured to come up to examine the <quote>suspect</quote> more closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4349"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing he did was to take off my cap, and looking it over carefully, his eyes rested on the <num value="3">three</num> stars above the visor, and, pointing to them, he emphatically pronounced me <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0035.0041.00498.05298" reg="mostcommon:French,Winsor,B.,,:3"><surname>French</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4350"/>Then of course they all became excited again, more so than before, even, for they thought I was trying to practice a ruse, and I question whether I should have lived to recount the adventure had not an officer belonging to the <rs>King</rs>'s headquarters been passing by just then, when, hearing the threatenings and imprecations, he rode up to learn the cause of the hubbub, and immediately recognized and released me. When he told my wrathy captors who I was, they were much mortified of course, and made the most profuse apologies, promising that no such mistake should occur again, and so on; but not feeling wholly reassured, for my uniform was still liable to mislead, I was careful to return to headquarters in company with my deliverer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4351"/>There I related what had occurred, and after a good laugh all round, the <rs>King</rs> provided me with a pass which he said would preclude any such mishap in the future, and would also permit me to go wherever I pleased &mdash; a favor rarely bestowed. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>While I was absent, as related in the preceding chapter, it had been decided that the <rs>King</rs>'s quarters should be established for the night in the village of <placeName reg="Rezonville,Moselle,Lorraine,France,Europe" key="tgn,4009219">Rezonville</placeName>; and as it would be very difficult, at such a late hour, to billet the whole party regularly, <persName n="Bismarck,Comte,,,," id="n0035.0042.00499.05299" reg="mostcommon:Bismarck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Bismarck</surname></persName> and I went off to look for shelter for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4354"/>Remembering that I had seen, when seeking to water my horse, a partly burned barn with some freshlooking hay in it, I suggested that we lodge there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4355"/>He too thought it would answer our purpose, but on reaching it we found the unburned part of the barn filled with wounded, and this necessitating a further search we continued on through the village in quest of some house not yet converted into a hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4356"/>Such, however, seemed impossible to come upon, so at last the <rs>Count</rs> fixed on <num value="1">one</num> whose upper floor, we learned, was unoccupied, though the lower <num value="1">one</num> was covered with wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4357"/>Mounting a creaky ladder &mdash; there was no stairway &mdash; to the upper story, we found a good-sized room with <num value="3">three</num> large beds, <num value="1">one</num> of which the <rs>Chancellor</rs> assigned to the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7014021" n="1.000 1" reg="mecklenburg, north carolina, united states">Mecklenburg</placeName> and aide, and another to <persName n="Bismarck,Comte,,,," id="n0035.0042.00499.05300" reg="mostcommon:Bismarck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Bismarck</surname></persName>-<persName n="Bohlen,,,,," id="n0035.0042.00499.05301" reg="mostcommon:Bohlen,nomatch:0"><surname>Bohlen</surname></persName> and me, reserving the remaining <num value="1">one</num> for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4358"/>Each bed, as is common in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> France</placeName>, was provided with a feather tick, but the night being warm, these spreads were thrown off, and discovering that they would make a comfortable shakedown on the floor, I slept there leaving <persName n="Bismarck,,,,," id="n0035.0042.00499.05302" reg="mostcommon:Bismarck,nomatch:0"><surname>Bismarck</surname></persName>-<persName n="Bohlen,,,,," id="n0035.0042.00499.05303" reg="mostcommon:Bohlen,nomatch:0"><surname>Bohlen</surname></persName> unembarrassed by companionship-at least of a human kind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4359"/>At daylight I awoke, and seeing that <persName n="Bismarck,Comte,,,," id="n0035.0042.00499.05304" reg="mostcommon:Bismarck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Bismarck</surname></persName> was already dressed and about to go down the ladder, I felt obliged to follow his <pb id="p.500" n="500"/> example, so I too turned out, and shortly descended to the ground-floor, the only delays of the toilet being those incident to dressing, for there were no conveniences for morning ablutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4360"/>Just outside the door I met the <rs>Count</rs>, who, proudly exhibiting a couple of eggs he had bought from the woman of the house, invited me to breakfast with him, provided we could beg some coffee from the king's escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/>Putting the eggs under my charge, with many injunctions as to their safe-keeping, he went off to forage for the coffee, and presently returned, having been moderately successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/>Indeed, it seemed only to whet the appetite, and we both set out on an eager expedition for more food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4364"/>Before going far I had the good luck to meet a sutler's wagon, and though its stock was about all sold, there were still left <num value="4">four</num> large bologna sausages, which I promptly purchasedpaying a round sum for them too-and hastening back found the <rs>Count</rs> already returned, though without bringing anything at all to eat; but he had secured a couple of bottles of brandy, and with a little of this-it was excellent, too-and the sausages, the slim ration of eggs and coffee was amply reinforced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4365"/>Breakfast over, the <rs>Chancellor</rs> invited me to accompany him in a ride to the battle-field, and I gladly accepted, as I very much desired to pass over the ground in front of <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Cheatham, Tennessee" key="tgn,2361449">Gravelotte</placeName>, particularly so to see whether the <name>Krupp</name> guns had really done the execution that was claimed for them by the <orgName n="German Artillery" type="artillery">German artillery</orgName> officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4366"/>Going directly through the village of <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Cheatham, Tennessee" key="tgn,2361449">Gravelotte</placeName>, following the causeway over which the <name>German</name> cavalry had passed to make its courageous but futile charge, we soon reached the ground where the fighting had been the most severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4367"/>Here the field was literally covered with evidences of the terrible strife, the dead and wounded strewn thick on every side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4368"/>In the sunken road the carnage had been awful; men and horses having been slaughtered there by hundreds, helpless before the murderous fire delivered from behind a high stone wall impracticable to mounted troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4369"/>The sight was sickening to an extreme, and we were not slow to direct our course elsewhere, going up the glacis toward the <rs>French</rs> line, the open ground over which we crossed being covered with <num value="1000">thousands</num> of helmets, that had been thrown off by the <name>Germans</name> during the fight and were still dotting the field, though details of soldiers from the organizations which had been engaged here were about to begin to gather up their abandoned headgear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>When we got inside the <rs>French</rs> works, I was astonished to observe how little harm had been done the defenses by the <orgName n="German Artillery" type="artillery">German artillery</orgName>, <pb id="p.501" n="501"/> for although I had not that serene faith in the effectiveness of their guns held by <name>German</name> artillerists generally, yet I thought their terrific cannonade must have left marked results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>All I could perceive, however, was a disabled gun, a broken mitrailleuse, and <num value="2">two</num> badly damaged caissons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>Everything else, except a little ammunition in the trenches, had been carried away, and it was plain to see, from the good shape in which the <rs>French</rs> <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> had retired to <placeName key="tgn,7008418" n="1.000 1" reg="metz,moselle,lorraine,france,europe">Metz</placeName>, that its retreat had been predetermined by the disasters to the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>By this hour the <name>German</name> cavalry having been thrown out to the front well over toward <placeName key="tgn,7008418" n="1.000 1" reg="metz,moselle,lorraine,france,europe">Metz</placeName>, we, following it to get a look at the city, rode to a neighboring summit, supposing it would be a safe point of observation; but we shortly realized the contrary, for scarcely had we reached the crest when some of the <rs>French</rs> pickets, lying concealed about <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> off, opened fire, making it so very hot for us that, hugging the necks of our horses, we incontinently fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>Observing what had taken place, a troop of <name>German</name> cavalry charged the <rs>French</rs> outpost and drove it far enough away to make safe our return, and we resumed possession of the point, but only to discover that the country to the east was so broken and hilly that no satisfactory view of <placeName key="tgn,7008418" n="1.000 1" reg="metz,moselle,lorraine,france,europe">Metz</placeName> could be had. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>Returning to <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Moselle, Lorraine" key="tgn,1033335">Gravelotte</placeName>, we next visited that part of the battle-field to the northeast of the village, and before long <persName n="Bismarck,Comte,,,," id="n0035.0042.00501.05305" reg="mostcommon:Bismarck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Bismarck</surname></persName> discovered in a remote place about <num value="20">twenty</num> men dreadfully wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4552"/>The march of these armies had been unobstructed by any resistance worth mentioning, and as the routes of both columns lay through a region teeming with everything necessary for their support, and rich even in luxuries, it struck me that such campaigning was more a vast picnic than like actual war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4554"/>Almost every foot of the way was strewn with fragments of glass from wine bottles, emptied and then broken by the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>There was, indeed, so much of this that I refrain from making any estimate of the number of bottles, lest I be thought to exaggerate, but the road was literally paved with glass, and the amount of wine consumed (none was wasted) must have been enormous, far more, even, than I had seen evidence of at any time before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> almost continuous lines of broken bottles along the roadsides all the way down from <placeName key="tgn,7009674" n="1.000 2" reg="sedan,ardennes,champagne-ardenne,france,europe">Sedan</placeName>; but that exhibit was small compared with what we saw about Brie. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>At Brie we were taken charge of by the <name>German</name> commandant of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>He entertained us most hospitably for an hour or so, and then, accompanied by a lieutenant, who was to be our guide, I set out <pb id="p.521" n="521"/> ahead of my companions to gain a point on the picket-line where I expected to get a good look at the <rs>French</rs>, for their rifle-pits were but a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> off across the <name>Marne</name>, their main line being just behind the rifle-pits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/>As the lieutenant and I rode through the village, some soldiers warned us that the adventure would be dangerous, but that we could probably get to the desired place unhurt if we avoided the <rs>French</rs> fire by forcing our horses to a run in crossing some open streets where we would be exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>On getting to the first street my guide galloped ahead to show the way, and as the <rs>French</rs> were not on the lookout for anything of the kind at these dangerous points, only a few stray shots were drawn by the lieutenant, but when I followed, they were fully up to what was going on, and let fly a volley every time they saw me in the open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4561"/>Fortunately, however, in their excitement they overshot, but when I drew rein alongside of my guide under protection of the bluff where the <name>German</name> picket was posted, my hair was all on end, and I was about as badly scared as ever I had been in my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/>As soon as I could recover myself I thought of <persName n="Havelock,,,,," id="n0035.0044.00521.05424" reg="nearbymention:Havelock,Henry,,,"><surname>Havelock</surname></persName> and <persName n="Forsyth,,,,," id="n0035.0044.00521.05425" reg="mostcommon:Forsyth,James,W.,,:6"><surname>Forsyth</surname></persName>, with the hope that they would not follow; nor did they, for having witnessed my experience, they wisely concluded that, after all, they did not care so much to see the <rs>French</rs> rifle-pits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>When I had climbed to the top of the bluff I was much disappointed, for I could see but little-only the advanced rifle-pits across the river, and <placeName reg="Fort Nogent">Fort Nogent</placeName> beyond them, not enough, certainly, to repay a non-combatant for taking the risk of being killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4564"/>The next question was to return, and deciding to take no more such chances as those we had run in coming out, I said we would wait till dark, but this proved unnecessary, for to my utter astonishment my guide informed me that there was a perfectly safe route by which we might go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4565"/>I asked why we had not taken it in coming, and he replied that he had thought it <quote>too long and circuitous.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4566"/>To this I could say nothing, but I concluded that that was not quite the correct reason; the truth is that early that morning the young fellow had been helping to empty some of the many wine bottles I saw around Brie, and consequently had a little more <quote><placeName reg="Dutch, Braxton, West Virginia" key="tgn,2302045">Dutch</placeName> courage</quote> --was a little more rash-than would have been the case under other conditions. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4569"/>After this mishap, which luckily resulted in no harm, I hoped <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> would give up the amusement, but by failure becoming only the more determined, in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> effort he cleared the wall handsomely and rode across-country to the villages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4570"/>Following the road till it passed under a railway bridge, I there thought I saw a chance to gain <placeName key="tgn,1093761" n="1.000 1" reg="villiers,free state,south africa,africa">Villiers</placeName> by a short cut, and changing my course accordingly, I struck into a large vineyard to the left, and proceeding a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> through the vines, came suddenly upon a German picket-post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4571"/>The guard immediately leveled their rifles at me, when, remembering my R6zonville experience of being taken for a French officer because of my uniform, I hastily flung myself from the saddle in token of surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4610"/>As the carriages passed along in review, every now and then an occupant, unable or unwilling to repress her natural promptings, would indulge in a mild flirtation, making overtures by casting demure side-glances, throwing us coquettish kisses, or waving strings of amber beads with significant gestures, seeming to say: <quote>why don't you follow?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4618"/>After the review we attended a grand military dinner given by the <rs>Grand Vizier</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>At the hour set for this banquet we presented ourselves at the palace of the <rs>Grand Vizier</rs>, and being ushered into a large drawing-room, found already assembled there the guests invited to meet us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>Just before the dinner was announced, all the <name>Turkish</name> officers went into an adjoining room, and turning their faces to the east, prostrated themselves to the floor in prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>Then we were all conducted to a large salon, where each being provided with a silver ewer and basin, a little ball of highly perfumed soap and a napkin, set out on small tables, each guest washed his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>Adjacent to this salon was the dining-room, or, rather, the banqueting room, a very large and artistically frescoed hall, in the centre of which stood a crescent-shaped table, lighted with beautiful silver candelabra, and tastefully decorated with flowers and fruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>The viands were all excellent; cooked, evidently, by a French <hi rend="italics">chef</hi> and full justice was done the dishes, especially by the <name>Turks</name>, who, of course, had been fasting all day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>At the close of the banquet, which consisted of not less than <num value="15">fifteen</num> courses, we withdrew to a smoking-room, where the coffee was served and cigarettes and chibouks offered us &mdash; the latter a pipe having a long flexible stem with an amber mouthpiece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>I chose the chibouk, and as the stem of mine was studded with precious stones of enormous value, I thought I should enjoy it the more; but the tobacco being highly flavored with some sort of herbs, my smoke fell far short of my anticipations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>The coffee was delicious, however, and I found this to be the case wherever I went in <placeName key="tgn,7002473" n="1.000 10" reg="Istanbul,Istanbul,Marmara,Turkiye,Asia">Constantinople</placeName>, whether in making calls or at dinner, the custom of offering coffee and tobacco on these occasions being universal. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>I said good-bye to <persName n="Bismarck,Comte,,,," id="n0035.0045.00532.05478" reg="mostcommon:Bismarck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Bismarck</surname></persName>, also, for at that busy time the chances of seeing him again were very remote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>The great <rs>Chancellor</rs> manifested more joy over the success of the <name>Germans</name> than did anyone else at the <rs>Imperial</rs> headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>Along with his towering strength of mind and body, his character partook of much of the enthusiasm and impulsiveness commonly restricted to younger men, and now in his frank, free way he plainly showed his light-heartedness and gratification at success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>That which for years his genius had been planning and striving for-permanent unification of the <rs>German States</rs>, had been accomplished by the war. It had welded them together in a compact Empire which no power in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> could disrupt, and as such a union was the aim of <persName n="Bismarck,,,,," id="n0035.0045.00532.05479" reg="mostcommon:Bismarck,nomatch:0"><surname>Bismarck</surname></persName>'s life, he surely had a right to feel jubilant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>Thanks to the courtesies extended me, I had been able to observe the principal battles, and study many of the minor details of a war between <num value="2">two</num> of the greatest military nations of the world, and to examine critically the methods followed abroad for subsisting, equipping, and maneuvering vast bodies of men during a stupendous campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>Of course <pb id="p.533" n="533"/> I found a great deal to interest and instruct me, yet nowadays war is pretty much the same everywhere, and this <num value="1">one</num> offered no marked exception to my previous experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>The methods pursued on the march were the same as we would employ, with <num value="1">one</num> most important exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>Owing to the density of population throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> it was always practicable for the <name>Germans</name> to quarter their troops in villages, requiring the inhabitants to subsist both officers and men. Hence there was no necessity for camp and garrison equipage, nor enormous provision trains, and the armies were unencumbered by these impedimenta, indispensable when operating in a poor and sparsely settled country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>As I have said before, the only trains were those for ammunition, pontoonboats, and the field telegraph, and all these were managed by special corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>If transportation was needed for other purposes, it was obtained by requisition from the invaded country, just as food and forage were secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>Great celerity of combination was therefore possible, the columns moving in compact order, and as all the roads were broad and macadamized, there was little or nothing to delay or obstruct the march of the <name>Germans</name>, except when their enemy offered resistance, but even this was generally slight and not very frequent, for the <rs>French</rs> were discouraged by disaster from the very outset of the campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>The earlier advantages gained by the <name>Germans</name> may be ascribed to the strikingly prompt mobilization of their armies, <num value="1">one</num> of the most noticeable features of their perfect military system, devised by almost autocratic power; their later successes were greatly aided by the blunders of the <rs>French</rs>, whose stupendous errors materially shortened the war, though even if prolonged it could, in my opinion, have had ultimately no other termination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>As I have previously stated, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these blunders was the acceptance of battle by <persName n="MacMahon,,,,," id="n0035.0045.00533.05480" reg="mostcommon:MacMahon,nomatch:0"><surname>MacMahon</surname></persName> at Worth; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in attaching too much importance to the fortified position of <placeName key="tgn,7008418" n="1.000 1" reg="metz,moselle,lorraine,france,europe">Metz</placeName>, resulting in <num value="3">three</num> battles-Colombey, Mars-la-Tour, and Gravelotte-all of which were lost; and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, the absurd movement of <persName n="MacMahon,,,,," id="n0035.0045.00533.05481" reg="mostcommon:MacMahon,nomatch:0"><surname>MacMahon</surname></persName> along the <name>Belgian</name> frontier to relieve <persName n="Metz,,,,," id="n0035.0045.00533.05482" reg="mostcommon:Metz,nomatch:0"><surname>Metz</surname></persName>, the responsibility for which, I am glad to say, does not belong to him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>With the hemming in of <persName n="Bazaine,,,,," id="n0035.0045.00533.05483" reg="mostcommon:Bazaine,nomatch:0"><surname>Bazaine</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7008418" n="1.000 1" reg="metz,moselle,lorraine,france,europe">Metz</placeName> and the capture of <orgName n="army"><persName n="MacMahon,,,,," id="n0035.0045.00533.05484" reg="mostcommon:MacMahon,nomatch:0"><surname>MacMahon</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7009674" n="1.000 2" reg="sedan,ardennes,champagne-ardenne,france,europe">Sedan</placeName> the crisis of the war was passed, and the <name>Germans</name> practically the victors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>The taking of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> was but a sentiment-the money levy could have been made and the <rs>Rhine</rs> provinces held without molesting that city, and only the political influences consequent upon the changes in the <rs>French Government</rs> caused peace to be deferred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>I did not have much opportunity to observe the <name>German</name> cavalry, either on the march or in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4707"/>The only time I saw any of it engaged <pb id="p.534" n="534"/> was in the unfortunate charge at <placeName reg="Gravelotte, Moselle, Lorraine" key="tgn,1033335">Gravelotte</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>That proved its mettle good and discipline fair, but answered no other purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>Such of it as was not attached to the infantry was organized in divisions, and operated in accordance with the old idea of covering the front and flanks of the army, a duty which it thoroughly performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>But thus directed it was in no sense an independent corps, and hence cannot be said to have accomplished anything in the campaign, or have had a weight or influence at all proportionate to its strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>The method of its employment seemed to me a mistake, for, being numerically superior to the <rs>French</rs> cavalry, had it been massed and maneuvered independently of the infantry, it could easily have broken up the <rs>French</rs> communications, and done much other work of weighty influence in the prosecution of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4712"/>The infantry was as fine as I ever saw, the men young and hardy in appearance, and marching always with an elastic stride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>The infantry regiment, however, I thought too large-too many men for a colonel to command unless he has the staff of a general-but this objection may be counterbalanced by the advantages resulting from associating together thus intimately the men from the same district, or county as we would call it; the celerity of mobilization, and, in truth, the very foundation of the <name>German</name> system, being based on this local or territorial scheme of recruiting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>There was no delay when the call sounded for the march; all turned out promptly, and while on the road there was very little straggling, only the sick falling out. But on such fine, smooth roads, and with success animating the men from the day they struck the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow, it could hardly be expected that the columns would not keep well closed up. Then, too, it must be borne in mind that, as already stated, campaigning in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> &mdash; that is, the marching, camping, and subsisting of an army-is an easy matter, very unlike anything we had during the war of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>To repeat: the country is rich, beautiful, and densely populated, subsistence abundant, and the roads all macadamized highways; thus the conditions are altogether different from those existing with us. I think that under the same circumstances our troops would have done as well as the <name>Germans</name>, marched as admirably, made combinations as quickly and accurately, and fought with as much success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>I can but leave to conjecture how the <name>Germans</name> would have got along on bottomless roadsoften none at all-through the swamps and quicksands of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, from the <rs>Wilderness</rs> to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and the sea. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>Following the operations of the <name>German</name> armies from the <rs n="Battle of Gravelotte" type="battle">battle of Gravelotte</rs> to the siege of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, I may, in conclusion, say that I saw no <pb id="p.535" n="535"/> new military principles developed, whether of strategy or grand tactics, the movements of the different armies and corps being dictated and governed by the same general laws that have so long obtained, simplicity of combination and maneuver, and the concentration of a numerically superior force at the vital point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/>After my brief trip to <placeName reg="Versailles, Yvelines, Ile-de-France" key="tgn,7008070">Versailles</placeName>, I remained in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> till the latter part of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>In company with <persName n="Washburn,Mister,,,," id="n0035.0045.00535.05485" reg="mostcommon:Washburn,Elihu,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Washburn</surname></persName>, I visited the fortifications for the defense of the city, and found them to be exceptionally heavy; so strong, indeed, that it would have been very hard to carry the place by a <orgName n="General Assault" type="misc">general assault</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/>The <rs>Germans</rs>, knowing the character of the works, had refrained from the sacrifice of life that such an attempt must entail, though they well knew that many of the forts were manned by unseasoned soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>With only a combat here and there, to tighten their lines or repulse a sortie, they wisely preferred to wait till starvation should do the work with little loss and absolute certainty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4722"/>The <rs>Germans</rs> were withdrawn from <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-03-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and no sooner were they gone than factional quarrels, which had been going on at intervals ever since the flight of the <rs>Empress</rs> and the fall of her regency on the <dateStruct value="-09-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, were renewed with revolutionary methods that eventually brought about the <name>Commune</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>Having witnessed <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of these outbreaks, and concluding that while such turbulence reigned in the city it would be of little profit for me to tarry there, I decided to devote the rest of the time I could be away from home to travel in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4724"/>My journeys through those countries were full of pleasure and instruction, but as nothing I saw or did was markedly different from what has been so often described by others, I will save the reader this part of my experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4725"/>I returned to <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> in the fall, having been absent a little more than a year, and although I saw much abroad of absorbing interest, both professional and general, yet I came back to my native land with even a greater love for her, and with increased admiration for her institutions.</p>
