<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>What is in some ways the most remarkable and significant feature of the <rs>American Civil War</rs> is generally overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Many another struggle has been rendered glorious by daring charges upon the ramparts of the foe; other armies and captains have inscribed upon their banners victories as brilliant as <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName> or <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>; other nations have poured out treasures of gold and blood in maintaining some right held sacred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>But it has remained for the <rs>American</rs> people to present the spectacle of a fierce fratricidal conflict, prolonged to the point of exhaustion, swiftly followed by an even firmer knitting of the ties of brotherhood than had prevailed before the joining of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In a word, the <rs>Civil War</rs>, though stubbornly waged, was in many respects the most generous civil conflict of modern times.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Even in the midst of the strife, commanders on either side were frank to recognize the sterling qualities of their opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>This eulogy, to be sure, is not couched in conventional terms, but that does not lessen its sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In the following year, the unrelenting <rs>Sherman</rs> wrote to his wife concerning the people of the <rs>South</rs>: <q direct="unspecified">No amount of poverty or adversity seems to shake their faith: niggers gone, wealth and luxury gone, money worthless, starvation in view within a period of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, and causes enough to make the bravest tremble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Yet I see no signs of let-up&mdash;some few deserters, plenty tired of war, but the masses determined to fight it out.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Her pastor, who was in the party, suggested that she invent better words for the tune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>That night the inspiration came; she wrote the best known of her poems and <num value="1">one</num> of the finest products of the whole Civil War period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Her later life was devoted largely to the cause of woman suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It represented the temper of a whole people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But no confiscations of conquered territory, no execution of prominent leaders ensued upon the downfall of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Reconstruction, it is true, was accompanied by a plundering of the already wrecked Southern resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But this was not so much the result of malice or political vindictiveness as of the wave of corruption that was then inundating the <name>Nation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The people of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> during the same decade were contributing some <measure n="70000000dollars" type="currency">seventy million dollars</measure> to support the leadership of <q direct="unspecified">Boss</q> <persName n="Tweed,,,,," id="n0114.0001.00018.00005" reg="mostcommon:Tweed,nomatch:0"><surname>Tweed</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Whatever bitterness post-bellum politics did arouse in the <rs>South</rs> has proved transitory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Since that unhappy period there has been a continually deepening sense of nationality, accompanied by a constant fading of sectional antagonism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It must not be supposed, however, that the literature of the <rs>Civil War</rs> invariably expresses a spirit of brotherhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>During the conflict itself there was a ceaseless effusion of poetry and eloquence which served an exactly opposite purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>A favorite method of instilling troops with patriotism was to proclaim loudly the cowardice of their opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>There were also gleeful threats of suspending conspicuous leaders from sour-apple trees and malicious attributing of wholesale mendacity to the <rs>Presidents</rs> of the opposing Governments.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He became indifferent to his poetical work, and it was owing to the insistence of his friend, <persName n="Shepherd,Miss,Lillian,McGregor,," id="n0114.0001.00019.00011" reg="default:Shepherd,Lillian,McGregor,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Lillian</foreName> <foreName>McGregor</foreName> <surname>Shepherd</surname></persName>, that his verse was collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Whether this request was the determining factor in the award for literary excellence is not recorded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Such publishing activity, however, had little influence on the life of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The songs about the camp-fire were started by some comrade with a strong voice and a good memory who had returned from furlough, and were taken up by less musical members of the squad and repeated on the march or in bivouac, until words and music became an unforgetable personal possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Most of the noteworthy poems, however, were inspired by stirring or pathetic incidents of the conflict&mdash;by the fall of some leader in the thick of the fight, by the dash of troops into the jaws of death, by the musings of a lonely private in faithful discharge of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It is well that such poems should live into these piping times of peace to keep fresh the remembrance of American heroism on whatever field displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Those greater incidents known as battles have been made the subject of numerous poetic efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Virtually every important battle and many a minor engagement were seized upon by the chroniclers in verse.

To the left are the remains of the humbler cottage. In the background are the woods where many a picnic made the days pass happily. The life of ease and quiet among these Arcadian surroundings was rudely ended by grim war. The hamlet lay in the path of a conquering army and was soon a waste place.
