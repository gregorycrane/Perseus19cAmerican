<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In all the toils and exposures of his military life, in sickly climes and at sickly seasons, he has preserved uninterrupted good health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>could to-day discharge with ease the duties of a common soldier in any arm of the service; and in the shock of encountering steel, few men would be more formidable, whether on horseback or on foot.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName> the country is either flat or slightly rolling, the soil improving as you approach the <name>Niemen</name>, but in many places very poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>There are no towns of any consequence on the road, which, you will observe, passes near the <name>Prussian</name> frontier, but many villages, which are generally of wood and presenting a dirty, squalid appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The villages are mostly inhabited by Jews,--as dirty and wretched a race as you ever saw,--worse than any <hi rend="italics">you</hi> ever saw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>It is difficult to imagine how they ever fought as they have done in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Ostrolinha was the site of a great battle in the revolution of <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>It is a small wooden town on the <name>Narew</name> (<hi rend="italics">Nareff</hi>), which is here a rapid stream some <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>A large monument commemorates the victory gained by the <name>Russians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Kouno is a town of good size, mostly built of plastered brick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>A portion of it is very old, while the new suburbs <pb id="p.64" n="64"/>are handsome and well built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>It presents the appearance of a flourishing place, there being many small vessels in the <name>Niemen</name>, and immense trains of carts constantly arviving here from the interior of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>They bring down tallow, hemp, &amp;c., and carry back cotton, groceries, &amp;c. As the <name>Niemen</name> empties in <placeName reg="Prussian territory">Prussian territory</placeName>, a glance at the map will show you the importance of this place whilst the <rs>Russian</rs> ports are blockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The <rs>Niemen</rs> is here <measure n="220yards" type="distance">two hundred and twenty yards</measure> wide,--a bold and rapid stream, crossed by a raft-bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>It was near and at this place that the great mass of the <rs>French</rs> army crossed the <name>Niemen</name> in <dateStruct value="1812-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>; and it was at the gate of this same town that in the retreat <persName n="Ney,Marshal,,,," id="n0065.0003.00064.00257" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Ney</surname></persName> fought so desperately, forming in his own person the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName> of the <rs>Grand Army</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Of course I went to the spot during the short time we remained here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>You now enter the great forests of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>As far as Vilkomir there is but little cultivation, the country being mostly covered by pine and beech forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>I should have mentioned that in the public square of Kouno there is a huge iron monument, bearing in <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> an inscription to the effect that out of <num value="700000">seven hundred thousand</num> French who crossed the <name>Niemen</name> in <hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="1812-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>,</hi> but <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> recrossed in <hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct></hi>. As far as Dunaburg (on the river <hi rend="italics">Duna</hi>, or, as some of the maps have it, <hi rend="italics">Dwina</hi>) the country is quite rolling,--almost broken; very different from the idea I had formed of it. You pass through a number of small towns and villages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Dunaburg appears to be a small town, presenting nothing of peculiar interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>There are some defensive works here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/> Before reaching Dunaburg, we passed through <num value="1">one</num> town (a small <num value="1">one</num>, perhaps hardly deserving the name of more than a village), called Novo Alexandrowsky, which is remarkably pretty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>It is situated on the high banks of a large and handsome lake broken by little green islets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>The houses and people were remarkably good-looking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/><pb id="p.65" n="65"/>Rigitza is also a pretty little place: there is hero a ruined castle of long, long ago. Country now not so much rolling as near Dunaburg, but still by no means flat: it is fertile and well cultivated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Ostroff is another handsome little place: the road here crosses the river on a very fine suspension-bridge; and on an island in the river is a very extensive ruined castle, perhaps of some of the <rs>Teutonic</rs> knights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Pscov, near which we passed, seems to be especially blessed with churches, the gilded domes of which shone from afar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The country near here, and, in fact, from here to <placeName reg="Sankt-Peterburg, Sankt-Peterburg, Rossiya" key="tgn,7010273">St. Petersburg</placeName>, is low and level, the soil generally good,--sometimes poor, and sometimes very fertile.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/> Pscov is the capital of a province, and at the head of a large lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Near Ploosa is a swampy district of considerable extent, and many large lakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>Nothing of very great interest until <num value="1">one</num> reaches Gatchina, where is the hunting-palace of the <rs>Emperor</rs>: it seems to be a very grand establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>From there to this city the country is very flat, the soil not very good, but settlements increasing as you draw near.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/> The general appearance of the portion of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> I have seen is much superior to Chat of <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>; and I like the appearance of the people very much.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The road from <placeName reg="Wassaw Sound, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2752661">Warsaw</placeName> here is truly a magnificent <num value="1">one</num>,--especially the portion of it in <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>It is all macadamized; and they are now hard at work <hi rend="italics">improving</hi> the <rs>Russian</rs> part, so that in a couple of months it will be throughout as fine a road, as any in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>Think of <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>the immense length,--<num value="1074">one thousand and seventy-four</num> versts, or <measure n="716miles" type="distance">seven hundred and sixteen miles</measure>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>So great is the traffic upon it at present that it is literally covered from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other with trains of wagons passing in both directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>The trade which formerly passed down the <rs>Baltic</rs> now seeks its outlet into <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> by this route.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>So great is this now that it seems hardly possible that <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> can feel the effect of the blockade very sensibly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>New channels are opened, and immense additional numbers of men, animals, and capital are now employed in the land-transportation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>During their residence at <placeName reg="Sankt-Peterburg, Sankt-Peterburg, Rossiya" key="tgn,7010273">St. Petersburg</placeName>, the officers of the commission were treated with much courtesy by the civil and military authorities, and all possible facilities were afforded to them for examining the various military establishments in the vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>They were presented to the <rs>Emperor</rs>, at his request, and graciously received by him. But they did not succeed in obtaining permission to go to <placeName reg="Sevastopol', Krym, Ukrayina" key="tgn,7012057">Sebastopol</placeName>, because the officers in command there had requested that no strangers should be permitted to come there, as such visits occasioned them a great deal of embarrassment; and though the <rs>Emperor</rs>, of course, might overrule such objections, yet he felt bound to defer to the strongly-expressed wishes of officers placed in such responsible positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Nothing could be urged in reply to this; and, disappointed as they were, they could not, as <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>military men, fail to respect the <rs>Emperor</rs>'s deference to the views of his subordinates.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The result was that they confined their examination to the camps, depots, parks, workshops, &amp;c. of the <rs>English</rs>, Sardinian, <pb id="p.68" n="68"/>and Turkish armies, never entering the <rs>French</rs> camps in the <name>Crimea</name> except on visits of courtesy.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>From the preceding hasty and imperfect account of the defences of <placeName reg="Sevastopol', Krym, Ukrayina" key="tgn,7012057">Sebastopol</placeName>, it will appear how little foundation there was for the generally received accounts of the stupendous dimensions of the works, and of new systems of fortifications brought into play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>The plain truth is <pb id="p.72" n="72"/>that these defences were simple temporary fortifications of rather greater dimensions than usual, and that not a single new principle of engineering was there developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>It is true that there were several novel minor details, such as the rope mantelets, the use of the iron tanks, &amp;c.; but the whole merit consisted in the admirable adaptation of well-known principles to the peculiar locality and circumstances of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Neither can it be asserted that the plans of the various works were perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>On the contrary, there is no impropriety in believing that, if Todtleben were called upon to do the same work over again, he would probably introduce better close-flanking arrangements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/> These remarks are not intended to, nor can they, detract from the reputation of the <rs>Russian</rs> engineer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>His labors and their results will be handed down in history as the most triumphant and enduring monument of the value of fortifications, and his name must ever be placed in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rank of military engineers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>But, in our admiration of the talent and energy of the engineer, it must not be forgotten that the inert masses which he raised would have been useless without the skilful artillery and heroic infantry who defended them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Much stronger places than <placeName reg="Sevastopol', Krym, Ukrayina" key="tgn,7012057">Sebastopol</placeName> have often fallen under far less obstinate and well-combined attacks than that to which it was subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>There can be no danger in expressing the conviction that the siege of <placeName reg="Sevastopol', Krym, Ukrayina" key="tgn,7012057">Sebastopol</placeName> called forth the most magnificent defence of fortifications that has ever yet occurred.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The next is a description of the final assault:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>A few minutes later than the assault upon the <name>Malakoff</name>, the <rs>English</rs> attacked the <name>Redan</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The <rs>Russians</rs> being now upon the alert, they did not pass over the open space before them without loss; but the mass succeeded in crossing the ditch and gaining the salient of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/><pb id="p.73" n="73"/>Finding themselves entirely unsupported, they at once took shelter behind the traverses, whence the example and efforts of their officers did not avail to draw them, in order to occupy the work closing the gorge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Having in vain used every effort, having despatched every officer of his staff to the rear urging that supports should be at once sent up, and seeing that the <name>Russians</name> were now beginning to assemble in force, the commander of the <rs>English</rs> storming party reluctantly determined to proceed himself to obtain reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Scarcely had he reached the trenches, and at last obtained authority to move up the required succor, when, upon turning to lead them forward, he saw the party he had left in the work rapidly and hopelessly driven out at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>No further effort was made to carry the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>It would, in all probability, have failed, and would only have caused a useless sacrifice of men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The failure of the <rs>English</rs> assault may be attributed partly to the fact that their advanced trenches were too small to accommodate the requisite force without confusion, in part to their not being pushed sufficiently near the <name>Redan</name>, but chiefly to that total absence of conduct and skill in the arrangements for the assault which left the storming party entirely without support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Had it been followed at once by strong reinforcements, it is almost certain that the <rs>English</rs> would have retained possession of the work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>The <num value="2">two</num> <name>French</name> attacks on the west of the central ravine were probably intended only as feints: at all events, the parties engaged were soon driven back to their trenches with considerable loss, and effected nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Their attempts upon the Little Redan, and the works connecting it with the <name>Malakoff</name>, met with even less success than the <rs>English</rs> assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The <rs>Russians</rs> repulsed the <rs>French</rs> with great loss, meeting with the bayonet the more adventurous men who reached the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Thus, in <num value="5">five</num> <pb id="p.74" n="74"/>points out of <num value="6">six</num>, the defenders were fully victorious; but, unfortunately for them, the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> was the decisive point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>In their admirable arrangements for the attack of the <name>Malakoff</name>, the <rs>French</rs> counted on <num value="2">two</num> things for success:--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, they had ascertained that the <name>Russians</name> were in the habit of relieving the guard of the <name>Malakoff</name> at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, and that a great part of the old guard marched out before the new <num value="1">one</num> arrived, in order to avoid the loss which would arise from crowding the work with men; in the second place, it was determined to keep up a most violent vertical fire until the very moment of the assault, thus driving the <name>Russians</name> into the bomb-proofs, and enabling the storming party to enter the work with but little opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The hour of noon was therefore selected for the assault, and the strong columns intended for the work were at an early hour assembled in the advanced trenches, all in admirable order, and furnished with precise instructions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The mortars maintained an unremitting fire until the moment appointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>The very instant the last volley was discharged, the storming party of Zouaves rushed over the <num value="30">thirty</num> paces before them, and were in the work before the astonished <rs>Russians</rs> knew what had happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>It was stated that this party lost but <num value="11">eleven</num> men in entering the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Other troops advanced rapidly to the support of the storming party, a bridge was formed by rolling up <num value="5">five</num> ladders with planks lashed to them, a communication was at once commenced between the advanced trench and the bridge, brigade after brigade passed over, the redoubt was at once occupied by the storming party, and thus the <name>Malakoff</name>, and with it <placeName reg="Sevastopol', Krym, Ukrayina" key="tgn,7012057">Sebastopol</placeName>, was won. The few <rs>Russians</rs> remaining in the work made a desperate resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Many gallant attempts were made by <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n0065.0003.00074.00266" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> columns to ascend the steep slope in rear and regain the lost work; but the road was narrow, difficult, and obstructed, the position strong, and the <rs>French</rs> in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>All their furious efforts were in vain, and the <name>Malakoff</name> <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>remained in the possession of those who had so gallantly and skilfully won it. With regard to the final retreat to the north side, it can only be said that a personal examination of the locality merely confirms its necessity, and the impression so generally entertained that it was the finest operation of the war: so admirably was it carried out that not a straggler remained behind; a few men so severely wounded as to be unfit for rough and hurried transportation were the sole ghastly human trophies that remained to the allies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>The retreat, being a more difficult operation than the assault, may be worthy of a higher admiration; but the <rs>Russian</rs> retreat to the north side and the <rs>French</rs> assault upon the <name>Malakoff</name> must each be regarded as a masterpiece of its kind, deserving the closest study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>It is difficult to imagine what point in either can be criticized; for both evinced consummate skill, discipline, coolness, and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>With regard to the artillery, I would merely remark that the <rs>Russian</rs> guns were not of unusual calibre, consisting chiefly of <num value="24">twenty-four</num>-, <num value="32">thirty-two</num>-, and <num value="42">forty-two</num>-pounders, and that the termination of the siege was mainly due to the extensive use of mortars finally resorted to by the allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>If they had been employed in the beginning as the main reliance, the siege would have been of shorter duration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The causes of the unusual duration of this siege naturally resolve themselves into <num value="3">three</num> classes: the skilful disposition of the <name>Russians</name>, the faults of the allies, and natural causes beyond the control of either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Among the latter may be mentioned the natural strength of the position and the severity of the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class there may be alluded to:--the skill with which the <rs>Russian</rs> engineers availed themselves of the nature of the ground; the moral courage which induced them to undertake the defence of an open town with a weak garrison; the constant use they made of sorties, among which <pb id="p.76" n="76"/>may properly be classed the battles of <placeName key="tgn,7010109" n="1.000 1" reg="balaklava,krym,ukrayina,europe">Balaklava</placeName>, Inkermann, and the <name>Tchernaya</name>; the ready ingenuity with which they availed themselves of the resources derived from the fleet; the fine practice of their artillery; their just appreciation of the true use of field-works, and the admirable courage they always evinced in standing to their works, to repel assaults at the point of the bayonet; the employment of rifle-pits on an extensive scale; finally, the constant reinforcements which they soon commenced receiving, and which enabled them to fill the gaps made in their ranks by disease and the projectiles of the allies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The evidences of skill on the part of the allies, as well as the apparent faults on all sides, having been already alluded to, it is believed that the means have been furnished to enable any <num value="1">one</num> to draw his own conclusions as to the history of this memorable passage of arms.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Their movements are the lightest and most graceful I have ever seen; the stride is long, but the foot seems scarcely to touch the ground, and the march is apparently made without effort or fatigue.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The following is a description of the <rs>Russian Cossacks</rs>:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> peculiarities which cannot fail to arrest the attention and command the reflection of the observer of the <rs>Russian</rs> cavalry: these are, the general division of the cavalry into regulars and irregulars; and the corps of dragoons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>The irregulars may be comprehended in the general name of Cossacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Yet their peculiarities of armament, costume, and action are as varied as their origin; while the sources of the latter are as multifarious as the tribes which compose the mass of <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n0065.0003.00078.00268" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> nationality, and the circumstances which, through centuries of warfare, have finally united into <num value="1">one</num> compact whole a multitude of conflicting and heterogeneous elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>But, with all this diversity, there are important and peculiar characteristics which pervade the mass, and are common to every individual, with as much uniformity and certainty as that with which the firm government of the <name>Czar</name> is now extended over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>These peculiarities are: intelligence, quickness of vision, hearing, and all the senses; individuality; trustworthiness on duty; the power of enduring fatigue, privation, and the extremes of climate; great address in the use of weapons; strong feeling for their common country; caution, united with courage capable of being excited to the highest pitch: in short, the combination of qualities necessary for partisan troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The events of more than <num value="1">one</num> campaign have proved, besides, that these irregulars can be used successfully in line against the best regular cavalry of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/> Circumstances of geography and climate have given to these men a race of horses in every way adapted to their riders; the <rs>Cossack</rs> horse is excelled by none in activity and hardiness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>The <rs>Cossack</rs> neglects no opportunity of feeding his <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>horse; during short halts, even under fire, he gives him whatever is to be had; the horse refuses nothing that is offered him, and eats whenever he has the opportunity, for he has not acquired the pernicious habit of eating only at regular hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Some idea may be formed of the power of endurance of the <name>Cossacks</name> and their horses from the fact that, in a certain expedition against Khiva, there were <num value="3500">three thousand five hundred</num> regular <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> troops and <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> Cossacks: of the regulars but <num value="1000">one thousand</num> returned, of the <name>Cossacks</name> but <num value="60">sixty</num> perished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The tendency of events, during the present century, has been to assimilate the organization of the <name>Cossacks</name> to that of the regulars, to a certain extent: whether the effect of this has been to modify or destroy their valuable individual characteristics may yet remain to be proved in a general war; the events of the campaign of <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName> are said to indicate that more regularity of action has by no means impaired their efficiency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>This brief description of the qualities of the irregular cavalry indicates at once the use made of them in war: they watch while the regulars repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>All the duty of advanced posts, patrols, reconnoissances, escorting trains, carrying despatches, acting as orderlies, &amp;c., is performed in preference by the <name>Cossacks</name>: the consequence is, that, on the day of battle, the regular cavalry are brought upon the field in full force and undiminished vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Under cover of these active irregulars, a Russian army enjoys a degree of repose unknown to any other; while, on the other hand, it is difficult for their antagonists to secure their outposts and foil their stealthy movements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The rapidity and length of their marches are almost incredible; a march of <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> is a common thing: they will make forced marches of <measure n="70miles" type="distance">seventy miles</measure>; in a thickly-settled country they have, in <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, made <num value="6">six</num> marches of ordinary cavalry without being discovered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>In concluding this subject, it is impossible to repress <pb id="p.80" n="80"/>the conviction that in many of the tribes of our frontier <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0065.0003.00080.00269" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, such as the <name>Delawares</name>, Kickapoos, &amp;c., we possess the material for the formation of partisan troops fully equal to the <name>Cossacks</name>: in the event of a serious war on this continent, their employment, under the regulations and restrictions necessary to restrain their tendency to unnecessary cruelty, would be productive of most important advantages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>In our contests with the hostile <rs>Indians</rs>, bodies of these men, commanded by active and energetic regular officers and supported by regular troops, would undoubtedly be of great service.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>The possession of those roads by us, in connection with the movement on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, would go far towards determining the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> by the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>In the mean time, all the passes into <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> from the east should be securely guarded; but I would advise no movement from that quarter towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, unless the political condition of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> renders it impossible or inexpedient for us to make the movement upon <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> through that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>The force must be supplied with the necessary engineer and pontoon trains, and with transportation for every thing save tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>Its general line of operations should be so directed that water-transportation can be availed of from point to point, by means of the ocean and the rivers emptying into it. An essential feature of the plan of operations will be the employment of a strong naval force to protect the movements of a fleet of transports intended to convey a considerable body of troops from point to point of the enemy's sea-coast, thus either creating diversions and rendering it necessary for them to detach largely from their main body in order to protect such of their cities as may be threatened, or else landing and forming establishments on their coast at any favorable places that opportunity might offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>This naval <pb id="p.110" n="110"/>force should also co-operate with the main army in its efforts to seize the important seaboard towns of the rebels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>It cannot be ignored that the construction of railroads has introduced a new and very important element into war, by the great facilities thus given for concentrating at particular positions large masses of troops from remote sections, and by creating new strategic points and lines of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>It is intended to overcome this difficulty by the partial operations suggested, and such others as the particular case may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>We must endeavor to seize places on the railways in the rear of the enemy's points of concentration, and we must threaten their seaboard cities, in order that each State may be forced, by the necessity of its own defence, to diminish its contingent to the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>The proposed movement down the <rs>Mississippi</rs> will produce important results in this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>That advance and the progress of the main army at the <rs>East</rs> will materially assist each other, by diminishing the resistance to be encountered by each.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>The tendency of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> movement upon all questions connected with cotton is too well understood by the <rs>President</rs> and Cabinet to need any illustration from me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>There is another independent movement that has often been suggested, and which has always recommended itself to my judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>I refer to a movement from <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName>, through the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Indian Territory</placeName>, upon <placeName reg="Red River, Brown, Texas" key="tgn,2611953">Red River</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Texas</placeName>, for the purpose of protecting and developing the latent Union and free-State sentiment well known to predominate in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Texas</placeName>, and which, like a similar sentiment in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, will, if protected, ultimately organize that section into a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>How far it will be possible to support this movement by an advance through <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> from <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>is a matter which I have not sufficiently examined to be able to express a decided opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>If at all practicable, it is eminently desirable, as bringing into play the resources and warlike qualities of the <rs>Pacific States</rs>, as well as identifying them with our cause and cementing the bond of union between them and the <rs>General Government</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>If it is not departing too far from my province, I will venture to suggest the policy of an intimate alliance and cordial understanding with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>: their sympathies and interests are with us,--their antipathies exclusively against our enemies and their institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>I think it would not be difficult to obtain from the <rs>Mexican Government</rs> the right to use, at least during the present contest, the road from Guaymas to <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>: this concession would very materially reduce the obstacles of the column moving from the <rs>Pacific</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>A similar permission to use their territory for the passage of troops between the <rs>Panuco</rs> and the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> would enable us to throw a column of troops by a good road from <placeName key="tgn,1018380" n="1.000 4" reg="tampico,tamaulipas,mexico,north and central america">Tampico</placeName>, or some of the small harbors north of it, upon and across the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, without risk and scarcely firing a shot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>To what extent, if any, it would be desirable to take into service and employ <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> soldiers, is a question entirely political, on which I do not venture to offer an opinion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>The force I have recommended is large; the expense is great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>It is possible that a smaller force might accomplish the object in view; but I understand it to be the purpose of this great nation to re-establish the power of its Government, and to restore peace to its citizens, in the shortest possible time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>The question to be decided is simply this: shall we crush the rebellion at <num value="1">one</num> blow, terminate the war in <num value="1">one</num> campaign, or shall we leave it for a legacy to our descendants?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/><pb id="p.112" n="112"/></p> 
<p>When the extent of the possible line of operations is considered, the force asked for the main army under my command cannot be regarded as unduly large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>Every mile we advance carries us farther from our base of operations, and renders detachments necessary to cover our communications, while the enemy will be constantly concentrating as he falls back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>I propose, with the force which I have requested, not only to drive the enemy out of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and occupy <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, but to occupy <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0065.0005.00112.00397" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and New Orleans; in other words, to move into the heart of the enemy's country and crush out the rebellion in its very heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>By seizing and repairing the railroads as we advance, the difficulties of transportation will be materially diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>It is perhaps unnecessary to state that, in addition to the forces named in this memorandum, strong reserves should be formed, ready to supply any losses that may occur.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>In conclusion, I would submit that the exigencies of the treasury may be lessened by making only partial payments to our troops when in the enemy's country, and by giving the obligations of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for such supplies as may there be obtained. </p><closer><signed><persName n="Mcclellan,,George,B.,," id="n0065.0005.00112.00398" reg="default:Mcclellan,George,B.,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName>  <surname>Mcclellan</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>.</signed></closer></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>I do not think the events of the war have proved these views upon the methods and plans of its conduct altogether incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>It is probable that I did underestimate the time necessary for the completion of arms and equipments.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>This simple and modest statement is read with melancholy interest by the light of the events which have transpired since the date of the memorandum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>And that portion of the <rs>American</rs> people &mdash; we believe, the larger portion &mdash; which is willing to hear before it judges, will not fail to recognize in the memorandum itself the sagacious and comprehensive views of a man who has carefully studied the problem before him, and believe that he had found a solution for it. It steers clear of the safe generalities in which mediocrity takes refuge, as well as the wild predictions that rash self-confidence is apt to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>His conclusions are drawn from a wide and patient survey of the field before him. Here is a plan broad in its scope and well con. sidered in its details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>It may be that the event might not, under any circumstances, have responded to his expectations; it may be that the soldier might not have had the means to execute what the statesman had conceived: it is enough to know that the opportunity was never given him to try the experiment fairly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>When he spoke of the possibility of ending the war by a single campaign, he perhaps underestimated both the moral and material forces arrayed against him; but, in the multitude of predictions as to the duration of the war which have not come to pass, an anticipation like this will not be treasured up against him.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>The object of your expedition is <num value="1">one</num> of vital importance,--the capture of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>The route selected is up the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName>, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> obstacle to be encountered (perhaps the only <num value="1">one</num>) is in the resistance offered by <placeName key="tgn,7017764" n="1.000 1" reg="Buras, Plaquemines, Louisiana">Forts St. Philip</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Jackson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>It is expected that the navy can reduce these works: in that case, you will, after their capture, leave a sufficient garrison in them to render them perfectly secure; and it is recommended that, on the upward passage, a few heavy guns and some troops be left at the pilot-station (at the forks of the river), to cover a retreat in the event of a disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>These troops and guns will, of course, be removed as soon as the forts are captured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Should the navy fail to reduce the works, you will land your forces and siege-train, and endeavor to breach the works, silence their fire, and carry them by assault.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>The. next resistance will be near the <rs type="place">English Bend</rs>, where there are some earthen batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Here it may be necessary for you to land your troops and co-operate with the naval attack, although it is more than probable that the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>, unassisted, can accomplish the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>If these works are taken, the city of <placeName reg="New Orleans, Orleans, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014214">New Orleans</placeName> necessarily falls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>In that event, it will probably be best to occupy <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName> <pb id="p.120" n="120"/>with the mass of your troops, also the eastern bank of the river above the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>It may be necessary to place some troops in the city to preserve order; but, if there appears to be sufficient Union sentiment to control the city, it may be best, for purposes of discipline, to keep your men out of the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>After obtaining possession of New Orleans, it will be necessary to reduce all the works guarding its approaches from the east, and particularly to gain the <placeName key="tgn,2490192" n="1.000 1" reg="manchac, tangipahoa, louisiana">Manchac</placeName> Pass.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>A feint on <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName> may facilitate the objects we have in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>I need not call your attention to the necessity of gaining possession of all the rolling stock you can on the different railways, and of obtaining control of the roads themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>The occupation of <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName> by a combined naval and land force should be accomplished as soon as possible after you have gained New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>Then endeavor to open your communication with the northern column by the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, always bearing in mind the necessity of occupying <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson, Mississippi</placeName>, as soon as you can safely do so, either after or before you have effected the junction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>Allow nothing to divert you from obtaining full possession of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the approaches to New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>When that object is accomplished to its fullest extent, it will be necessary to make a combined attack on <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, in order to gain possession of the harbor and works, as well as to control the railway terminus at the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>In regard to this, I will send more detailed instructions as the operations of the <rs>Northern</rs> column develop themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>I may briefly state that the general objects of the expedition are--<hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi>, the reduction of New Orleans and all its approaches; then <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> and its defences; then <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName>, &amp;c. It is probable that by the time New Orleans is reduced, it will be in the power of the <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>Government to reinforce the land forces sufficiently to accomplish all these objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>In the mean time, you will please give all the assistance in your power to the army and navy commanders in your vicinity, never losing sight of the fact that the great object to be achieved is the capture and firm retention of New Orleans.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>It was the purpose of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> that the various parts of the plan should be carried out simultaneously, as far as was possible, and in co-operation along the whole line of movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>In this general scheme the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was to bear its part,--a leading part, it is true, but still a part in concert with other forces of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>His position was thus in itself <num value="1">one</num> of great responsibility; but there were extrinsic elements which added to its burdens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The American people are easily elated and easily depressed, and they had passed through both of these states of feeling during the eventful year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>At the breaking out of the war, amidst the magnificent uprising of the nation to sustain the <rs>Government</rs>, we had exulted in the confident expectation that the rebellion <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>would at once be crushed and broken into fragments by the irresistible force arrayed against it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>The people murmured and chafed at the delay that clogged the movements of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>; the press, with its myriad voices, gave utterance to the feeling, and the cry <quote>On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>!</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>These questions were substantially answered in the letter to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> above referred to, which appears in <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0006.00142.00476" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s Report; but its length forbids its being copied in full, and only an abstract of its contents can be given.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>He begins with a brief statement of the condition of the troops when he assumed the command in <dateStruct value="1861-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and of the defenceless position of the capital at that time, and thus recapitulates what had been accomplished up to the date of writing:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>The capital is secure against attack; the extensive fortifications erected by the labor of our troops enable a small garrison to hold it against a numerous army; the enemy have been held in check; the <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">State of Maryland</placeName> is securely in our possession; the detached counties of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> are again within the pale of our laws, and all apprehension of trouble in <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName> is at an end; the enemy are confined to the positions they occupied before the disaster of the <dateStruct value="-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>More than all this, I have <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>now under my command a well-drilled and reliable army, to which the destinies of the country may be confidently committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>This army is young and untried in battle; but it is animated by the highest spirit, and is capable of great deeds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>That so much has been accomplished and such an army created in so short a time from nothing, will hereafter be regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the highest glories of the <name>Administration</name> and the nation.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>After telling the <rs>Secretary</rs> that he has not yet under his command such a force as he asked for in his earliest papers submitted to the <rs>President</rs>, he thus proceeds:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>When I was placed in command of the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, I immediately turned my attention to the whole field of operations, regarding the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> as only <num value="1">one</num>, while the most important, of the masses under my command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>I confess that I did not then appreciate the total absence of a general plan which had before existed, nor did I know that utter disorganization and want of preparation pervaded the <rs>Western</rs> armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/> I took it for granted that they were nearly, if not quite, in condition to move towards the fulfilment of my plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>I acknowledge that I made a great mistake.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>I sent at once &mdash; with approval of the <rs>Executive</rs> &mdash; officers I considered competent to command in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>Their instructions looked to prompt movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>I soon found that the labor of creation and organization had to be performed there: transportation, arms, clothing, artillery, discipline, all were wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>These things required time to procure them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>The generals in command have done their work most creditably; but we are still delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>I had hoped that a <pb id="p.144" n="144"/>general advance could be made during the good weather of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>: I was mistaken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/> My wish was to gain possession of the <orgName n="Eastern Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Eastern Tennessee Railroad</orgName>, as a preliminary movement, then to follow it up immediately by an attack on <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as nearly at the same time as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>I have ever regarded our true policy as being that of fully preparing ourselves, and then seeking for the most decisive results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>I do not wish to waste life in useless battles, but prefer to strike at the heart.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>He next proceeds to state that <num value="2">two</num> bases of operation presented themselves for the advance of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>,--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00144.00477" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, its present position, involving a direct attack upon the intrenched positions of the enemy at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, &amp;c., or else a movement to turn <num value="1">one</num> or both of those positions, or a combination of the <num value="2">two</num> plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>The relative force of the <num value="2">two</num> armies would not justify an attack on both flanks of the enemy; and an attack on his left flank alone would involve a long line of wagon-communication, and could not prevent him from collecting for the decisive battle all the detachments now on his extreme right and left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>He next sets forth in great detail the difficulties and dangers of an attack upon the right flank, by the line of the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, and a crossing of the <rs>Potomac</rs> below that river, showing a minute knowledge of the localities of the region, and demonstrating to his correspondent the great advantage possessed by the enemy in the central position he occupied, with roads diverging in every direction, <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>and a strong line of defence, enabling him to await an attack with a small force on <num value="1">one</num> flank, while he concentrates every thing on the other for a decisive action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>Among other difficulties, he speaks of <quote>the present unprecedented and impassable condition of the roads.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>But, supposing the movement in this direction to be successful, the results, he thinks, would be confined to the possession of the field of battle, the evacuation of the line of the <rs>Upper Potomac</rs> by the enemy, and the moral effect of the victory,--important results, it is true, but not decisive of the war, or securing the destruction of the enemy's main army or the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> base of operations available for the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> is that of the <rs type="place">Lower Chesapeake Bay</rs>, which affords the shortest possible land-route to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and strikes directly at the heart of the enemy's power in the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>In favor of this plan he thus reasons:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/></p> 
<p>The roads in that region are passable at all periods of the year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>The country now alluded to is much more favorable for offensive operations than that in front of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> (which is <hi rend="italics">very</hi> unfavorable),--much more level, more cleared land, the woods less dense, the soil more sandy, and the spring some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> earlier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>A movement in force on that line obliges the enemy to abandon his intrenched position at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> in order to hasten to cover <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>He <hi rend="italics">must</hi> do this; for, should he permit us to occupy <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, his destruction can be averted only by entirely defeating us in a battle in which he must be the assailant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>This movement, if successful, gives us the capital, the communications, the supplies, <pb id="p.146" n="146"/>of the rebels; <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> would fall, all the waters of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> would be ours, all <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be in our power, and the enemy forced to abandon <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>The alternative presented to the enemy would be to beat us in a position selected by ourselves, disperse, or pass beneath the <rs type="place">Caudine forks</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>Should we be beaten in a battle, we have a perfectly secure retreat down the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> upon <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>, with our flanks perfectly covered by the fleet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>During the whole movement our left flank is covered by the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>Our right is secure, for the reason that the enemy is too distant to reach us in time: he can only oppose us in front; we bring our fleet into full play.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>After a successful battle, our position would be &mdash; <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00478" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> forming our left, <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> held securely, our centre connecting <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00479" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> with <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00480" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> both by <persName n="Raleigh,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00481" reg="mostcommon:Raleigh,nomatch:0"><surname>Raleigh</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00482" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Alabama</placeName>, <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00483" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,H.,W.,,:10"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>The next movement would be to connect with <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00484" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> on the left, by reducing <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>; to advance our centre into <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>; to push <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00485" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> either towards <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> or to unite with the main army in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>; to throw <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n0065.0006.00146.00486" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,H.,W.,,:10"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> southward to meet the naval expedition from New Orleans.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>We should then be in a condition to reduce at our leisure all the <rs>Southern</rs> sea-ports, to occupy all the avenues of communication, to use the great outlet of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, to re-establish our Government and arms in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, to force the slaves to labor for our subsistence instead of that of the rebels, to bid defiance to all foreign interference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>Such is the object I have ever had in view; this is the general plan which I hope to accomplish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>For many long months I have labored to prepare the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> to play its part in the programme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>From the day when I was placed in command of all our <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>armies, I have exerted myself to place all the other armies in such a condition that they too could perform their allotted duties.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>He then tells his correspondent that, if it should be determined to operate from the <rs>Lower Chesapeake</rs>, the best point of landing would be <placeName reg="Urbanna, Middlesex, Virginia" key="tgn,2114705">Urbana</placeName>, on the <rs>Lower Rappahannock</rs>, and states his reasons for the opinion; but, if circumstances should render it advisable not to land there, either <placeName reg="Mobjack Bay, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1113456">Mobjack Bay</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> might be resorted to. A large amount of cheap water transportation would be requisite to move the army to whatever point might be selected as a base of operations; and he gives some details in relation to this important point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>The letter thus concludes:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>The total force to be thrown upon the new line would be, according to circumstances, from <num value="110000">one hundred and ten thousand</num> to <num value="140000">one hundred and forty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>I hope to use the latter number by bringing fresh troops into <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and still leaving it quite safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>I fully realize that, in all projects offered, time will probably be the most valuable consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>It is my decided opinion that, in that point of view, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> plan should be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>It is possible &mdash; nay, highly probable &mdash; that the weather and state of the roads may be such as to delay the direct movement from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, with its unsatisfactory results and great risks, far beyond the time required to complete the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, we can fix no definite time for an advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>The roads have gone from bad to worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>Nothing like their present condition was ever known here before: they are impassable at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>We are entirely at the mercy of the weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>It is by no means certain that we can beat them at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>On the other line I regard success as certain by all the chances of war. We <pb id="p.148" n="148"/>demoralize the enemy by forcing him to abandon his prepared position for <num value="1">one</num> which we have chosen, in which all is in our favor and where success must produce immense results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>My judgment, as a general, is clearly in favor of this project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>Nothing is certain in war; but all the chances are in favor of this movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>So much am I in favor of the southern line of operations, that I would prefer the move from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> as a base, as a certain though less brilliant movement than that from <placeName reg="Urbanna, Middlesex, Virginia" key="tgn,2114705">Urbana</placeName>, to an attack upon <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>I know that his <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> the <rs>President</rs>, you, and I, all agree in our wishes, and that these wishes are, to bring this war to a close as promptly as the means in our possession will permit.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>These forces were deemed by him amply adequate to insure the safety of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and to give everybody there an entire sense of security,--a <pb id="p.168" n="168"/>conclusion not to be doubted, as the following facts show.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>There was no reason to apprehend an attack by way of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>; for the enemy in their retreat across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> had destroyed all the railroad-bridges behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>Had they attempted such a movement, their progress must have been very slow; for they must have rebuilt their bridges, and this would have announced their purpose beforehand and afforded ample time to concentrate a large body of forces at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>Nor was there any real ground of apprehension from the <rs type="place">Valley of the Shenandoah</rs>; because the movement of the army on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would make it impossible for the enemy to leave in that region men enough to overpower the large body of troops we had there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>But, in <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0006.00168.00590" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s opinion, the way to defend <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was to attack <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; and the greater the force thrown against the rebel capital, the greater the security of our own. Strongly fortified as <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was, capable of being readily reinforced from the <rs>North</rs>, it was manifest that the enemy could not afford to detach from his main army a force sufficient to capture it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>Here were solid grounds enough, it would appear, for <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0006.00168.00591" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s conclusion that he had left <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> perfectly safe; but, unhappily, fears, panics, and apprehensions take their rise in that part of the mind which is not reached by the voice of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>Whether <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> were safe or not <pb id="p.169" n="169"/>was a matter of sound military judgment; but as a matter of fact it is certain that from the moment the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> landed upon the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> an uneasy sense of insecurity took possession of the minds of the <rs>President</rs>, the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, and the members of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>The public in general shared this feeling; and the <rs>Northern</rs> press encouraged and increased it. All over the loyal States the question of the safety of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was discussed, with abundant zeal and very little knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>Some of this alarm may have been counterfeited for political effect; but without doubt much of it was real; and this should be borne in mind, when discussing measures subsequently adopted, disastrous in their consequences, but, unquestionably, inspired by an honest but miserable fright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>It was destined, in the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that our cause should suffer alike from unreasonable hopes and extravagant fears.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>gentlemen:--The exceedingly critical condition of affairs compels me to address to you this circular, and to endeavor, with all the earnestness and force of language I can command, to explain some of the difficulties connected with military railroad transportation, and ask your co-operation and assistance in forwarding supplies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>The army is dependent for its supplies upon a single-track railroad, in bad condition, without sidings of sufficient length, without wood, with a short supply of water, and with insufficient equipments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>This road is taxed with an amount of business equal to the ordinary freights of a large city,--an amount <num value="4">four</num> times as large as it has ever before been called on to accommodate, and twice as large as I reported to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0011.00317.01348" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> its capacity for transportation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>There cannot be the most distant prospect of keeping the army supplied without constant, uninterrupted movement <pb id="p.318" n="318"/>of trains day and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>The delicate machinery of the road must not be deranged by any detention or interference.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>* * * * * * * *</p> 
<p>Again I say that, if the army is to be supplied, the condition which, in its importance, transcends all others, is that no delay &mdash; not even a minute &mdash; should be allowed to occur in unloading cars, if it can be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>Movement, unceasing movement, in the trains, is our only salvation.

<p>In this Report I have confined myself to a plain narrative of such facts as are necessary for the purposes of history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>Where it was possible, I have preferred to give these facts in the language of despatches, written at the time of their occurrence, rather than to attempt a new relation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>The reports of the subordinate commanders, hereto <pb id="p.349" n="349"/>annexed, recite what time and space would fail me to mention here,--those individual instances of conspicuous bravery and skill by which every battle was marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>To them I must especially refer; for without them this narrative would be incomplete, and justice fail to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>But I cannot omit to tender to my corps commanders, and to the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs> under them, such ample recognition of their cordial co-operation and their devoted services as those reports abundantly avouch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>I have not sought to defend the army which I had the honor to command, nor myself, against the hostile criticisms once so rife.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>It has seemed to me that nothing more was required than such a plain and truthful narrative to enable those whose right it is to form a correct judgment on the important matters involved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>This Report is, in fact, a history of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>During the period occupied in the organization of that army, it served as a barrier against the advance of a lately victorious enemy while the fortification of the capital was in progress; and, under the discipline which it then received, it acquired strength, education, and some of that experience which is necessary to success in active operations, and which enabled it afterwards to sustain itself under circumstances trying to the most heroic men. Frequent skirmishes occurred along the lines, conducted with great gallantry, which inured our troops to the realities of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>The army grew into shape but slowly; and the delays which attended on the obtaining of arms, continuing late into the winter of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">62</year></dateStruct>, were no less trying to the soldiers than to the people of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>Even at the time of the organization of the <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular campaign</rs>, some of the finest regiments were without rifles; nor were the utmost exertions on the part of the military <pb id="p.350" n="350"/>authorities adequate to overcome the obstacles to active service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>When, at length, the army was in condition to take the field, the <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular campaign</rs> was planned and entered upon with enthusiasm by officers and men. Had this campaign been followed up as it was designed, I cannot doubt that it would have resulted in a glorious triumph to our arms and the permanent restoration of the power of the <rs>Government</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, if not throughout the revolting States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>It was, however, otherwise ordered; and, instead of reporting a victorious campaign, it has been my duty to relate the heroism of a reduced army, sent upon an expedition into an enemy's country, there to abandon <num value="1">one</num> and originate another and new plan of campaign, which might and would have been successful if supported with appreciation of its necessities, but which failed because of the repeated failure of promised support at the most critical and, as it proved, the most fatal moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>That heroism surpasses ordinary description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>Its illustration must be left for the pen of the historian in times of calm reflection, when the nation shall be looking back to the past from the midst of peaceful days.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>For me, now, it is sufficient to say that my comrades were victors on every field save <num value="1">one</num>; and there the endurance of a single corps accomplished the object oa its fighting, and, by securing to the army its transit to the <rs>James</rs>, left to the enemy a ruinous and barren victory.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>That siege was successfully conducted by the army; and when these strong works at length yielded to our approaches, the troops rushed forward to the sanguinary but successful <rs n="Battle of Williamsburg" type="battle">battle of Williamsburg</rs>, and thus opened an almost unresisted advance to the banks of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3064"/>A few remarks are, consequently, submitted, which are in the nature of a comment upon some points of the evidence presented in the preceding pages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> of all: there are some persons who deny to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0013.00357.01488" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> all merit whatever as a commander, maintaining that he has neither the capacity to plan a campaign nor to fight a battle, nd that every thing successfully done by him was either the work of others or the result of pure accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>With such persons it is useless to reason, as to do so would be simply a waste of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/>No arguments or considerations would have any power to shake an impression like this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>Men who hold this opinion of the conqueror of <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName> are, in the intellectual line, legitimate <pb id="p.358" n="358"/>descendants of those subjects of <persName><foreName>George</foreName> the <genName n="3">Third</genName></persName> who used to maintain that <persName n="Bonaparte,,Napoleon,,," id="n0065.0013.00358.01489" reg="default:Bonaparte,Napoleon,,,"><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> was deficient in the quality of personal courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3069"/>A prejudice of this kind is as much proof against reason as the diseased fancy of a hypochondriac who believes that his legs are made of glass, or that he is followed everywhere by a blue dog. <quote>You must have observed,</quote> said <persName n="Grenville,Mister,,,," id="n0065.0013.00358.01490" reg="mostcommon:Grenville,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Grenville</surname></persName>, in a letter to <persName n="Pitt,Mister,,,," id="n0065.0013.00358.01491" reg="mostcommon:Pitt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pitt</surname></persName>, <quote>that of all impressions the most difficult to be removed are those which have no reason to support them; because against them no reason can be applied.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/>But there are other persons, more reasonable, more discriminating, who, while they allow <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0013.00358.01492" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to be an accomplished and meritorious officer, capable of doing excellent service in a subordinate sphere, hold also the opinion that when at the head of an army his good qualities are neutralized by his slowness, his over-cautiousness, his want of dash, his inability to take advantage of the sudden opportunities which the fortune of war presents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/>The force of this objection is in some measure neutralized by the fact that it is so common in military history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3072"/>The popular mind is always eager for results in war, and ignorant of the conditions essential to success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>A calm but severe rebuke, and the cessation of all friendly intercourse with the writer, discovered the general's abhorrence of this detestable policy.</quote> --<persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n0065.0013.00358.01494" reg="mostcommon:Napier,Wm,,,:1"><surname>Napier</surname></persName>.</p></note> <pb id="p.359" n="359"/>while their campaigns were going on, were constantly censured for their slowness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>It is a charge easily made, and not easily answered; for the defence must often rest upon a variety of considerations which the critic is too impatient to listen to. <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0013.00359.01495" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is, by nature and temperament, wisely cautious, prudent, and deliberate,--the reverse of rash and impulsive; and these traits are, of course, shown in his military career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>lie never incurs great risks or plays a desperate game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>He is, besides, a humane man, very careful of the lives of his soldiers, and not needlessly shedding human blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/>And, lastly, he is a man of moral firmness and just self-reliance, who will never be induced by popular clamor to take a step which he deems unwise, or forego a precaution which he deems necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>A man like this at the head of an army will often incur the charge of slowness and inertness, and the charge will be made most positively by those who are the least qualified to form a correct judgment in the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>Public opinion &mdash; that is, contemporaneous public opinion &mdash; is not of any great value on a question like this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>Ignorance and prejudice are both obstacles in the way to a correct understanding of military measures and military men. A battle won is a fact which all can understand; but comparatively few are competent to determine how much merit is due, <pb id="p.360" n="360"/>or rather how little blame should be attached, to the general who has had the misfortune to lose a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>Upon a charge of slowness and over-cautiousness <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0013.00360.01496" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has a right to be tried by his peers,--that is, by the officers of the regular army, and especially by those who have served under him. To their judgment he can confidently appeal, and by their verdict he is ready to stand or fall.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>Indecision and unreadiness are, no doubt, defects of mind or infirmities of temperament, arising from not having any plans of conduct, or from not carrying them out with promptness In either case, they are traits which taint the whole being, and lay their paralyzing touch upon all the currents of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>A sluggish, dawdling, and dilatory man may have spasms of activity, but he never acts continuously and consecutively with energetic quickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>When in a commanding general we see a campaign, or a military enterprise, marked by rapidity of movement, by plans promptly formed and vigorously executed, and when in the same man we see at another time pauses, delays, which bring upon him the reproach of slowness, it is fair to infer that his conduct in the latter case is the result of a cautious and far-seeing wisdom, which comprehends all the difficulties of the position, and knows that the more haste the less speed, so far as the matter in hand is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>The evidence as to <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> is important in an issue like this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>Let us apply these principles to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0013.00360.01497" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s military career.

<p>In the first place, no <num value="1">one</num> has ever pretended, no <num value="1">one</num> can pretend, that he is a military commander who acts without previously-formed plans, without having determined beforehand what he shall do and how he shall do it. On the contrary, he is peculiarly and singularly thoughtful of the future, carefully meditating every step of his progress, and vigilant in providing against all possible contingencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>Upon this point the evidence is irresistible and overwhelming.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>But, say <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0013.00361.01498" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s assailants and detractors, though his plans are judicious and carefully formed, he lacks quickness and vigor in carrying them out; he is slow in the saddle; he does not take time by the forelock; he lets opportunities slip by which never come a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>But what is the evidence to support these charges?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>Look at his campaign in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>,--a part of his military career conveniently ignored by his enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>Here he had a separate command, a defined field of action, and was not hampered and trammelled by interference from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>; and do we see any signs of indecision and want of promptness here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>On the contrary, we observe the happiest combination of judgment in design and vigor in execution: <num value="1">one</num> skilful and powerful blow was instantly followed by another, and the result was absolute and permanent military success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>Then look at the brilliant and crowded period between the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> days of <dateStruct value="1862-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>On the former of these dates, the forces in and around <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> were little better <pb id="p.362" n="362"/>than a tumultuary and disorganized mob; and within <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>, as if at the touch of a magician's wand, they were converted into an effective and disciplined army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>Within a fortnight from the time of their leaving <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, they had marched <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure>, fought <num value="2">two</num> battles, gained <num value="2">two</num> victories, driven out of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> a foe flushed with recent success, given a sense of security to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, and raised the spirits of every patriot in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>Was there any time lost here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>Is there any evidence here of want of decision, want of energy, want of promptness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>Surely not, but all the reverse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>But all this is neutralized and made of no effect because, after the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs>, he did not cross the <rs>Potomac</rs>, pursue <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0065.0013.00362.01499" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:3"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s retreating army, and utterly destroy it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>Nothing but ignorance or prejudice, <num value="1">one</num> or both, could make this delay a ground for disparaging <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0065.0013.00362.01500" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s military reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>Are we to suppose that the man who for <measure n="15days" type="date">fifteen days</measure> had been acting with the most extraordinary energy and vigor was suddenly so paralyzed, so smitten with procrastination, that he folded up his hands, went to sleep, and from mere indolence forbore to gather the new laurels which were within reach of his hand if he had only stretched it out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>Such sudden change is inconsistent with the laws of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>Men are not <num value="1">one</num> week brimful of fiery energy and the next eaten up by the rust of inaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>The pause made after the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs> must be interpreted by the fortnight of crowded and intense action which <pb id="p.363" n="363"/>preceded it; and to an unprejudiced and instructed mind it is vindicated by the soundest military reasoning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>But he failed to take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, it is said.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>All nations have days sacred to the remembrance of joy and of grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>They have thanksgivings for success, fasting and prayers in the hour of humiliation and defeat, triumphs and paeans to greet the living and laurel-crowned victor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>They have obsequies and eulogies for the warrior slain on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>Such is the duty we are to perform to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>The poetry, the histories, the orations of antiquity, all resound with the clang of arms; they dwell rather upon rough deeds of war than the gentle arts of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>They have preserved to us the names of heroes, and the memory of their deeds, even to this distant day. Our own Old Testament teems with the narrations of the brave actions and heroic deaths of <persName n="Jewish,,,,," id="n0065.0014.00375.01539" reg="mostcommon:Jewish,nomatch:0"><surname>Jewish</surname></persName> patriots, while the New Testament of our meek and suffering Saviour often selects the soldier and his weapons to typify and illustrate religious heroism and duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>These stories of the actions of the dead have frequently survived, in the lapse of ages, the names of those whose fall was thus commemorated centuries ago. But, although we know not now the names of all the brave men who fought and fell upon the plain of <persName n="Marathon,,,,," id="n0065.0014.00375.01540" reg="mostcommon:Marathon,nomatch:0"><surname>Marathon</surname></persName>, in the pass of <placeName reg="Thermopylae, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2716872">Thermopylae</placeName>, and on the hills of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 23" reg="asia">Palestine</placeName>, we have not lost the memory of their examples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/>As long as the <pb id="p.376" n="376"/>warm blood courses the veins of man, as long as the human heart beats high and quick at the recital of brave deeds and patriotic sacrifices, so long will the lesson still incite generous men to emulate the heroism of the past.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>Among the <name>Greeks</name>, it was the custom that the fathers of the most valiant of the slain should pronounce the eulogies of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>Sometimes it devolved upon their great statesmen and orators to perform this mournful duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>Would that a new <persName n="Demosthenes,,,,," id="n0065.0014.00376.01541" reg="mostcommon:Demosthenes,nomatch:0"><surname>Demosthenes</surname></persName> or a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="Pericles,,,,," id="n0065.0014.00376.01542" reg="mostcommon:Pericles,nomatch:0"><surname>Pericles</surname></persName> could arise and take my place to-day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>for he would find a theme worthy of his most brilliant powers, of his most touching eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>I stand here now, not as an orator, but as a whilom commander, and in the place of the fathers, of the most valiant dead,--as their comrade, too, on many a hard-fought field against domestic and foreign foe,--in early youth and mature manhood,--moved by all the love that <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> felt when he poured forth his lamentations for the mighty father and son who fell on <placeName reg="Mount Gilboa, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2349283">Mount Gilboa</placeName>. <name n="God" type="God">God</name> knows that <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>'s love for <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> was no more deep than mine for the tried friends of many long and eventful years, whose names are to be recorded upon the structure that is to rise upon this spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>Would that his more than mortal eloquence could grace my lips and do justice to the theme!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>We have met to-day, my comrades, to do honor to our own dead; brothers united to us by the closest and dearest ties, who have freely given their lives for their country in this war,--so just and righteous, so long as its purpose is to crush rebellion and to save our nation from the infinite evils of dismemberment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>Such an occasion as this should call forth the deepest and noblest emotions of our nature,--pride, sorrow, and prayer: pride that our country has possessed such sons; sorrow that she has lost them; prayer that she may have others like them,--that we and our successors may adorn her annals as they have done, and that when our parting hour arrives, whenever and <pb id="p.377" n="377"/>however it may be, our souls may be prepared for the great change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>We have assembled to consecrate a cenotaph, which shall remind our children's children, in the distant future, of their fathers' struggles in the days of the great rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>This monument is to perpetuate the memory of a portion only of those who have fallen for the nation in this unhappy war: it is dedicated to the officers and soldiers of the regular army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>Yet this is done in no class or exclusive spirit, and in the act we remember with reverence and love our comrades of the volunteers, who have so gloriously fought and fallen by our sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>Each State will, no doubt, commemorate in some fitting way the services of its sons who abandoned the avocations of peace and shed their blood in the ranks of the volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>How richly they have earned a nation's love, a nation's gratitude, with what heroism they have confronted death, have wrested victory from a stubborn foe, and have illustrated defeat, it well becomes me to say; for it has been my lot to command them on many a sanguinary field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>I know that I but echo the feeling of the regulars, when I award the high credit they deserve to their brave brethren of the volunteers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>But we of the regular army have no States to look to for the honors due our dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>We belong to the whole country, and can neither expect nor desire the <rs>General Government</rs> to make a perhaps invidious distinction in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>We are few in number, a small band of comrades, united by peculiar and very binding ties; for with many of us our friendships were commenced in boyhood, when we rested here in the shadow of the granite hills which look down upon us where we stand; with others the ties of brotherhood were formed in more mature years, while fighting among the rugged mountains and the fertile valleys of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, within hearing of the eternal waves of the <rs>Pacific</rs>, or in the lonely grandeur of the <pb id="p.378" n="378"/>great plains of the far <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>With all, our love and confidence have been cemented by common dangers and sufferings, on the toilsome march, in the dreary bivouac, amid the clash of arms, and in the presence of death on scores of battle-fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/><placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, with her large heart, adopts us all,--graduates and those appointed from civil life, officers and privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>In her eyes we are all her children, jealous of her fame and eager to sustain her world-wide reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/><rs type="role2">Generals</rs> and private soldiers, men who have cheerfully offered our all for our dear country, we stand here before this shrine, ever hereafter sacred to our dead, equals and brothers in the presence of the common death which awaits us all, perhaps on the same field and at the same hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>Such are the ties which unite us,--the most endearing which exist among men; such the relations which bind us together,--the closest of the sacred brotherhood of arms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>It has therefore seemed, and it is, fitting that we should erect upon this spot, so sacred to us all, an enduring monument to our dear brothers who have preceded us on the path of peril and of honor which it is the destiny of many of us to tread.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>What is this regular army to which we belong?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>Who were the men whose death merits such honors from the living?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>What is the cause for which they have laid down their lives?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3226"/>Our regular or permanent army is the nucleus which, in time of peace, preserves the military traditions of the nation, as well as the organization, science, and instruction indispensable to modern armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>It may be regarded as coeval with the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>It derives its origin from the old continental and State lines of the <name>Revolution</name>, whence, with some interruptions and many changes, it has attained its present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>In fact, we may with propriety go even beyond the <name>Revolution</name> to seek the roots of our <pb id="p.379" n="379"/>genealogical tree in the old <name>French</name> wars; for the cis-Atlantic campaigns of the <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> war were not confined to the <quote>red men scalping each other by the great lakes of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>,</quote> and it was in them that our ancestors <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> participated as <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0065.0014.00379.01543" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> in the large operations of civilized armies.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>The War of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> found the army on a footing far from adequate to the emergency; but it was rapidly increased, and of the new generation of soldiers many proved equal to the requirements of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>Then came an interval of more than <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of external peace, marked by many changes in the organization and strength of the regular army, and broken at times by tedious and bloody <name>Indian</name> wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3237"/>Of these the most remarkable were the <rs>Black Hawk War</rs>, in which our troops met unflinchingly a foe as relentless and far more destructive than the <name>Indians</name>,--that terrible scourge, the cholera; and the tedious Florida War, where for so many <pb id="p.380" n="380"/>years the <name>Seminoles</name> eluded in the pestilential swamps our utmost efforts, and in which were displayed such traits of heroism as that commemorated by yonder monument to <persName n="Dade,,,,," id="n0065.0014.00380.01554" reg="mostcommon:Dade,nomatch:0"><surname>Dade</surname></persName> and his command,--<quote>when all fell, save <num value="3">three</num>, without an attempt to retreat.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>It is of an old man whose long life was gloriously spent in the service of the state as a warrior and a statesman, and who, when his hair was white and his feeble limbs could scarce carry his bent form towards the grave, attained the highest honors that a Venetian citizen could reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>But it is time to approach the present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>In the war which now shakes the land to its foundation, the regular army has borne a most honorable part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>Too few in numbers to act by themselves, regular regiments have participated in every great battle in the <rs>East</rs> and in most of those west of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>History affords no brighter example of honor than that of these brave men, tempted, as I blush to say they were, by some of their former officers, who, having themselves proved false to their flag, endeavored to seduce the men who had often followed them in combat and who had naturally regarded them with respect and love.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/>Soon after the close of the <rs>Revolutionary War</rs>, it was found that the confederacy, which had grown up during that memorable contest, was fast falling to pieces from its own weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>The central power was too weak; it could only recommend to the different States such measures as seemed best; and it possessed no real power to legislate, because it lacked the executive force to compel obedience to its laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>The national credit and self-respect had disappeared, and it was feared by the friends of human liberty throughout the world that ours was but another added to the long list of fruitless attempts at self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>The nation was evidently upon the brink of ruin and dissolution, when, some <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> ago, many of the wisest and most patriotic of the land met to seek a remedy for the great evils which threatened to destroy the great work of the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>Their sessions were long, and often stormy: for a time the most sanguine doubted the possibility of a successful termination to their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>But from amidst the conflict of sectional interests, of party prejudices, and of personal selfishness, the spirit of wisdom and conciliation at length evoked the <rs>Constitution</rs>, under which we have lived so long.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>It was not formed in a day, but was the result of patient labor, of lofty wisdom, and of the purest patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>It was at last adopted by the people of all the <name>States</name>,--although by some reluctantly,--not as being exactly what all desired, but as being the best possible under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>It was accepted as giving us a form of government under which the nation might live happily and prosper, so long as the people should continue to be influenced by the same sentiments which actuated those who formed it, and which would not be liable <pb id="p.388" n="388"/>to destruction from internal causes, so long as the people preserved the recollection of the miseries and calamities which led to its adoption.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>Under this beneficent Constitution the progress of the nation was unexampled in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>The rights and liberties of its citizens were secure at home and abroad; vast territories were rescued from the control of the savage and the wild beast and added to the domain of civilization and the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>The same elements of discordant sectional prejudices, interests, and institutions which had rendered the formation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> so difficult, threatened more than once to destroy it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>Time and long-continued good fortune obliterated the recollection of the calamities and wretchedness of the years preceding the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>Men forgot that conciliation, common interest, and mutual charity had been the foundation and must be the support of our government,--as is, indeed, the case with all governments and all the relations of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>Stripped of all sophistry and side issues, the direct cause of the war, as it presented itself to the honest and patriotic citizens of the <rs>North</rs>, was simply this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>Although the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the actual condition of the government provided them with a peaceable and sure protection against the apprehended evil, they preferred to seek security in the destruction of the government which could protect them, and in the use of force against the national troops holding a national fortress.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>Rebellion against a government like ours, which contains the means of self-adjustment and a pacific remedy for evils, should never be confounded with a revolution against despotic power, which refuses redress of wrongs.
