<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The defeat at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> had demoralized the administration and the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>No <num value="1">one</num> had formed any, the most vague, idea of what was to be done or how to do anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Up to this time the administration had shared with the people of the <rs>North</rs> and an unconsidering press the opinion that the rebellion was but a mob, to be scattered in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> free fights by impetuous onsets of patriotic men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Now the shout, <quote>On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,</quote> had been suddenly and appallingly hushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Paralysis had followed.

The military condition of the whole country, <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> alone excepted, was chaotic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Probably there were other men in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> as well fitted by natural ability and education for the great work in hand, but they did not appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>No other <num value="1">one</num> has been indicated as the proper man for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>That occasion demanded a calm foresight of the vast needs of the country in the coming, the then present, peril, the ability to provide for every <num value="1">one</num> of them, and &mdash; the expression is homely but precise &mdash; the staying power to make the provision perfectly, calmly, completely, unmoved by the cries, however honest and anxious, of an alarmed people, equally unmoved. by the criticisms of the envious and the clamors of the unprincipled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>If the wisdom which sought the ablest military advice in that moment of alarm had been displayed throughout the war by entrusting to military knowledge and ability the conduct of campaigns and the direction and execution of the work of war, the expense of treasure and blood would have been vastly less, and the end would have been much more speedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Instead of this, after <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00003.00021" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had assured the safety of the capital, and the alarm of the civilians had subsided, they assumed the direction, interfered with and delayed military preparations, and undertook the specific management of campaigns and armies, while they took care that the delays and defeats which they caused should be charged on soldiers in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We who were then living can with the utmost difficulty carry our minds back to the conditions under which <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00003.00022" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was called to save the capital and country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It is impossible for the present generation to realize the blindness of the people or appreciate the prevision of the young general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We now look back to all that which he foresaw, foretold, and provided for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>So intense had been popular, feeling that it was regarded: <pb n="4" id="p.4"/>as treason to think or say that secession was in great strength, that the <rs>South</rs> would not be easily conquered,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He was alone in the clear atmosphere, above the scene of physical and political warfare, and saw what others could not or would not see.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He desired to save both, probably believing that the unity of his party was essential to the saving of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In this view can be explained much which is otherwise inexplicable in his dealings with the general, to whom up to the very last he gave the most frank and full private assurances of his confidence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Alone in his outlook, he was alone in the execution of his great work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The fortification of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> accomplished, and a sufficient force organized and disciplined for its defence, he directed his labors to the next great need &mdash; an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The people, the sovereigns, had not the remotest conception of the meaning of the word <quote>army.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Very few soldiers in this country had grasped the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>No <num value="1">one</num> but <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00004.00028" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had observed that the able and educated soldiers of the <rs>South</rs> had long been organizing that vast machine which, once created, moves with irresistible force over all obstacles until met by another machine of like construction and greater power, or which is handled with greater skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> grew like a vast engine constructed by a master-mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Its history is the reward of the constructor, ample, and the only reward he ever received.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> characteristic of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00004.00029" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s mind which some would regard as a defect, and which certainly placed him at a disadvantage in his relations with the men in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He was slow to suspect evil of any man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>This trait was exhibited in his private life, and he never wholly lost it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The philosophic reader will find interest in the indications afforded in his letters of his gradual awakening to the controlling presence in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> of a class of men known as politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Soldiers, accustomed to honest service for definite purposes, imbued with high principles of honor, can with difficulty recognize the existence of men in public life who are willing to manage public interests for private or party gain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He knew the past history of his country by heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He remembered the illustrious names and records of men whose high ambition had been to serve the people as statesmen, whom no <num value="1">one</num> had ever thought to charge with personal or party motive in any of their acts as trustees and representatives of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Was the day of such American senators and representatives gone by?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Was legislation henceforth to be for the perpetuation of hold on office, for the success of party, with the mere pretence of good to country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Now that the general trust of governmental powers had <pb n="5" id="p.5"/>become a specific trust of blood to be poured out and treasure to be expended for the salvation of the <rs>Union</rs>, it did not occur to him that any of the trustees could dream of using that treasure and blood for personal advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>When men professed honest patriotism he believed them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Nor do the people themselves, in times of excitement, yield readily to the belief that among their leaders are some who are not honest and patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But in calm retrospect they are generally more wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It would not be difficult already to make a Catalogue of names of men who were prominent in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and elsewhere during the war, who secured for the time the reputation of patriotic leaders of opinion and directors of events, whose memories have been allowed, as they deserved, to rot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It is impossible to over-estimate the laborious character of the general's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>His whole soul was in his work; his every energy and thought was given to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Out of countless illustrations of this which might be given, let <num value="1">one</num> suffice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">lieutenant-colonel</rs> of that superb regiment, the <orgName type="regiment" key="1CTArtillery">1st Conn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The plan of campaign having been overturned by the reduction of the army, the general formed a new plan and advanced rapidly on it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Again the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> interfered and defeated it, ordering him to stretch his right to the north of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to effect the junction of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00012.00089" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, now promised, but to come overland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The charge was not infrequently made that he intended to seize the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The devotion of the army to him, with their indignation at his and their treatment by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, might arouse apprehension in minds not noted for personal courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It is no secret that this fear prevailed in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> after <dateStruct value="-09-2"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg="2">2</day></dateStruct>, and especially when the final order was sent relieving <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00012.00101" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Possibly such apprehension had something to do with the holding out to the general the idea that he was to command the combined forces, and with the adoption of the plan of withdrawing the army from his command instead of relieving him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>That the <rs>President</rs> had no part in this ultimate purpose can hardly be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>He honestly desired to see an army always between <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and the enemy, nor did he or <persName n="Stanton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00012.00102" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> learn till years afterward, when <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00012.00103" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:4"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was south of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the military truth which <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00012.00104" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> reiterated, that the true defence of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was on the bank of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It is hardly worth while now to say that if any such fears prevailed among the men in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> it was because they could not realize the possible existence of such an upright, pure, and unselfish servant of his country as <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00012.00105" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The commander who had for months been the victim of political intrigues, baffled in every effort to serve his country, ordered against his judgment and protest hither and thither by ignorant and inimical superiors, the general loving and loved by a great army now removed from his command, sat, or paced to and fro, with a little group of staff officers and a few wounded veterans around him in his tent, listening in anxiety beyond words to the sound of distant cannon firing on his old troops, and was even compelled to ask the password for the night from the <rs type="role" reg="military-Governor">military governor</rs> of the small city in whose outskirts his tent was pitched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>His personal enemies had triumphed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The war was now to be very long and very bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>They had effected his disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The defeated army of the <rs>Union</rs> was rushing homeward in broken masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>An exultant enemy was marching on the capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Frightened at the awful catastrophe they had caused, the politicians disappeared from sight and were not seen or heard by the people again until, with recovered breath, in assured safety, they reopened their attack on the general toward whom, for the time, all eyes in the land were directed as the only possible saviour of his country.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The people, in the person of their <rs type="role2">President</rs>, who alone in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> preserved sound judgment and a serene mind, went to the lately insulted and displaced general, and, with tears not unfitting the occasion (for his tears were the emotion of a betrayed and outraged nation), asked him to forget his wrongs and save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The falsehood was afterward circulated that he hesitated and sought to make conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>He accepted the new responsibility instantly, for every <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> was of priceless value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>He saved the arsenal which cowardice would have destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The wild scene of joy with which the army received him can never be the subject of the artist's pencil, for it was in the darkness of night, among the <rs>Virginia</rs> forests, when the good horse of the general, accompanied by <num value="1">one</num> faithful aide, the gallant <rs>Colburn</rs>, brought him at that tremendous pace the soldiers knew, to meet them retreating, gloomy as the black night that lay on the hills around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>How many votes he received will never be known, for the <quote>count</quote> was in the hands of those who had not scrupled to defeat him in battles with the enemies of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>He had not expected to be elected, and the result was a great relief to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>But the bitterness of political enmity followed him into private life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>In each case he ascertained that the offer was made by a majority over a minority who had strong prejudices against him and opposed his appointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Acceptance was impossible to him under such circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The demand of his old comrades and friends became so pressing that he at last consented to receive a procession on a designated evening a few days in advance, provided it should be spontaneous, without previous advertisement in newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>He expected a few <num value="100">hundred</num> old soldiers and friends, and an affair of a few minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Instead he received the most impressive ovation which has ever been given to a private citizen of this country, perhaps not excepting those in times of the highest political excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>There was what men call a magnetism about him which won all hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>To politicians such a man, honest and unapproachable, is always a subject of apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Party politicians, <rs n="Democrats" type="political">Democrats</rs> as well as <rs n="Republicans" type="political">Republicans</rs>, feared him as a possible rival or opponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>And here it may be added that his experience had taught him to recognize the party politician whenever he came in contact with <num value="1">one</num>, and to estimate him at his precise worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>He had accepted the governorship, urged on him as an opportunity of doing good service to his State; but he was glad when the end of his term of office came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>He had resolved to pass the remainder of his life as a private citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>His ample knowledge of modern languages made him at home in all countries, and enabled him to accumulate stores of information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>A sharp attack of the same acute pain suddenly seized him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The physician summoned to his side administered remedies, but the agony continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>He left his bed for a large chair in which he sat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>No expression of suffering escaped him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>On the contrary, he spoke only cheerfully and pleasantly to the servants whom he was sorry to call up, and to his wife and daughter, to whom he once in a while addressed a bright word of affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The next moment his head rested on the chair-back and the good soldier was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The rewards which are withheld here, whether by reason of the malice of enemies or the neglect of friends, are of no account there.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Most public men live <num value="2">two</num> lives &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> that which the people see, the other that which none see unless it be a few intimate friends and companions of hours of freedom.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Whatever be their judgment of the soldier and statesman, few if any <pb n="18" id="p.18"/>outside of the circle of his intimate friends have had any idea of the real man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Public men are too often measured by the familiar standards of public life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>He was a man such as we seldom know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>His experiences in life were varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Educated as a soldier, he had devoted his life to his profession, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the most accomplished military scholars of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>His military library was large, in various languages, always increasing, every book thoroughly studied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>He continued these studies faithfully to his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Military operations in every part of the world commanded his close observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>He supplied himself with maps and all information in current literature, followed movements of armies, kept himself familiar with every phase of campaigns, whether in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in Afghanistan, in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, or in <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">South Africa</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>While this was his professional study, he occupied himself with almost equally thorough study of subjects very &mdash; remote from military matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>He was a general student of the literature of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>He read freely most of the languages of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and kept up with the progress of thought and discussion in history, philosophy, and art.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>He was especially interested in archeology, and, having all his life retained and used his knowledge of ancient languages, found abundant delight in reading archaeologic publications and in following the work of explorers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>In all departments of scholarly reading, he was constant and unwearying, and he never forgot what he had once learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Fitted by his attainments for the society of the learned, he had the marked characteristic of the true scholar &mdash; the desire to know more, and therefore the habit of seeking instead of offering information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Few suspected his mastery of subjects on which he only asked questions when thrown in contact with recognized masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>In general conversation he more frequently sought information than gave it; but when drawn out to give it his expression was concise, vigorous, clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>His extended knowledge of ancient and modern languages made him master of his own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>His public papers are models of pure style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>His habit of writing was swift, and he never hesitated for the precise word to express the exact shade of meaning he intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>His despatch-books, containing the autograph originals of his despatches during the war, are marvels, since, with whatever haste he wrote, he wrote without erasure or alteration on subjects where each word was of vital importance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>That his life was <num value="1">one</num> of constant occupation may be judged from what has been said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>He had no idle hours &mdash; for those cannot be called idle which were given to social duties and the enjoyments of that home life whose beauty and happiness were perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>His wife and children were his companions, and a perpetual sunshine was in the household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>He was full of cheer, life, vigor, always ready for whatever would make any <num value="1">one</num> of them happy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>And this leads me to say that of all men I have ever known <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00018.00118" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was the most unselfish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Neither in his public life nor in his private life did he ever seek anything for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>He was constantly doing something for some <num value="1">one</num> else; always seeking to do good, confer pleasure, relieve sorrow, gratify a whim, do something for another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>He had his own <pb n="19" id="p.19"/>amusements, but in those he sought the good of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It grew with years on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>On his it was a marked trait of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>He would make great sacrifices of his own pleasure and comfort to render a service to any <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>They were a vast family, and not a few of them came to him for aid in distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>None came in vain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>His charity was abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>He sympathized with every <num value="1">one</num> who was in trouble or sorrow; and his sympathy was practical and useful, for his person and his purse were devoted to its uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>When she came back she told her story to the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>She found her way to the battle-field, and after a while to the graves where some <num value="1">one</num> told her the men of her brother's regiment were buried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It was a lonesome place above ground then, for the army had moved away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>She was searching among the graves for a familiar name on the stakes. when she saw, riding down the road which passed at some distance from the burial place, what she called a lot of soldiers on horseback.

<p>It is surely unnecessary to say that he was a gentleman in every sense of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>In social life he was perfectly simple in his manner, wholly unaffected, always genial, having rare conversational powers with all classes of persons, devoutly respectful to ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>This deference to the female sex was a marked characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>I note an illustration of it which I find in many of his private letters, some in this volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>When at the head of the army, and occupying a position only <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to the <rs>President</rs>, he received <num value="1000">thousands</num> of visitors who came from mere curiosity, introduced by senators or others, to see the young general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>In mentioning such visits he invariabry says that he <quote>was presented to the ladies</quote> --never uses what would have been a perfectly correct expression under the circumstances: <quote>the ladies were presented to me.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>In person <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00020.00120" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> <measure n="9inches" type="distance">nine inches</measure> tall, with great breadth of shoulders and solid, not superfluous, muscle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>He measured <measure n="45inches" type="distance">forty-five inches</measure> around the chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>His physical strength in his younger life was very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>He seldom exerted it in later years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>He contracted disease in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war which never wholly left him, and which doubtless somewhat impaired his strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>But in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> I have seen him bend <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>-dollar over the end of his thumb by pressure between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> finger of his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>That same evening we were sitting together, <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was a distinguished officer who weighed over <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num>. <quote>They tell me, general,</quote> said I, <quote>that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00020.00121" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> can throw you over his head.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/><quote>So they say,</quote> was the somewhat uncertain response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/><quote>Let me alone, general!</quote> he exclaimed-<quote>let me alone!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>He can do it &mdash; he has done it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>He can toss me in his arms like a baby.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>To the very last day of his life his step was quick, firm, elastic, the expression of that uniform cheerfulness, bouyancy, and enjoyment of life which he possessed and which he always communicated to those around him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>I think I shall be understood in saying that his physical bearing was such that of all men he was the very last with whom those who knew him could connect any thought of death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>I have left to the last to speak of the controlling feature of McClcl-<persName n="Ian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00020.00123" reg="mostcommon:Ian,nomatch:0"><surname>Ian</surname></persName>'s character and life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>His religion was deep, earnest, practical; not vague or ill-defined to himself or others, not obtrusive, but outspoken when occasion required, and, when outspoken, frank and hearty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>For it was part and parcel of his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>I must use brief words, and I seek to make them distinct, in defining his creed, which was clear as crystal, more steadfast than the hills &mdash; the faith once delivered to the saints in its pure simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>With his intellectual powers, which were of the highest. and with his heart, which was supremely gentle, as trustful all his life as any child's, he was servant and follower of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00020.00124" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, in whom he believed as <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">God</name>, of <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>In all his life, public and private, every purpose was formed, every act done in the light of that faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>It was this which not only produced in him that stainless purity of walk and conversation which all who knew him <pb n="21" id="p.21"/>recognized, but also gave him strength for all the great works of a great life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>It was this which created that magnetic power so often spoken of, won to him that marvellous devotion of his soldiers, made all who knew him regard him with affection, those who knew him best love him most.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Out of the private correspondence which has come into my hands I have selected, and venture to make public here, <num value="2">two</num> letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>These, better than anything I can say, will serve to open, for those who only knew him as a public man, a view of that inner life &mdash; his real life &mdash; which he lived among his familiar friends: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>I was very glad to see those <quote>leaning-back</quote> characters once more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Some few years ago I saw &mdash; near <placeName><persName n="Alsop,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00021.00129" reg="mostcommon:Alsop,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Alsop</surname></persName>'s office</placeName> &mdash; a ship named for me, probably the same you saw the other day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>I fancy <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>, that we will never reach that <quote>land where it is always afternoon</quote> in any ship built by mortal hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Our fate is to work, and still to work, as long as there is any work left in us; and I do not doubt that it is best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>For I can't help thinking that, when me reach that other and far better land, we shall still have work to do throughout the long ages, only we will then see, as we go on, that it is all done for the <rs>Master</rs> and under His own eye; and we will like it, and never grow weary of it, as we often do here when we don't clearly see to what end me are working, and our work brings us in contact with all sorts of men and things not pleasant to rub against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>I suppose that the more we work here the better we shall be trained for that other work, which, after all, is the great end towards which we move, or ought to be moving.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Well, I did not start out to sermonize, but somehow or other your letter started my thoughts in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>I <hi rend="italics">would</hi> like to take the <quote>belongings</quote> and sail for that quiet land; but we will have to wait some little time yet, and I suppose each <num value="1">one</num> will reach it alone, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrived wait for the others.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>In editing this volume for the press I have tried to do that which my friend would approve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The discretion which he gave me was ample.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>I have exercised it by omissions, not by changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Of course his work was unfinished when he left it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Living prepared for the call whenever it might come, serving <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">God</name> as he had served his country, always ready for whatever command he might receive, it is nevertheless certain that, when the order came to go to duty in another life, he was not expecting it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>In writing his memoirs he had made no haste to complete them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Probably had he lived to extreme old age there would still have been much to be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>For years after the civil war he declined to write anything about it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>He had no anxieties for himself and his own reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>An abiding faith in time and the calm judgment of his country kept him from any care about the misstatements, misrepresentations, and falsehoods of which he, more perhaps than any American who had lived before him, excepting <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, had been made the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Besides, he always gave less thought to himself and his own reputation than any man I ever knew or heard of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>He was a man of very deep feeling, with the passions of all ardent souls; but so absolute had become his habitual self-control and subjection of all passionate resentment, so complete the self-abnegation which characterized him, I can affirm with certainty that he always felt more sorrow for the man who maligned him than for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Once when I showed him a slander, a pure fabrication, which had been published on the authority of <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00022.00134" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,A.,E.,,:4"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, he read it, laid down the magazine with a quiet laugh, said, <quote>Poor burn!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>He didn't know what he was saying,</quote> and, after a few kindly words about his old friend, dropped the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>In vain was he urged to publish the demonstrations he possessed of the falsehood of this and similar attacks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>His happiness in life consisted in what he was always doing for others, without thought of self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>As he had never sought position, command, or promotion, so he never asked his countrymen to give him honor or thanks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>It was only when I urged on him that his children had a right to possess his own story that he took the subject into consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Afterward, while in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, he began to write out personal reminiscences, which from time to time he continued after his return to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>A fire destroyed all his manuscript.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>In <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct> he resumed the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>He did not labor at it continuously, with intent to produce a book, but wrote as the humor seized him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>His Report, made in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, but held back by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> for some months, had been full, accurate, and exhaustive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>It was published in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>. No statement in it has ever been controverted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>This Report did not include any accounts of his personal relations to the civilians who <pb n="23" id="p.23"/>directed the course of political events and misdirected military operations during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>These accounts he wrote, accompanying them with letters, despatches, documents &mdash; whatever might throw light on history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>He rewrote and extended a large part of the military history &mdash; which his Report had given in brief, and from time to time inserted pages of manuscript here and there in those parts of it which he had not rewritten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Thus as years passed he was extending and annotating a history, at all times complete in itself as a narrative; and, however long he had lived, would probably have enriched it from year to year with more and more of interesting material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>His sudden death interrupted the progress of his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>When I came to examine the collected and arranged papers which he entrusted to me, verbally while living, and by his last will, I found not only the narrative which I have styled <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00023.00135" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s own story, but sufficient illustrative and explanatory documents, letters, and despatches to form several volumes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>He had not written with reference to publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>It was expressly for his children that he was preparing his memoirs, and there was a great deal in them which was intended solely for their eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>A century hence every word, perhaps, might be interesting to those who enjoy personal memoirs, but, as a matter of course, it has been my duty to withhold such portions as I think he would not have published now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>I have exercised my discretion in reserving for future publication much of the material he had arranged, which would now be valuable, and doubtless acceptable, but would have extended this volume to a series of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>All the foot-notes in the volume are mine.</p> 
<p>Another class of material came into my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00023.00136" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had been married only a few months before the outbreak of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Not the least sacrifice which he made in entering the service was the breaking up of the home &mdash; his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> home &mdash; in which he had found the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> happiness of a laborious life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>Sometimes during his public service <persName n="McClellan,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00023.00137" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was able to be with him, especially while he was in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>When they were separated he found his only rest and refreshment in writing to her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>The perfection of their love, the absolute confidence which he reposed, and wisely reposed, in her, made his letters not only graphic accounts of daily events, great and small, but an exposure of his inmost feelings I found among his papers some extracts from these letters, which he had made to aid him in writing his memoirs; but the letters were supposed to have vanished in the fire.

My residence was then in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, and the fact that I had been in the army threw me in contact with the leading men of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>My old army associations had placed me in intimate relations with many Southern men, and I had travelled much in the <rs>South</rs>, so that I was, perhaps, better prepared to weigh the situation than the majority of Northern men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>So strongly was I convinced that war would ensue that when, in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, I leased a house in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> for the term of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, I insisted upon a clause in the lease releasing me from the obligation in the event of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>The general current of events during the winter, and many special instances of outrage or insult offered to unoffending Northern travellers in the <rs>Southwest</rs> (coming to my knowledge as a railway official), reduced this impression to a certainty in my mind, even before the firing upon <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>After all that has been said and written upon the subject, I suppose none now doubt that slavery was the real knot of the question and the underlying cause of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>It is now easy to perceive how the war might have been avoided if for <num value="2">two</num> or <pb n="30" id="p.30"/><num value="3">three</num> generations back all the men of both sections had been eminently wise, calm, unselfish, and patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>But with men as they are, it would be difficult indeed to indicate how a permanent pacific solution could have been reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>It is no doubt true that events were precipitated, perhaps rendered inevitable, by the violent course of a comparatively small number of men, on both sides of the line, during the <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> preceding the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>But it is the distinct lesson of history that this is always so; that the great crises in the world's history are induced by the words and actions of a few earnest or violent men, who stir up the masses and induce them blindly to follow their lead, whether for good or evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>As a rule the masses of civilized men, if left to themselves, are not prone to disturb the existing order of things or to resort to violent measures, unless suffering under intense evils which come home to each man individually and affect either his personal safety or personal possessions and prosperity; and even in such cases spontaneous uprisings of the masses are rare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>In our own case the people of the <num value="2">two</num> sections did not understand each other before the war, and probably neither section regarded the other as seriously in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>The wide difference existing in social organization and habits had much to do with this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>In the <rs>South</rs> the habit of carrying, and using on slight provocation, deadly weapons, the sparse settlement of the country, the idle and reckless habits of the majority of the illiterate whites, the self-assertion natural to the dominant race in a slave-holding country, all conspired to impress them with an ill-founded assumption of superior worth and courage over the industrious, peaceful, law-abiding Northerners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>On the other hand, the men of the <rs>North</rs> had become somewhat habituated to the boastful assertions too common among the <name>Southerners</name>, and had learned to believe that no real purpose of using force lay concealed beneath their violent language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Both were mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>The <rs>Southerner</rs>, with all his gasconading, was earnest in his intention to fight to the last for slavery and the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>The peaceful <rs>Northerner</rs>, unaccustomed to personal warfare and prone to submit his disputes to the regular ordeal of law, was ready to lay down his life for the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/><pb n="31" id="p.31"/></p> 
<p>More gallant foes never met on the field of battle than these men of the same race, who had so long lived under the ample folds of the same flag; more desperate battles were never fought than those now about to occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>The military virtues of patriotism, patience, endurance, self-abnegation, and heroism were about to receive their most striking illustrations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>In judging the motives of men at this great crisis it must be remembered that the vast majority of Southern men had been educated in the doctrine of secession and of extreme State-rights &mdash; which is, that allegiance was due <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the <rs>State</rs>, next to the general government, and that the <rs>State</rs> when it entered the <rs>Union</rs> retained the right to withdraw at will; while in the <rs>North</rs> the doctrine was generally held that allegiance to the general government was paramount and the <rs>Union</rs> indissoluble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The masses on each side were honest in their belief as to the justice of their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Their honesty and sincerity were proved by the sacrifices they made, by the earnestness with which so many devout Christians on both sides confidently relied upon the aid of <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">God</name> in their hour of trial, and by the readiness with which so many brave men laid down their lives on the field of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>When the generation which took part in this contest shall have passed away, and the question can be regarded in the cold light of dispassionate historical and philosophical inquiry, it will be clearly seen that in this case also history has repeated itself, and that the truth lay midway between the extreme positions assumed by the controlling spirits at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>The right of secession would virtually have carried us back to the old Confederacy, which proved so weak from lack of cohesion between its parts and of the necessary force in the executive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The tendency of Northern <rs n="Republicans" type="political">Republicans</rs> was towards a centralized power, under which the autocracy of the <name>States</name> would disappear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>It is impossible for any government to recognize the right of secession unless its assertion is supported by such overwhelming force as to render opposition entirely hopeless, and thus practically convert rebellion into successful revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>There can be no stability, no protection of person and property, no good government, no power to put down disorder at home or to resist oppression from without, under any other principle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>On the other hand, in a country so vast as ours, with such <pb n="32" id="p.32"/>great differences of topography and of climate, with a population so numerous and derived from such a variety of sources, and, in consequence of all this, such diversities of habits, local laws, and material interests, it is impossible for a centralized government to legislate satisfactorily for all the domestic concerns of the various parts of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>The only safe policy is that the general government be strictly confined to the general powers and duties vested in it by the old Constitution, while the individual States preserve all the sovereign rights and powers retained by them when the constitutional compact was formed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>As a corollary from this I am convinced that no State can be deprived of any of these retained rights, powers, and duties without its own consent; and that the power of amending the <rs>Constitution</rs> was intended to apply only to amendments affecting the manner of carrying into effect the original provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but not to enable the general government to seize new power at the expense of any unwilling State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>A strict adherence in practice to this theory presents, in my opinion, the only possibility of the permanent maintenance of our Union throughout the long years of the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The old Southern doctrine of extreme State-rights, including that of secession, would reduce the <rs>Union</rs> to a mere rope of sand, and would completely paralyze the general government, rendering it an object of just contempt at home and abroad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The doctrine of centralization, if carried to its legitimate conclusions, in substituting the legislation of the general government for that of the <name>States</name> in regard to the local and domestic affairs of the people, would soon cause so much discontent and suffering as to result in a resort to secession as the only practical remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>And in this case the <rs>Union</rs> could only be maintained by the superior force of a strong military central government, thus rendering the <rs>Union</rs> valueless for its great object of securing the liberties of the people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>In the course of my narrative the fact will appear &mdash; a fact well known to all who intelligently followed the events of the time-that, at the beginning of the great civil war, the general government was powerless, both in the <name>East</name> and <name>West</name>, to maintain its rights and vindicate its authority, and that the means to accomplish these vital ends were furnished by the individual States, <pb n="33" id="p.33"/>acting in their capacity as sovereigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The history of that period is the best possible vindication of the <rs>Northern</rs> doctrine of State-rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>And no impartial observer of the events of the war can fail to see that all the subsequent violations of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and of the rights of the loyal States, by the general government, were not only wholly unnecessary but positively pernicious at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The safety of the republic at no time during the war required or justified any departure from the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>That great instrument was broad enough to cover even the necessities of that most eventful period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The loyalty of the great masses of the <rs>Northern</rs> people was so marked and so strong that they could be trusted far more than most of the selfish servants whom a minority had placed in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The happiest condition of affairs for us would no doubt be found in a return to the situation before the war, when the action of the general government, being strictly confined to its legitimate purposes, was so little felt by individual citizens that they almost forgot its existence, and were almost unaware that there was any other government in the land than those of the <name>States</name> and municipalities,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Soon after my arrival in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> I had several interviews with prominent abolitionists &mdash; of whom <persName n="Sumner,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00033.00144" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Edwin,V.,,:3"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num>--on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>I invariably took the ground that I was thoroughly opposed to slavery, regarding it as a great evil, especially to the whites of the <rs>South</rs>, but that in my opinion no sweeping measure of emancipation should be carried out, unless accompanied by arrangements providing for the new relations between employers and employed, carefully guarding the rights and interests of both; and that were such a measure framed to my satisfaction I would cordially support it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/><persName n="Sumner,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00033.00145" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Edwin,V.,,:3"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> replied &mdash; others also agreed with him &mdash; that such points did not concern us, and that all that must be left to take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>My reply was that no real statesman could ever contemplate so sweeping and serious a measure as sudden and general emancipation without looking to the future and providing for its consequences; that <num value="4.5">four and a half</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of uneducated slaves should not suddenly be manumitted without due precautions taken both to protect them and to guard against them; that just there was the point where we differed radically and probably irreconcilably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/><pb n="34" id="p.34"/></p> 
<p>My own view was that emancipation should be accomplished gradually, and that the negroes should be fitted for it by certain preparatory steps in the way of education, recognition of the rights of family and marriage, prohibition against selling them without their own consent, the freedom of those born after a certain date, etc.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>I was always prepared to make it <num value="1">one</num> of the essential conditions of peace that slavery should be abolished within a fixed and reasonable period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Had the arrangements of the terms of peace been in my hands I should certainly have insisted on this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>During the autumn of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, after arriving in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, I discontinued the practice of returning fugitive slaves to their owners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>In <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, after <persName n="Pegram,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00034.00146" reg="mostcommon:Pegram,John,,,:2"><surname>Pegram</surname></persName>'s surrender, when I had been directed to parole the prisoners, I collected the large number of negro slaves captured with their masters, and gave them their choice as <hi rend="italics">to</hi> returning with the latter, remaining in camp under pay as laborers, or going North.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>With <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions they decided to return with their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>From that time forward I never returned a negro slave to his master, although many such requisitions were made on me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>I followed the principle that there could be no slave in my camp.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>On the <name type="place">Peninsula</name> I not only received all negroes who came to the camps, but (especially when on the <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.175 000000.3506	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.175 000000.3506	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName>) frequently sent out parties to bring in negroes, because I required them for certain work around the camps and depots too severe for white men in that climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>They were employed upon police work, loading and unloading transports, etc., and sometimes upon entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>They were fed and received some small wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>As a rule much strictness was necessary to make them work; they supposed that in leaving their masters they left all labor behind them, and that they would be clothed, fed, and allowed to live in idleness in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>That was their only idea of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>It was very clear that they were entirely unfit for sudden emancipation and the reception of the electoral franchise, and should have been gradually prepared for it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>While on this subject I must say that, although I was a strong Democrat of the <name>Stephen</name> A. <placeName reg="Douglas school">Douglas school</placeName>, I had no personal political ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>I knew nothing about <quote>practical politics,</quote> had never even voted except for <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00034.00147" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, and during the whole <pb n="35" id="p.35"/>period of my command I never did or wrote anything, or abstained from doing or writing anything, in view of its political effect upon myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>My ambition was fully gratified by the possession of the command of the army, and, so long as I held that, nothing would have induced me to give it up for the <name>Presidency</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Whenever I wrote anything of a political nature it was only with the hope of doing something towards the maintenance of those political principles which I honestly thought should control the conduct of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>In fact, I sacrificed my own interests rather than acquiesce in what I thought wrong or impolitic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> and his advisers made a great mistake in supposing that I desired political advancement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Many of the <rs>Democratic</rs> leaders did me great harm by using my name for party purposes without my knowledge or consent; and, without intending it, probably did more than my armed enemies in the way of ruining my military career by giving the administration some reason to suppose that in the event of military success I might prove a dangerous political rival.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Regarding, as I did, the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> and preservation of the national life to be the great object of the war, I would, no doubt, have acquiesced in any honorable measure absolutely necessary to bring about the desired result, even to the forcible and general abolition of slavery, if found to be a military necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>I recognized the fact that as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had chosen to resort to the arbitrament of arms, they must abide by the logical consequences of the stern laws of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>But, as I always believed that we should fight to bring them back into the <rs>Union</rs>, and should treat them as members of the <rs>Union</rs> when so brought back, I held that it was a matter of sound policy to do nothing likely to render ultimate reconciliation and harmony impossible, unless such a course were imperative to secure military success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>Nor do I now believe that my ideas were quixotic or impracticable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Since the war I have met many of my late antagonists, and have found none who entertained any personal enmity against me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>I remember very well, when riding over the field of <placeName reg="South Mountain, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681169">South Mountain</placeName>, that, passing by a severely wounded <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName>, I dismounted and spoke with him, asking whether I could do anything to relieve him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Such things happened to me not unfrequently, and I confess that it gave me no little pleasure to find that my antagonists shared the feelings of my own men for me.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>If left to their own cool judgment it is probable that the majority of the <rs>Southern</rs> whites would have realized that slavery could not exist much longer, and that their wisest course was to recognize that fact, consent that it should not be extended beyond its existing limits, and provide for its gradual extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>But, for various reasons, more reckless counsels prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>The Southern States rallied to the support of their peculiar institution, declared it to be a holy ordinance, demanded that it might be extended over the <name type="place">Territories</name>, and bitterly opposed the idea that general manumission should be provided for in any form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Thus a state of feeling arose, more particularly in the <rs>South</rs>, which could only be quieted by the drastic methods of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>In the early part of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, as has already been stated, it became almost impossible for any Northern man to travel in the <rs>Southwest</rs> without being subjected to gross insults or to personal maltreated; this conduct soon produced a counter irritation, and, as for myself, I confess that ere long I came to the conclusion that there was but <num value="1">one</num> way to put an end to such proceedings, and that the sooner we entered upon that way the better it would be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>For men who thought as I did there was but <num value="1">one</num> course open.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>It was clear that, even if a peaceable separation were arranged, we would soon come to blows on some secondary issue, such as boundaries, the division of public property, the slavery question on the borders, the free navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, the territorial domain, etc., etc., and in that view it was better <pb n="38" id="p.38"/>to throw everything else to <num value="1">one</num> side and fight upon the main underlying issue &mdash; the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> and the observance of the laws of the general government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>It is perhaps hardly worth while to notice here any of those unfounded slanders which some papers uttered concerning me &mdash; that is, the statement that at the outbreak of the war I entertained offers to enter the <rs>Southern</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>I need only say that there was not the shadow of a foundation for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>The leading men on the <rs>Southern</rs> side knew perfectly well that of all men I would be the last to waver in my allegiance to the general government and its flag.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>At no period, either before or after the war broke out, did any <num value="1">one</num> suggest to me, either directly or indirectly, the idea of my taking part with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>No <num value="1">one</num> ever made me any offer to join the rebel service; no <num value="1">one</num> ever suggested the possibility of my dreaming of espousing that side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>I never, in any manner, intimated to any <num value="1">one</num> that it would be possible for me to take any other side than that of the general government and the <rs>Union</rs>, nor did such a thought ever pass through my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>I always stated distinctly that, should the apprehended crisis arrive, I should stand by the <rs>Union</rs> and the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>I make this record because there have been people so foolish as to believe the statements made by radical newspapers to the effect that I had offered my services to the secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Those papers must have known their statements to be entirely false and void of foundation, when they made them for the sole purpose of serving party political ends.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>How soon the work of organizing and instructing troops began <pb n="39" id="p.39"/>in the <rs>South</rs> will appear from the fact that as early as the <dateStruct value="1861-01-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="01">Jan.</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> an expedition for the relief of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was turned back by the fire of the <rs>Southern</rs> batteries near the entrance of <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>In brief, at least from the beginning of <dateStruct value="1861-01-"><month reg="01">Jan.</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and probably in many cases yet earlier, the work of organizing, arming, and instructing troops began throughout the seceded States, and not improbably in such of the slaveholding States also as had not yet formally joined the movement of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>As early as <dateStruct value="-02-18"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg="18">18</day></dateStruct>, <persName n="Twiggs,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00039.00163" reg="mostcommon:Twiggs,Gen,D.,E.,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Twiggs</surname></persName> surrendered the forces under his command in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Meanwhile neither the general government nor the <rs>Northern States</rs> were doing anything to counteract this movement and meet the impending storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Not only were there no additional troops raised, no steps taken to organize and arm the militia and volunteers, but, so far as the general government was concerned, the authorities seemed to dread even the semblance of a movement to reinforce the few forts still in their possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The little regular army, scattered over the vast area of the <rs>West</rs>, was left without orders, and not even concentrated for self-defence, much less brought in where its services might be available against the active forces of the secessionists, as common prudence would have suggested, as early as the passage of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> ordinance of secession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Such was the condition of affairs when <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> surrendered on the <dateStruct value="1861-04-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>. The general government and the <rs>Northern States</rs> were utterly unprepared for war; not a man enlisted, not a musket procured, not a cartridge made, not a piece of clothing or equipment provided, beyond those maintained during a state of profound and apparently permanent peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The Southern States for nearly <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> had been actively preparing for the eventuality they intended to force on, and had made no little headway in the collection of material, the organization and instruction of troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Moreover, on the breaking-out of hostilities they possessed another and very considerable advantage over the <name>Northerners</name>: that is to say, <num value="1">one</num> of the results of the peculiar institution of the <rs>South</rs> was that the class of slaveholders, the highly educated <pb n="40" id="p.40"/>whites, had always composed an aristocracy, which furnished the social and political leaders to whom the poor whites were, as a rule, accustomed to defer, so that when the time arrived to raise troops the aristocratic class furnished officers always accustomed to control, and the poor whites furnished the mass of the private soldiers, always habituated to that deference to their leaders which under the new circumstances rapidly passed into obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Discipline was thus very easily established among them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Among the <rs>Northern</rs> men there was little difficulty in establishing discipline when the officers were intelligent gentlemen; but, in the early part of the war particularly, it occurred that the officers were sometimes inferior in intelligence and education to the soldiers, and in these cases the establishment of discipline presented far greater difficulties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>Here let me say that, given good officers, there are no men in the world who admit of a more thorough and effective discipline than the native-born <rs n="American people" type="group">Americans</rs> of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Their intelligence soon shows them the absolute necessity of discipline in an army, and its advantages to all concerned; but the kind of discipline best adapted to them differs materially from that required by other races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>Positions from which the city could be commanded by the enemy's guns were open for their occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>There was so little discipline that officers and men left their camps at their own will, and, as I have already stated, the city was full of drunken men in uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>The executive was demoralized; an attack by the enemy was expected from hour to hour; material of war did not exist in anything like sufficient quantities; and, lastly, I was not supreme and unhampered, but often thwarted by the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">lieutenant-general</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>This was provided for by at once exacting the most rigid discipline and order; by arresting all ignorant officers and men, and sending them back to their regiments; by instituting and enforcing strict rules in regard to permission for leaving the camps; by prohibiting civilians and others not on duty from crossing the river or visiting the camps without permits from headquarters; by organizing permanent brigades under regular officers, and by placing the troops in good defensive positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>I threw them further out from the city, so as to have space in rear for manoeuvring, and selected positions which commanded the various avenues of approach to the city and enabled the different brigades to afford reciprocal support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>I lost no time in acquiring an accurate knowledge of the ground in all directions, and by frequent visits to the troops made them personally acquainted with me, while I learned all about them, their condition and their needs, and thus soon succeeded in inspiring full confidence and a good <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> in place of the lamentable state of affairs which existed on my arrival.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>I have restored order very completely already.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>In re-arranging the posts and organization of the troops I brought over to the <rs>Washington</rs> side of the river those regiments which had been most shaken and demoralized by the defeat of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and retained them there, with the newly arriving regiments, until in fit condition to be trusted on the side towards the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>My report (made in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>) gives in sufficient detail the measures taken to expedite the instruction, discipline, and equipment of the new regiments on the <rs>Washington</rs> side before assigning them to brigades in front of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>I also proceeded at once to reorganize the various staff departments on a footing commensurate with the actual and future condition of affairs, and used every effort to hasten the arrival of new regiments, as well as the manufacture and purchase of war material of all kinds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>Fortunately I had some excellent officers at my disposal and at once made use of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>At this period I committed <num value="1">one</num> of my greatest errors &mdash; that was in retaining <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00070.00346" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName> on duty with the troops under my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>I knew that he had been a close student of military affairs, and thought that he possessed sufficient ability to be useful in a subordinate capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>Moreover, I pitied him extremely, <pb n="71" id="p.71"/>and thought that circumstances had as much to do with his failure at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> as any want of ability and energy on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>I knew that if I sent him away he would be ruined for life, and desired to give him an opportunity to retrieve his military reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>I therefore left him in the nominal command on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side of the river until the order forming the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was issued; he doing some little bureau work and retaining a large staff, while I performed the real military labor demanded by the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>I was sadly deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>He never appreciated my motives, and felt no gratitude for my forbearance and kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Subsequent events proved that, although in some respects a very good bureau officer and a fair disciplinarian and drill-officer for a school of instruction, he lacked the qualities necessary for a commander in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>After <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00071.00347" reg="mostcommon:Pope,John,,,:2"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s campaign it was not safe for <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00071.00348" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> to visit the camps of his troops; the men declared that they would kill him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>I have long been convinced that he intrigued against me to the utmost of his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>His conduct towards <persName n="Porter,,Fitz-John,,," id="n-0001.0004.00071.00349" reg="default:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><foreName>Fitz-John</foreName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> on the <rs n="Second Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">second Bull Run</rs> campaign, his testimony in the latter's trial, and subsequent rehearing in <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, show what manner of man he was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>In all human probability I should have been spared an infinite amount of trouble had I relieved him upon reaching <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>: and allowed him to sink at once into obscurity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>When I resumed command it was clear that a prompt advance was wholly impracticable; for, as I have already stated, the mass of the troops placed under me were utterly demoralized and destitute of organization, instruction, discipline, artillery, cavalry, transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>I repeat that it was not worthy to be called an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>The request to bring with me, or cause to follow, a few of the victorious regiments from <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName> was denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>As it was, nothing remained but to create an army and material as rapidly as possible from the very foundation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>The result of the <rs n="First Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">first Bull Run</rs> had changed the conditions of the problem and complicated them exceedingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>In <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName> I had raw troops against raw troops; my opponents had all the advantages of knowledge of the ground, strong positions, and a country peculiarly adapted to the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>Yet I did not hesitate to attack, and gained complete success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>I felt that against troops who had never been under fire and were not particularly well commanded the offensive offered great advantages, <pb n="72" id="p.72"/>and also felt entire confidence in my ability to handle my men, many of whom had attained a certain rough kind of discipline at <placeName reg="Camp Dennison, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2078714">Camp Dennison</placeName>. But at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> everything was different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>The enemy not only had all the advantages of position, of entrenchments, of the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> resulting from success, but his discipline and drill were far better than our own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>It would have been madness to renew the attempt until a complete change was made, for all the advantages of a sudden movement had been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>The problem now was to attack victorious and finely drilled troops in entrenchment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>I knew that this could be done only by well-organized and well-drilled troops, well supplied with artillery and other arms of service; the future of the war proved the correctness of this view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>I had, therefore, no choice but to create a real army and its material out of nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>The contest had already assumed such a phase that large masses were necessary to decide it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>To use such masses they must be organized and instructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>Perhaps even then a few <num value="1000">thousand</num> regulars would have decided the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>But we had them not!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Let those who criticise me for the delay in creating an army and its material point out an instance when so much has been done with the same means in so short a time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>Not only was it necessary to organize, discipline, and drill the troops, but the immense labor of constructing the fortifications required to secure the city in the absence of the army was also to be performed by the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>Not only did this consume much time and greatly retard the preparation of the army for the field, but it tied down the troops to the line of the defences, and rendered it impossible to take up a more advanced position until the works were finished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Before my arrival no <num value="1">one</num> had contemplated the complete fortification of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>I at once conceived the idea and carried it into effect; for I saw immediately that the safety of the capital would always be a great clog on the movements of the army, unless its security were amply guaranteed by strong entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>I cannot speak in too high terms of the cheerfulness, zeal, and activity with which these raw troops performed this arduous and disagreeable labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>They gave thus early an earnest of what might be expected from them under more trying circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>The system adopted was that of detached earthworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>The <pb n="73" id="p.73"/>most important points were occupied by large bastioned forts closed at the gorge, with magazines, platforms, etc.; the scarps and counterscarps often reveted with timber, the parapets usually sodded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>The intermediate points were occupied by lunettes, redoubts, batteries, etc., and in a few cases these were united by infantry parapets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>The entire circumference of the city was thus protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>Towards <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> the very important advanced points of <persName n="Upton,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00073.00350" reg="mostcommon:Upton,nomatch:0"><surname>Upton</surname></persName>'s and <placeName reg="Munson's Hills">Munson's Hills</placeName> were held by strong works, with some small batteries near by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>This was the key to the approach in that direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>In weighing the magnitude of the task of organizing the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> it must be borne in mind that the deficiency of instructed officers was almost as great as that of well-instructed non-commissioned officers and soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>It is important to emphasize the condition of affairs at this juncture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>If the enemy advanced in fair condition and reasonable force direct upon <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, there were no means of preventing his occupation of <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Weber, Utah" key="tgn,2137140">Arlington Heights</placeName> and the bombardment of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>If he availed himself of the low water in the <rs>Potomac</rs> and crossed at or above the <placeName reg="Somersworth, Strafford, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063800">Great Falls</placeName>, at the same time making a feint on the direct approaches, he could enter the city unopposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>For when I arrived there were neither entrenchments nor troops in position on the <rs>Maryland</rs> side, and <orgName n="command"><persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00073.00351" reg="mostcommon:Banks,N.,P.,,:3"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, near <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, was so distant, so unorganized, demoralized, and unfit to march or fight, that it could exercise no influence on the result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>Soon after my arrival I called upon <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00073.00352" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, then in command of all the troops on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side, for a report as to the condition of his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> he reported as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>In the absence of any precise information I should say that but few regiments, if any, are in such condition at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>Those who were in the last movement are not yet recovered, and the others are raw.

<p>It is, of course, clear that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> item comprises all the officers and men who are effective for the immediate work of the army, yet-either through ignorance, or to injure me by exaggerating the force at my disposal &mdash; often the <quote>total present,</quote> often the <quote>aggregate present and absent,</quote> was given, by those occupying official positions, as the effective strength of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>I shall refer elsewhere to the inconveniences resulting from the position of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and the nature of the frontier formed by the <rs>Potomac</rs>; in this place it will suffice to say that as the <rs>Potomac</rs> is often fordable, and many of the inhabitants on the <pb n="97" id="p.97"/><placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> side were favorable to the enemy, it was a very necessary and difficult task to guard it properly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>In view of its exposed position and immense political importance it was impossible to allow <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0006.00097.00581" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> to be endangered; so that a garrison was always necessary, and all that could be done was to make the fortifications so strong that a comparatively small garrison would suffice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>After the experience of the <rs n="First Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">first Bull Run</rs> the executive would never consent to leave <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> without a large garrison.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>At this juncture it would have been wise to adopt a definite policy with regard to the regular army &mdash; viz., either virtually break it up, as a temporary measure, and distribute its members among the staff and regiments of the volunteer organization, thus giving the volunteers all possible benefit from the discipline and instruction of the regulars, or to fill the regular regiments to their full capacity and employ them as a reserve at critical junctures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>I could not secure the adoption of either plan, and a middle course was followed which resulted less favorably than either of the plans indicated; but it must be said that, even as things were, the regulars were in every way of immense benefit to the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>As a general rule the officers (and, of course, the non-commissioned officers) of the volunteer regiments were entirely ignorant of their duties, and many were unfitted, from their education, moral character, or mental deficiences, for ever acquiring the requisite efficiency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>These latter were weeded out by courts-martial and boards of examination, while the others were instructed <hi rend="italics">pari passu</hi> as they instructed their men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>The small number of regular officers available rendered it impossible to furnish all the staff officers from among them; so that a regiment was very fortunate if its colonel was a regular officer, and a brigade was lucky to have a regular as its commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>The generals were usually, and colonels always, obliged to appoint their staff officers from civil life, and instruct them as best they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>It speaks wonders for the intelligence and military aptitude of our people that so much was well done in this way on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>Many of these raw civilians, who were men of pride, intelligence, and education, soon became excellent officers; though these very men most keenly regretted their lack of a good military education in early life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>The frequent reviews I held at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> were not at all for <pb n="98" id="p.98"/>the benefit of the public, nor yet for the purpose of examining the individual condition of the men, although I did much of that even on these occasions &mdash; for a general with a quick eye can see things when riding at a gallop which would seem impossible to a civilian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>But they were to accustom the regiments to move together and see each other, to give the troops an idea of their own strength, to infuse <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi> and mutual emulation, and to acquaint myself with the capacity of the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>These reviews also had a good effect in accustoming the troops to see me, although they saw so much of me in their camps and on the picket-lines that this was of minor importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>Those I held did much towards making the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> what it became.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>Some persons, who ought to have known better, have supposed that in organizing the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> I set too high a model before me and consumed unnecessary time in striving to form an army of regulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>This was an unjustifiable error on their part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>I should, of course, have been glad to bring that army to the condition of regulars, but no <num value="1">one</num> knew better than myself that, with the means at my command, that would have been impossible within any reasonable or permissible time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>What I strove for and accomplished was to bring about such a condition of discipline and instruction that the army could be handled on the march and on the field of battle, and that orders could be reasonably well carried out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>No <num value="1">one</num> cognizant of the circumstances and possessed of any knowledge of military affairs can honestly believe that I bestowed unnecessary time and labor upon the organization and instruction of that army whose courage, discipline, and efficiency finally brought the war to a close.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>Not a day of it was wasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>The fortifications then erected, both directly and indirectly, saved the capital more than once in the course of the war, and enabled the army to manoeuvre freely and independently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>The organization and discipline then acquired, and so much improved during the campaign of the <name type="place">Peninsula</name> which converted the men into veterans, enabled the army to pass gloriously through the many sanguinary conflicts and harassing <pb n="99" id="p.99"/>campaigns that proved necessary to terminate the war.

<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>The object of the present war differs from those in which nations are usually engaged, mainly in this: that the purpose of ordinary war is to conquer a peace and make a treaty on advantageous terms; in this contest it has become necessary to crush a population sufficiently numerous, intelligent, and warlike to constitute a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>We have not only to defeat their armed and organized forces in the field, but to display such an overwhelming strength as will convince all our antagonists, especially those of the governing, aristocratic class, of the utter impossibility of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>Our late reverses make this course imperative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>Had we been successful in the recent battle (Mansssas) it is possible that we might have been spared the labor and expense of a great effort; now me have no alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>Their success will enable the political leaders of the rebels to convince the mass of their people that we are inferior to them in force and courage, and to command ail their resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>The contest began with a class, now it is with a people; our military success can alone restore the former issue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>By thoroughly defeating their armies, taking their strong places, and pursuing a rigidly protective policy as to private property and unarmed persons, and a lenient course as to private soldiers, we may well hope for a permanent restoration of a peaceful Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>But in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance the authority of the government must be supported by overwhelming physical force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Our foreign relations and financial credit also imperatively demand that the military action of the government should be prompt and irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/><pb n="102" id="p.102"/></p> 
<p>The rebels have chosen <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> as their battle-field, and it seems proper for us to make the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great struggle there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>But while thus directing our main efforts, it is necessary to diminish the resistance there offered us by movements on other points both by land and water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>Without entering at present into details, I would advise that a strong movement be made on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, and that the rebels be driven out of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>As soon as it becomes perfectly clear that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is cordially united with us, I would advise a movement through that State into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> for the purpose of assisting the <rs>Union</rs> men of that region and of seizing the railroads leading from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> to the <rs>East</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>The possession of those roads by us, in connection with the movement on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, would go far towards determining the evacuation of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> by the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>In the meantime all the passes into <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> from the <rs>East</rs> should be securely guarded, but I would advise no movement from that quarter towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, unless the political condition of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> renders it impossible or inexpedient for us to make the movement upon <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> through that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Every effort should, however, be made to organize, equip, and arm as many troops as possible in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, in order to render the <rs>Ohio</rs> and <rs>Indiana</rs> regiments available for other operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>At as early a day as practicable it would be well to protect and reopen the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>. <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> should be occupied by garrisons sufficient to retain them in our possession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>The importance of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> and the line of the <rs>Potomac</rs> in the direction of <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName> will be very materially diminished so soon as our force in this vicinity becomes organized, strong, and efficient, because no capable general will cross the river north of this city when we have a strong army here ready to cut off his retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>To revert to the <rs>West</rs>, it is probable that no very large additions to the troops now in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> will be necessary to secure that State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>I presume that the force required for the movement down the <rs>Mississippi</rs> will be determined by its commander and the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>If <placeName reg="Kentucky, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> assumes the right position not more than <num value="20000">20,000</num> will be needed, together with those that can be raised in that State and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> to secure the latter region and its railroads, as well as ultimately to occupy <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>When we have reorganized our main army here <num value="10000">10,000</num> men ought to be enough to protect the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> <pb n="103" id="p.103"/>and the <rs>Potomac</rs>; <num value="5000">5,000</num> will garrison <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <num value="3000">3,000</num> <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>, and not more than <num value="20000">20,000</num> will be necessary at the utmost for the defence of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>The force must be supplied with the necessary engineer and pontoon trains, and with transportation for everything save tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>Its general line of operations should be so directed that water-transportation can be availed of from point to point by means of the ocean and the rivers emptying into it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>An essential feature of the plan of operations will be the employment of a strong naval force to protect the movement of a fleet of transports intended to convey a considerable body of troops from point to point of the enemy's sea-coast, thus either creating diversions and rendering it necessary for them to detach largely from their main body in order to protect such of their cities as may be threatened, or else landing and forming establishments on their coast at any favorable places that opportunity might offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>This naval force should also co-operate with the main army in its efforts to seize the important seaboard towns of the rebels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>It cannot be ignored that the construction of railroads has introduced a new and very important element into war, by the great facilities thus given for concentrating at particular positions large masses of troops from remote sections, and by creating new strategic points and lines of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>It is intended to overcome this difficulty by the partial operations suggested, and such other as the particular case may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>We must endeavor to seize places on the railways in the rear of the enemy's points of concentration, and me must threaten their seaboard cities, in order that each State may be forced, by the necessity of its own defence, to diminish its contingent to the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>The proposed movement down the <rs>Mississippi</rs> will produce important results in this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>That advance and the progress of the main army at the <rs>East</rs> will materially assist each other by diminishing the resistance to be encountered by each.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>The tendency of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> movement upon all questions connected with cotton is too well understood by the <rs>President</rs> and cabinet to need any illustration from me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>There is another independent movement that has often been <pb n="104" id="p.104"/>suggested and which has always recommended itself to my judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>I refer to a movement from <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> through the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Indian Territory</placeName> upon <placeName reg="Red River, Brown, Texas" key="tgn,2611953">Red river</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Texas</placeName> for the purpose of protecting, and developing the latent Union and free-State sentiment well known to predominate in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Texas</placeName>, and which, like a similar sentiment in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, will, if protected, ultimately organize that section into a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>How far it will be possible to support this movement by an advance through <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> from <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> is a matter which I have not sufficiently examined to be able to express a decided opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>If at all practicable, it is eminently desirable, as bringing into play the resources and warlike qualities of the <rs>Pacific States</rs>, as well as identifying them with our cause and connecting the bond of union between them and the general government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>If it is not departing too far from my province, I will venture to suggest the policy of an ultimate alliance and cordial understanding with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; their sympathies and interests are with us, their antipathies exclusively against our enemies and their institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>I think it would not be difficult to obtain from the <rs>Mexican</rs> government the right to use, at least during the present contest, the road from Guaymas to <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>; this concession would very materially reduce the obstacles of the column moving from the <rs>Pacific</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>A similar permission to use their territory for the passage of troops between the <rs>Panuco</rs> and the <placeName reg="Rio Grande City, Starr, Texas" key="tgn,2107154">Rio Grande</placeName> would enable us to throw a column of troops by a good road from <placeName key="tgn,1018380" n="1.000 4" reg="tampico,tamaulipas,mexico,north and central america">Tampico</placeName>, or some of the small harbors north of it, upon and across the <placeName reg="Rio Grande City, Starr, Texas" key="tgn,2107154">Rio Grande</placeName>, without risk and scarcely firing a shot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>To what extent, if any, it would be desirable to take into service and employ <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> soldiers is a question entirely political, on which I do not venture to offer an opinion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>The force I have recommended is large; the expense is great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>It is possible that a smaller force might accomplish the object in view, but I understand it to be the purpose of this great nation to re-establish the power of its government and restore peace to its citizens in the shortest possible time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>The question to be decided is simply this: Shall we crush the rebellion at <num value="1">one</num> blow, terminate the war in <num value="1">one</num> campaign, or shall we leave it as a legacy for our descendants?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>When the extent of the possible line of operations is considered, the force asked for for the main army under my command cannot be regarded as unduly large; every mile we advance carries us further from our base of operations and renders detachments necessary to cover our communications, while the enemy will be constantly concentrating as he falls back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>I propose, with the force which I have requested, not only to drive the enemy out of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and occupy <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, but to occupy <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n-0001.0006.00104.00587" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, <pb n="105" id="p.105"/><placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and New Orleans; in other words to move into the heart of the enemy's country and crush the rebellion in its very heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>By seizing and repairing the railroads as we advance the difficulties of transportation will be materially diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>It is perhaps unnecessary to state that, in addition to the forces named in this memorandum, strong reserves should be formed, ready to supply any losses that may occur.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>In conclusion, I would submit that the exigencies of the treasury may be lessened by making only partial payments to our troops when in the enemy's country, and by giving the obligations of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for such supplies as may there be obtained. </p><closer><signed><persName n="McClellan,Major-General,George,B.,," id="n-0001.0006.00105.00588" reg="expanded:McClellan,George,Brinton,,"><foreName n="George">Geo.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>McClellan</surname>, <roleName n="Major-General">Maj.-Gen.</roleName></persName></signed></closer></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>In the light of the experience of the <measure n="22years" type="date">twenty-two years</measure> which have elapsed since this Memorandum was so hastily prepared, and after full consideration of all the events of the long and bloody war which followed it, I still hold to the soundness of the views it expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>Had the measures recommended been carried into effect the war would have been closed in less than <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the time and with infinite saving of blood and treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>So far as I know, it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> general plan of operations proposed upon a scale adequate to the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>It is well understood that, although the ultimate design of the enemy is to possess himself of the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> efforts will be directed towards <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, with the intention of cutting our line of communication and supplies, as well as to arouse an insurrection in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>. To accomplish this he will no doubt show a certain portion of his force in front of our positions on the other side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, in order to engage our attention there and induce us to leave a large portion of our force for the defence of those positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>He will probably also make demonstrations in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Aquia Creek, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1132269">Acquia Creek</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mathias Point, King George, Virginia" key="tgn,2496456">Mathias Point</placeName>, and the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, in order still further to induce us to disseminate our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>His main and real movement will doubtless be to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> between <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=31" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Point of Rocks</placeName>, probably not far from <placeName key="tgn,2652408" n="1.000 1" reg="seneca mills, yates, new york">Seneca Mills</placeName>, and most likely at more points than <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>His hope will be so to engage our attention by the diversions already named as to enable him to move with a large force direct and unopposed on <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>I see no reason to doubt the possibility of his attempting this with a column of at least <num value="100000">100,000</num> effective troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>If he has only <num value="130000">130,000</num> under arms, he can make all the diversions I have mentioned with his raw and badly organized troops, leaving <num value="100000">100,000</num> effective men for his real movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>As I am now situated I can by no possibility bring to bear against this column more than <num value="70000">70,000</num>, and probably not over <num value="60000">60,000</num>, effective troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>In regard to the composition of our active army, it must be borne in mind that the very important arms of cavalry and artillery had been almost entirely neglected until I assumed command of this army, and that consequently the troops of these arms, although greatly increased in numbers, are comparatively raw and inexperienced, most of the cavalry not being yet armed or equipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>In making the foregoing estimate of numbers I have reduced the enemy's force below what is regarded by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and other official circles as its real strength, and have taken the reverse course as to our own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Our situation, <pb n="107" id="p.107"/>then, is simply this: if the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the enemy follows the simplest dictates of the military art we must meet him with greatly inferior forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>To render success possible the divisions of our army must be more ably led and commanded than those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>The fate of the nation and the success of the cause in which we are engaged must be mainly decided by the issue of the next battle to be fought by the army now under my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>I therefore feel that the interests of the nation demand that the ablest soldiers in the service should be on duty with the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, and that, contenting ourselves with remaining on the defensive for the present at all other points, this army should at once be reinforced by all the effective troops that the <name>East</name> and <name>West</name> and <name>North</name> can furnish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>In view of these facts I respectfully urge that all the available troops in <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>, and at least <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> troops (there being <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> there unarmed), and all those of the <rs>Eastern</rs> and Northern States, be at once directed to report to me for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>I beg leave to repeat the opinion I have heretofore expressed: that the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> should number not less than <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> men in order to insure complete success and an early termination of the war.

<argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>Organization of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> &mdash; what an Army is &mdash; infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineer troops &mdash; the staff and its departments &mdash; details of the creation of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.</p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>The organized armies of modern times consist of <num value="2">two</num> well-defined parts: the fighting force, or <quote>line,</quote> and <quote>the staff,</quote> which directs, inspects, and supplies the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>The line is made up of infantry, artillery, cavalry, and engineer troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>As infantry can move wherever a man can set his foot, can fight on all kinds of ground, gives the most destructive fire of all the arms, and is the least expensive and most easily instructed, it constitutes the great bulk of all large armies, and is decidedly the most important.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>With equally good generals, that army which has the best infantry is pretty sure to win, for no reasonable superiority in the other arms of service can compensate for marked inferiority in the infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>The essential qualities of good infantry are: the ability to make long marches, with their full equipment, without straggling; accuracy of fire; confidence in their ability to use the bayonet &mdash; for this will prevent their breaking upon the very near approach of a hostile line &mdash; coolness, intelligence, determination, and mutual confidence in attacking or receiving an attack; the ability to reform rapidly after a successful attack, and to rally when driven back, either after a repulsed attack or when obliged to retreat from a defensive position; the power of enduring fatigue, exposure, and hunger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>Next in importance is the artillery, whose work it is to open the way for, and cover the movements of, the other arms by destroying the enemy's defences at long range, silencing his artillery, and demoralizing his infantry; or, at short ranges, to crush them by a rapid fire of case and shrapnel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>It is also a part of its duty to cover the retreat of beaten infantry, and to assist in the operations of detached bodies of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/><pb n="109" id="p.109"/></p> 
<p>There is thus <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>, whose business it is to handle siege-guns and those used in permanent defences, and <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field-artillery</orgName>, who accompany an army in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/><orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">Field-artillery</orgName> is made up of <num value="3">three</num> kinds &mdash; viz., the mounted batteries, whose cannoneers usually march on foot, but during rapid movements ride upon the carriages and caissons, and which serve with the regiment, division, and <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>; the <orgName n="Horse Battery" type="battery">horse-batteries</orgName>, whose cannoneers are provided with saddle-horses, and which are especially intended for service with the cavalry; and the batteries of position, consisting of the heaviest field-guns, intended especially for action against the enemy's material defences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>The field-guns, at the period of which I write, were generally provided in the ratio of at least <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> guns to each <num value="1000">thousand</num> infantry, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> guns to each <num value="1000">thousand</num> cavalry, the exact proportion depending somewhat on the nature of the field of war and the quality of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>With raw troops a somewhat larger proportion is necessary than with veterans.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>The technical information necessary for the artillery officers and men renders it difficult to improvise thoroughly efficient artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>The cavalry is an indispensable part of every army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>It not only takes part, as occasion demands, in general battles, but, with a due proportion of <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse-artillery</orgName>, is capable of independent action, even at long distances from the main body of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>Upon it devolves to a great extent the duty of observing and discovering the positions, movements, and strength of the enemy, as well as masking those of its own army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>It is capable of making extensive inroads into the enemy's country, and is usually employed to threaten and attack his communications, supply-trains, etc.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>The modern improvements in firearms have certainly affected the employment of cavalry on the field of battle against infantry and artillery, but have not lessened the importance of its other duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>Nor is it probable that the number of these arms will in the future be materially diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>The employment of breech-loading small arms has added very much to the strength of cavalry, and it is certain that in future wars large bodies of cavalry will be employed as mounted infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>That is, they will use their horses to move rapidly to the point of action, and fight on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>Under ordinary circumstances it has usually been regarded <pb n="110" id="p.110"/>as advisable to furnish cavalry to the extent of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> of the infantry force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>To render cavalry efficient it is necessary that the officers and men should be of a superior order of intelligence, and that they should fully understand the care of their horses, which should be active and enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>Officers and men should be excellent horsemen, skilful in the use of their weapons, and thoroughly instructed in the work of reconnoissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>It is really much more difficult to form reliable cavalry at short notice than to instruct artillery and infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>It is the duty of engineer troops to conduct siege operations; to supervise and construct temporary defences and the works for their attack; to construct, repair, and destroy bridges of all kinds, fords, roads, etc.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>The repair and destruction of railways should also be under their direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>The performance of these duties requires a superior order of men, skilled in some mechanical trade, and needs careful instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>In ordinary cases the engineer troops should number about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="40" type="ordinal">fortieth</num> of the infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>To direct the movements and supply the wants of the combatants is the business of the staff which in modern armies is a complicated and extensive organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>As so much depends upon the faithful and intelligent discharge of these very important duties, it is absolutely necessary that the officers of this corps should be thoroughly instructed soldiers of long experience, the highest integrity, the greatest intelligence, with great industry and method in the performance of these duties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>I replied that I wished the force under my command to be organized as and denominated an army instead of a geographical division; that I should <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> form brigades, then divisions, and, when in the field, <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>. My reason for postponing the formation of the latter was that with untried general officers it would be too dangerous an experiment to appoint any to such high and important commands without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proving them in actual campaign and in battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>He objected to all I proposed, save the brigade formation, saying that under our system and regulations it would be impossible to administer the affairs of an <quote>army,</quote> and that the retention of the system and nomenclature of geographical divisions and departments was an absolute necessity; he also objected to the formation of divisions as unnecessary, for the reason that in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> he had only brigades.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>I called to his attention the fact that, all the world over, fighting forces were organized as armies; that I had done so in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>; and that his force in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> was a very small affair in comparison with that soon to be collected in front of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> days of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> I procured the passage of an act authorizing the appointment of additional aides-de-camp to general officers; these might be taken from civil life or from the army, and were to be of no higher grade than that of colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>I used this lam not only to furnish the requisite number of actual aides-de-camp, but also to give additional pay and rank in the regular army to officers whose duty made such a step necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>Circumstances beyond my control rendered it impossible for me to carry out my views as to the cavalry, and it was entirely against my wishes and judgment that I was left in the field with so small a force of this arm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>These regiments rendered good service as engineer troops, and at length became admirable pontoniers, as their services under fire more than once testified.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/><num value="1">One</num> of the greatest defects in our military system is the lack of a thoroughly instructed staff corps, from which should be furnished chief of staff of armies, <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> and divisions, adjutant-general, and aides-de-camp and recruiting officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>Perhaps the greatest difficulty that I encountered in the work of creating the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> arose from the scarcity of thoroughly instructed staff officers, and I must frankly state that every day I myself felt the disadvantages under which I personally labored from the want of that thorough theoretical and practical education received by the officers of the <name>German</name> <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>Under our system of government, and in the circumstances which surround us, it is perhaps impossible, certainly very improbable, that this most vital point can ever be satisfactorily covered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>Political and personal considerations now control so completely the appointment to places in the various branches of the staff that the chances are against their being filled by the most competent men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>In fact, judging from the experience of the past few years, it is almost a certainty that incompetent men will be selected for these most important positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>Inefficiency and waste must surely result from our present system, even in times of peace; but in the event of our being thrown into collision with a well-organized <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> army, the results will be disastrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>Should we ever have a <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> who understands his business and possesses the full support of the administration and of Congress, the work may be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>But even if commenced in the right way, the danger would be that in the course of time presidents would appoint to the corps political or personal favorites, unless the law so hedged in the corps that appointments could only be made upon the recommendation of the chief of the corps and a board of its officers after a proper test of their qualifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>I am very sure that every general officer who served in the late war will agree with me that his <pb n="121" id="p.121"/>labors would have been immensely lightened and the efficiency of his command very much increased if he could have had a competent staff at his disposal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>In comparison with the difficulties of the work that fell to my lot the task of a general officer of the <name>German</name> army seems mere child's play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>None of the officers at my disposal had ever seen large armies or the operations of war on a grand scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>Those who came from <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> had a good education, so far as the theory of war was concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>That was a great advantage, but by no means all that was required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>Those whom I selected were usually comparatively young men, and, under my direction, soon grasped the situation; but <num value="1">one</num> very great obstacle arose from the incompetence of many of the permanent heads of departments, who found it very difficult to get out of the ruts in which they had been accustomed to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>To pass suddenly from the small scale on which the affairs of an army of <num value="10000">10,000</num> men in time of peace had been conducted, to that required for an army of half a <num value="1000000">million</num> in the midst of a desperate war, was no easy task.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>I have dwelt somewhat at length on this subject in order to accentuate the difficulties of the position, and to show that the time consumed in organizing the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was far from unreasonable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>During the war many improvements were made in the details of the administration of the staff corps; but unfortunately no change whatever has been made in the organization of the various departments, and their only gain by the war is in the personal experience of the officers who served therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>When they have passed away there will be little or no trace left of the experience of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>Our own experience, and that of other armies, agree in determining the necessity for an efficient and able staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>To obtain this our staff establishment should be based on correct principles, and extended to be adequate to the necessities of the service, and should include a system of staff and line education.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>Moreover, the officers of the staff should be required occasionally to serve with troops as officers of the line, and when the turn of each comes for promotion it should be determined not only whether he is fit for promotion, but whether he is fit to remain in the corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>They then saw clearly that it would not be possible to make a party tool of me, and soon concluded that it was their policy to ruin me if possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>It had been clearly stated by Congress and the general government that the sole object of the war was the <quote>preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> and the prevention of the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>We fought to keep them in the <rs>Union</rs>, and the practically unanimous sentiment of the army, as well as of the mass of the people, was at that time strongly in favor of confining the war to that object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>Although the <rs>Free-Soil</rs> element was strong in the <rs>North</rs>, the <name>Abolitionists</name> proper were weak, and a declaration of their true purposes would have seriously interfered with the progress of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>A clear indication of the correctness of this statement lies in the fact that the executive never disowned my proclamation to the <rs>West</rs> <rs n="Virginian people" type="group">Virginians</rs> nor the policy I pursued in reference to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>They committed a grave error in supposing me to be politically ambitious and in thinking that I looked forward to military success as a means of reaching the presidential chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>At the same time they knew that if I achieved marked success my influence would necessarily be very great throughout the country &mdash; an influence which I should certainly have used for the good of the whole country, and not for that of any party at the nation's expense.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>They therefore determined to ruin me in any event and by any means: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by endeavoring to force me into premature movements, knowing that a failure would probably end my military career; afterwards by withholding the means necessary to achieve success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>That they were not honest is proved by the fact that, having failed to force me to advance at a time when an advance would have been madness, they withheld the means of success when I was in contact with the enemy, and finally relieved me from command when the game was in my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>They determined that I should not succeed, and carried out their determinations only too well and at a fearful sacrifice of blood, time, and treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/><pb n="151" id="p.151"/>To end the war before the nation was ready for that would be a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>The war must be prolonged, and conducted so as to achieve that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>That the people of the <rs>North</rs> were not yet ready to accept that view, and that it would not answer to permit me to succeed until the people had been worked up to the proper pitch on that question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>There was no friend of yours present to contradict these statements, of course.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>As a further proof that the administration did not intend the <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular campaign</rs> to be successful may be cited the fact that on the <dateStruct value="1862-04-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after left <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to assume command in the field, there was issued <rs n="General Order 33" type="misc">General Order No. 33</rs>, closing all the recruiting depots for the volunteers and stopping all recruiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>It is hardly credible that the members of the administration were ignorant of the fact that an army in the field must meet with some losses under the most favorable circumstances, and that to stop all supplies of men at such a juncture is the most unpardonable of follies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>I had no reason to suspect his sincerity, and therefore believed him to be what he professed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>The most disagreeable thing about him was the extreme virulence with which he abused the <rs>President</rs>, the administration, and the <rs>Republican</rs> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>He carried this to such an extent that I was often shocked by it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>He never gave them credit for honesty or patriotism, and very seldom for any ability.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>He often advocated the propriety of my seizing the government and taking affairs into my own hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>As he always expressed himself in favor of putting down the rebellion at any cost, I always regarded these extreme views as the ebullitions of an intense and patriotic nature, and sometimes wasted more or less time in endeavoring to bring him to more moderate views, never dreaming that all the while this man was in close communication with the very men whom he so violently abused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>The fact is that, so far as purely military matters were concerned, <persName n="Cameron,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00152.00908" reg="nearbymention:Cameron,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName> had not at all interfered with me, but gave me full support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>Finally, <num value="1">one</num> day when I returned to my house from my day's work and was dressing for dinner, a lady of my family told me that <persName n="Key,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00153.00910" reg="mostcommon:Key,Thomas,M.,,:3"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Key</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of my aides, had just been there to inform me that <persName n="Cameron,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00153.00911" reg="nearbymention:Cameron,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName> had resigned and that <persName n="Stanton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00153.00912" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> was appointed in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation that I had of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2165"/>Before I had finished my toilet <persName n="Stanton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00153.00913" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s card came up, and as soon as possible I went down to see him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2166"/>He told me that he had been appointed <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and that his name had been sent to the <name>Senate</name> for confirmation, and that he had called to confer with me as to his acceptance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2167"/>He said that acceptance would involve very great personal sacrifices on his part, and that the only possible inducement would be that he might have it in his power to aid me in the work of putting down the rebellion; that he was willing to devote all his time, intellect, and energy to my assistance, and that together we could soon bring the war to an end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2168"/>If I wished him to accept he would do so, but only on my account; that he had come to know my wishes and determine accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2169"/>I told him that I hoped he would accept the position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2170"/>Soon after <persName n="Stanton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00153.00914" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> became <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> it became clear that, without any reason known to me, our relations had completely changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2171"/>Instead of using his new position to assist me he threw every obstacle in my way, and did all in his power to create difficulty and distrust between the <rs>President</rs> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2172"/>I soon found it impossible to gain access to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2173"/>Before he was in office he constantly ran after me and professed the most <pb n="154" id="p.154"/>ardent friendship; as soon as he became <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> his whole manner changed, and I could no longer find the opportunity to transact even the ordinary current business of the office with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2174"/>It is now very clear to me that, far from being, as he had always represented himself to me, in direct and violent opposition to the radicals, he was really in secret alliance with them, and that he and they were alike unwilling that I should be successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2175"/>No other theory can possibly account for his and their course, and on that theory everything becomes clear and easily explained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2176"/>Had I been successful in my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaign the rebellion would perhaps have been terminated without the immediate abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2177"/>To gain their ends with the <rs>President</rs> they played upon his apprehensions for the safety of Washington-growing out of his complete ignorance of war &mdash; as well as upon his personal aspirations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2178"/>I believe that the leaders of the radical branch of the <rs>Republican</rs> party preferred political control in <num value="1">one</num> section of a divided country to being in the minority in a restored Union.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2179"/>Not only did these people desire the abolition of slavery, but its abolition in such a manner and under such circumstances that the slaves would at once be endowed with the electoral franchise, while the intelligent white man of the <rs>South</rs> should be deprived of it, and permanent control thus be secured through the votes of the ignorant slaves, composing so large a portion of the population of the seceded States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2180"/>Influenced by these motives, they succeeded but too well in sowing the seeds of distrust in <persName n="Lincoln,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00154.00915" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:25"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s mind, so that, even before I actually commenced the <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular campaign</rs>, I had lost that cordial support of the executive which was necessary to attain success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2181"/>It may be said that under these circumstances it was my duty to resign my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2182"/>But I had become warmly attached to the soldiers, who already had learned to love me well; all my pride was wrapped up in the army that I had created, and I knew of no commander at all likely to be assigned to it in my place who would be competent to conduct its operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2183"/>Nor did I at that time fully realize the length to which these men were prepared to go in carrying out their schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2184"/>For instance, I did not suspect, until the orders reached me, that <pb n="155" id="p.155"/><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> and the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName> would be withdrawn from my control; and when those orders arrived they found me too far committed to permit me to withdraw with honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2185"/>With the troops under fire it did not become me to offer my resignation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2186"/>The difficulties of my position in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> commenced when I was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> confined to my bed with typhoid fever in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> (<dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>) for some <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, and culminated soon after <persName n="Stanton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00155.00916" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> became <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2187"/>Up to this time there had been no serious difficulty; there were slight murmurs of impatience at the delay in moving, but all sensible and well-informed men saw the impossibility of entering upon a campaign at that season, and no party was as yet openly formed against me.</p> 
<p>My malady was supposed to be more serious than it really was; for, although very weak and ill, my strong constitution enabled me to retain a clear intellect during the most trying part of the illness, so that I daily transacted business and gave the necessary orders, never for a moment abandoning the direction of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2188"/>As is often the case with such diseases, I sometimes passed days and nights without sleeping, and it more than once happened that the <rs>President</rs> called while I was asleep after such intervals of wakefulness, and, being denied admittance, his anxiety induced him to think that my disease was very acute and would terminate fatally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2189"/>The radical leaders skilfully availed themselves of the state of affairs to drive in an entering wedge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2190"/>They represented to the <rs>President</rs> that as I kept my own counsels and was not in the habit of consulting or advising with others, but acted entirely on my own judgment, no <num value="1">one</num> but myself knew the exact condition of the army, its state of preparation, or the designs I had in view; that, should my malady terminate suddenly and fatally, great confusion would ensue, and that it was necessary to provide against such an emergency by causing a secret examination to be made immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2191"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inkling of this came through <persName n="Stanton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00155.00917" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, not yet <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, who said to me: <quote>They are counting on your death, and are already dividing among themselves your military goods and chattels.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/>The fact was that, although I was in the habit of acting solely on my own judgment, and never told more of my intentions than <pb n="156" id="p.156"/>was absolutely necessary, I always consulted freely with the chiefs of the staff departments, each of whom knew the exact condition of affairs in his own department and could give to any properly authorized person all necessary explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2193"/>So that a secret examination was not only unnecessary, but could not produce as good results as the honest, direct way of coming to me and directing me to instruct my staff to explain the state of affairs to the <rs>President</rs> or <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>. <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00918" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Franklin,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00919" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,William,B.,,:10"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and, I think, <persName n="Meigs,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00920" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><surname>Meigs</surname></persName> were entrusted by the <rs>President</rs> with this business.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>This information reached me when the crisis of my malady was over, and learning &mdash; also through <persName n="Stanton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00923" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>--that a grand conclave was to assemble without my knowledge, I mustered strength enough on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> (<dateStruct value="1862-01-12"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg="12">12</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>) to be driven to the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, where my unexpected appearance caused very much the effect of a shell in a powder-magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>It was very clear from the manner of those I met there that there was something of which they were ashamed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>I made no allusion to what I knew, nor was anything said to me on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>But I took advantage of the occasion to explain to the <rs>President</rs> in a general and casual way what my intentions were; and before I left he told me that there was to be a meeting at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> next day, and invited me to attend, but made no reference to the object of the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>At the designated hour I went to the <placeName reg="President's office">President's office</placeName> and there met a party consisting of the <rs>President</rs>, <persName n="Seward,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00924" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretaries</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <persName n="Chase,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00925" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Secretary"></roleName><surname>Chase</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Blair,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00926" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Secretary"></roleName><surname>Blair</surname></persName>, <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00927" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Franklin,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00928" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,William,B.,,:10"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Meigs,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00929" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Meigs</surname></persName>. I do not think that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> (<persName n="Cameron,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00930" reg="nearbymention:Cameron,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName>) was present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>I sat by <persName n="Blair,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00931" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName> and <persName n="Meigs,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00932" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Meigs</surname></persName>, and entered into conversation with them upon topics of general interest having no possible bearing upon any subject that could be brought before the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2202"/>Meanwhile there was a good deal of whispering among the others, in which I do not think <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00933" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,William,B.,,:10"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> took any special part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>Finally <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00156.00934" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> said he wished to explain to me the part he had in the examination, which had commenced, into the state of the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>Exactly what he said has escaped my memory, except that he <pb n="157" id="p.157"/>disclaimed any purpose hostile to me, and based what had been done on the ground of the supposed critical nature of my illness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>I stopped the explanation by saying that as I was now again restored to health the case had changed, and that, as the examination must now cease, further explanations were unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/><persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00935" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,William,B.,,:10"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> then said a few words clearing himself of any improper motives, which was needless, as I could not suspect him of anything wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>I then quietly resumed my conversation with <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00936" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> and <persName n="Meigs,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00937" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><surname>Meigs</surname></persName>, awaiting further developments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>The whispering then recommenced, especially between the <rs>President</rs> and <persName n="Chase,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00938" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>; when at length the latter (<persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00939" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>) spoke aloud, for the benefit of all assembled, in a very excited tone and manner, saying that he understood the purpose of the meeting to be that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00940" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> should then and there explain his military plans in detail, that they might be submitted to the approval or disapproval of the gentlemen present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>The uncalled &mdash; for violence of his manner surprised me, but I determined to avail myself of it by keeping perfectly cool myself, and contented myself with remarking-what was entirely true &mdash; that the purpose he expressed was entirely new to me; that I did not recognize the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> as in any manner my official superior, and that I denied his right to question me upon the military affairs committed to my charge; that in the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> alone did I recognize the right to interrogate me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>I then quietly resumed my conversation with <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00941" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> and <persName n="Meigs,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00942" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><surname>Meigs</surname></persName>, taking no further notice of <persName n="Chase,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00943" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>I must again state that this meeting had been arranged when I was supposed to be too ill to attend, and that the original and real purpose was not as <persName n="Chase,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00944" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> stated it, but <quote>to dispose of the military goods and chattels</quote> of the sick man so inopportunely restored to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>In another connection I have already stated that some weeks before the date of this meeting I had given <persName n="Chase,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00946" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> a sketch of the proposed <placeName reg="Urbanna, Middlesex, Virginia" key="tgn,2114705">Urbana</placeName> movement, and that he was much pleased with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>Here I need only say in addition that I did this entirely of my own volition, for the purpose indicated, and that <persName n="Swinton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00157.00947" reg="mostcommon:Swinton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Swinton</surname></persName> is entirely mistaken in stating that it was by direction of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>At this previous interview <persName n="Chase,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00158.00949" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> seemed very grateful for the confidence I reposed in him and for my thoughtfulness in thus seeking to relieve his mind in his troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>I presume the after-thought, and the object of the intrigues, cut short by my recovery, was to take advantage of this plan by having it carried into effect by <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00158.00950" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>In no other way can I account for the uncalled &mdash; for irritation displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>This impression is strengthened by other circumstances which will appear as I proceed with my story.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>To return to the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>After I had thus disposed of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> he resumed his whispering with the <rs>President</rs>, who, after the lapse of some minutes, said: <quote>Well, <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00158.00951" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, I think you had better tell us what your plans are</quote> --or words to that effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>To this I replied, in substance, that if the <rs>President</rs> had confidence in me it was not right or necessary to entrust my designs to the judgment of others, but that if his confidence was so slight as to require my opinions to be fortified by those of other persons it would be wiser to replace me by some <num value="1">one</num> fully possessing his confidence; that no general commanding an army would willingly submit his plans to the judgment of such an assembly, in which some were incompetent to form a valuable opinion, and others incapable of keeping a secret, so that anything made known to them would soon spread over <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and become known to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>I also reminded the <rs>President</rs> that he and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> knew in general terms what my designs were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>Finally, I declined giving any further information to the meeting, unless the <rs>President</rs> gave me the order in writing and assumed the responsibility of the results.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>This was probably an unexpected <hi rend="italics">d&eacute;nouement</hi>. <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> was not willing to assume the responsibility; and, after a little more whispering between him and <persName n="Chase,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00158.00952" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, <persName n="Seward,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00158.00953" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> arose, buttoned his coat, and laughingly said, <quote>Well, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, I think the meeting had better break up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>I don't see that we are likely to make much out of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0009.00158.00954" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>With that the meeting adjourned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>I waited until that had ceased, then walked up to the <rs>President</rs>, begged him not to allow himself to be acted upon by <pb n="159" id="p.159"/>improper influences, but still to trust me, and said that if he would leave military affairs to me I would be responsible that I would bring matters to a successful issue and free him from all his troubles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>The radicals never again lost their influence with the <rs>President</rs>, and henceforth directed all their efforts to prevent my achieving success.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>When I arrived at the place I found the bateau bridge nearly completed; the holding-ground proved better than had been anticipated; the weather was favorable, there being no wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>I at once crossed over the <num value="2">two</num> brigades which had arrived, and took steps to hurry up the other <num value="2">two</num>, belonging respectively to <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0011.00192.01277" reg="nearbymention:Banks,N.,P.,,"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n-0001.0011.00192.01278" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,J.,,,:1"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>The difficulty of crossing supplies had not then become apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>Next morning the attempt was made to pass the canal-boats <pb n="193" id="p.193"/>through the lift-lock, in order to commence at once the construction of a permanent bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>It was then found for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that the lock was too small to permit the passage of the boats, it having been built for a class of boats running on the <placeName reg="Shenandoah canal">Shenandoah canal</placeName>, and too narrow by some <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> for the canal-boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>The lift-locks, above and below, are all large enough for the ordinary boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>I had seen them at <placeName reg="Edward's Ferry">Edward's Ferry</placeName> thus used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>It had always been represented to the engineers by the military railroad employees and others that the lock <hi rend="italics">was</hi> large enough, and, the difference being too small to be detected by the eye, no <num value="1">one</num> had thought of measuring it or suspected any difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>I thus suddenly found myself unable to build the permanent bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>A violent gale had arisen, which threatened the safety of our only means of communication; the narrow approach to the bridge was so crowded and clogged with wagons that it was very clear that, under existing circumstances, nothing more could be done than to cross over the baggage and supplies of the <num value="2">two</num> brigades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>Of these, instead of being able to cross both during the morning, the last arrived only in time to go over just before dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>It was evident that the troops under orders would only be in the way, should they arrive, and that it would not be possible to subsist them for a rapid march on <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>It was therefore deemed necessary to countermand the order, content ourselves with covering the reopening of the railroad for the present, and in the meantime use every exertion to establish, as promptly as possible, depots of forage and subsistence on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side to supply the troops and enable them to move on <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> independently of the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>The next day (<dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>) I sent a strong reconnoissance to <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>, and, under its protection, went there myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>I then determined to hold that place, and to move the troops composing <persName n="Lander,,,,," id="n-0001.0011.00193.01280" reg="nearbymention:Lander,F.,W.,,"><surname>Lander</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Williams,,,,," id="n-0001.0011.00193.01281" reg="mostcommon:Williams,Seth,,,:10"><surname>Williams</surname></persName>'s commands at once on <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>, thus effectually covering the reconstruction of the railroad.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>It was a part of <persName n="Stanton,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0011.00195.01290" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s policy &mdash; only too well carried out &mdash; to prevent frequent personal interviews between the <rs>President</rs> and myself; he was thus enabled to say <num value="1">one</num> thing to the <rs>President</rs> and exactly the opposite to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>A few days later, on the <dateStruct value="-03-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, the <rs>President</rs> sent for me at an early hour in the morning, about <time value="7:30">half-past 7</time>, and I found him in his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>He appeared much concerned about something, and soon said that he wished to talk with me about <quote>a very ugly matter.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>I asked what it was; and, as he still hesitated, I said that the sooner and more directly such things were approached the better.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>He then referred to the <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> affair (the boats being too wide for the lift-locks, etc.), upon which I found that the secretary had deceived me when he said that the <rs>President</rs> was satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>I told him what had passed between the secretary and myself (as related above), at which he was much surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>He told me that he had never heard of my memorandum or of any explanation on my part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>I then gave him my statement of the matter, with which he expressed himself entirely satisfied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>He then adverted to the more serious &mdash; or ugly &mdash; matter, and now the effects of the intrigues by which he had been surrounded became apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>He said that it had been represented <pb n="196" id="p.196"/>to him (and he certainly conveyed to me the distinct impression that he regarded these representations as well founded) that my plan of campaign (which was to leave <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> under the protection of a sufficient garrison, its numerous well-built and well-armed fortifications, and the command of <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0011.00196.01291" reg="nearbymention:Banks,N.,P.,,"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, then in the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName>, and to throw the whole active army suddenly by water from <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> to the forts on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and thence by the shortest route upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>) was conceived with the traitorous intent of removing its defenders from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and thus giving over to the enemy the capital and the government, thus left defence-less.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>It is difficult to understand that a man of <persName n="Lincoln,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0011.00196.01292" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s intelligence could give ear to such abominable nonsense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>I was seated when he said this, concluding with the remark that it did look to him much like treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>Upon this I arose, and, in a manner perhaps not altogether decorous towards the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">chief magistrate</rs>, desired that he should retract the expression, telling him that I could permit no <num value="1">one</num> to couple the word treason with my name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>He was much agitated, and at once disclaimed any idea of considering me a traitor, and said that he merely repeated what others had said, and that he did not believe a word of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>I suggested caution in the use of language, and again said that I would permit no doubt to be thrown upon my intentions; whereupon he again apologized and disclaimed any purpose of impugning my motives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>I then informed him that I had called a meeting of the generals of division for that day with reference to the proposed attack upon the enemy's Potomac batteries, and suggested that my plan should be laid before them in order that he might be satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>This was done, and I heard no more of treason in that connection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>Before leaving this subject I will call attention to the fact that my official report contained the statement that the secretary had assured me of the <rs>President</rs>'s approval of my action when I returned from the upper Potomac, and that this assertion was never denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>Moreover, no other statement made in the memorandum was ever denied or objected to either by the <rs>President</rs> or the secretary; and that memorandum shows very clearly that there was no ground of dissatisfaction with my conduct, but that <pb n="197" id="p.197"/>I did precisely what I told them I should do under given circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>In my official report I have given all necessary information as to the reasons which prevented an attack upon the enemy's batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>I will here repeat only that careful reconnoissances and a full consideration of the matter led to the inevitable conclusion that although we might, at a greater or less sacrifice of life, carry and destroy any particular battery, we could prevent the construction of permanent batteries and the employment of rifled field-batteries only by a general movement of the army to drive the enemy entirely behind the Rappahan-neck and <placeName reg="Rapidan, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129009">Rapidan</placeName>, after a general action; and that it would then be necessary to hold the lines of those rivers in force or continue the campaign by the overland route.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>I did not regard the inconvenience resulting from the presence of the enemy's batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs> as sufficiently great to justify the direct efforts necessary to dislodge them, especially since it was absolutely certain that they would evacuate all their positions as soon as they became aware of the movement to the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York rivers</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>It was therefore with the greatest reluctance that I made the arrangements required to carry out the positive orders of the government, and it was with great satisfaction that I found myself relieved from the necessity of making what I knew to be a false and unnecessary movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>When the enemy abandoned his position on the <dateStruct value="-03-08"><day reg="8">8th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-03-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, the roads were still in such a condition as to make the proposed movement upon the batteries impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>Before this time I had strongly and repeatedly urged upon the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> the propriety of hastening the completion of the <hi>Monitor</hi>, that she might be sent to the <rs>Potomac</rs> to try her hand upon the batteries on its banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>As the reason for this I urged that it was well to try her qualities under fire, when necessary repairs and alterations could readily be made, rather than to send her immediately to New Orleans, as had been intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/>It is a little singular that the effect of my urgency was to hasten her completion, so that she arrived in <placeName reg="Hampton Roads, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2374406">Hampton Roads</placeName> in season to check the operations of the <hi><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n-0001.0011.00197.01293" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi>. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>Everything was to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>An army was to be created <hi rend="italics">ab initio</hi>--out of nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>Raw material there was, but it was completely raw, and was to be fashioned into shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/><rs type="role2">Private</rs> soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers, regiments, brigades, divisions, <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, armies, with all their staff corps, were to be organized and instructed, not merely on paper, but in effective reality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>Small arms, field-guns, siege and <orgName n="Garrison Artillery" type="artillery">garrison artillery</orgName>, ammunition, equipments, camp-equipage, bridges, ambulances, baggage and supply trains, tents, clothing &mdash; all these wonderful instruments, and <hi rend="italics">impedimenta</hi> of a modern army were to be fabricated; and not only fabricated, but so made that it would be possible to use them: so strong as to withstand a heavy strain, so light that they could be handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>It added to the difficulty of the task that no army approaching in magnitude that now required had ever existed on this continent, so that our own experience was not of much avail in the crisis so suddenly upon us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>In fact, <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest obstacles I encountered at this time was the difficulty of drawing some of the heads of departments out of the old ruts, and convincing them that what was eminently appropriate for <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men was often <pb n="199" id="p.199"/>an absurdity or impossibility for <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> times those numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>Besides all this &mdash; and going on <hi rend="italics">pari passu</hi> with it all &mdash; was the irresistible and pressing necessity of so fortifying <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as to provide for its immediate and future safety; so that the active army of operations should not necessarily be tied down to it as its base of operations and be unable to uncover it without endangering its security.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>More yet than this, the work was to be done in the face of a victorious enemy, whose outposts were within rifle-shot of our own and in sight of the capital; the only communications of the army and the government passing, as far as to the <rs>Susquehanna</rs>, through a people of very doubtful loyalty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>Moreover, the government was utterly ignorant of military affairs and incapable of judging the necessities of the situation; too often actuated by mere motives of partisan expediency instead of patriotic resolve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>The people, also, were ignorant of war, and sure to be urged to clamorous and senseless impatience by a partisan press.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>Finally, I was not only unsupported, but sometimes thwarted by <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0012.00199.01306" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, whose views often differed from my own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>Under these circumstances I had only my own unwavering sense of right to sustain me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>In spite of all threats and clamors I quietly persevered in the course I knew to be necessary for the safety of the nation, regardless of the result to my personal fortunes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>The work was accomplished, and I know of no case in history where so great a task was so thoroughly performed in so brief a period.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>It certainly was not till late in <dateStruct value="1861-11-"><month reg="11">Nov.</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, that the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was in any condition to move, nor even then were they capable of assaulting entrenched positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>By that time the roads had ceased to be practicable for the movement of armies, and the experience of subsequent years proved that no large operations could be advantageously conducted in that region during the winter season.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>Any success gained at that time in front of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> could not have been followed up, and a victory would have given us the barren possession of the field of battle, with a longer and more difficult line of supply during the rest of the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>If the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> had been in condition to move before <pb n="200" id="p.200"/>winter, such an operation would not have accorded with the general plan I had determined upon after succeeding <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0012.00200.01307" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> as general in command of the armies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>I soon ascertained that more remained to be done in the <rs>West</rs> than in the <rs>East</rs> to bring the armies to a state of efficiency, and to that end did all in my power during the <rs type="season">autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>Until my own sphere of command and responsibility was extended from the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> to all the armies, I supposed that some general plan of operations existed, but now learned that there was none such, and that utter disorganization and want of preparation pervaded the <rs>Western</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>I had supposed that they were nearly, if not quite, in condition to act, but found that I was mistaken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>Even if the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> had been in condition to undertake a campaign in the, autumn of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the backward state of affairs in the <rs>West</rs> would have made it unwise to do so; for on no sound military principle could it be regarded as proper to operate on <num value="1">one</num> line alone while all was quiescent on the others, as such a course would have enabled the enemy to concentrate everything on the <num value="1">one</num> active army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>When I learned that it was possible for the gunboats to reach the <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName> above <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>, <num value="2">two</num> operations suggested themselves to my mind as its immediate results:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num></hi>. The capture of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> by a <hi rend="italics">coup de main</hi>, the result of an instantaneous advance and attack by the army and navy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>The time for this has passed, and your letter indicates that you are not accountable for the failure to seize the propitious moment, but that, on the contrary, you perceived its advantages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num></hi>. To isolate <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>, cut off its supplies, and at least facilitate its reduction by a bombardment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>Although we have a long delay to deplore, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> course still remains open to us; and I strongly advise the close blockade of <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName>, and its bombardment as soon as the <num value="13">13</num>-inch mortars and heavy guns reach you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>I am confident you can thus reduce it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>With <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Pulaski</placeName> you gain all that is really essential: you obtain complete control of the harbor, you relieve the blockading fleet, and render the main body of your force disposable for other operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>I do not consider the possession of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> worth a siege <pb n="212" id="p.212"/>after <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName> is in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>But the possession of <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName> is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>But, after all, the greatest moral effect would be produced by the reduction of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and its defences.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/>The object of your expedition is <num value="1">one</num> of vital importance &mdash; the capture of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>The route selected is up the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> obstacle to be encountered (perhaps the only <num value="1">one</num>) is in the resistance offered by <placeName key="tgn,7017764" n="1.000 1" reg="Buras, Plaquemines, Louisiana">Forts St. Philip</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Jackson</placeName>. It is expected that the navy can reduce these works; in that case you will, after their capture, leave a sufficient garrison in them to render them perfectly secure; and it is recommended that, on the upward passage, a fern heavy guns and some troops be left at the pilot station (at the forks of the river) to cover a retreat in the event of a disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>These troops and guns will, of course, be removed as soon as the forts are captured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>Should the navy fail to reduce the works you will land your forces and siege-train, and endeavor to breach the works, silence their fire, and carry them by assault.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>The next resistance will be near the <placeName reg="English Bend">English Bend</placeName>, where there are some earthen batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>Here it may be necessary for you to land your troops and co-operate with the naval attack, although it is more than probable that the navy unassisted can accomplish the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>If these works are taken the city of <placeName reg="New Orleans, Orleans, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014214">New Orleans</placeName> necessarily falls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>In that event it will probably be best to occupy <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName> with the mass of your troops, also the eastern bank of the river above the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>It may be necessary to place some troops <hi rend="italics">in</hi> the city to preserve order ; but if there appears to be sufficient Union sentiment to control the city, it may be best for purposes of discipline to keep your men out of the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>After obtaining possession of New Orleans it will be necessary to reduce all the works guarding its approaches from the east, and particularly to gain the <placeName reg="Manchac pass">Manchac pass</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>Then endeavor to open your communication with the northern column by the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, always bearing in mind the necessity of occupying <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> as soon as you can safely do so, either after or before you have effected the <pb n="214" id="p.214"/>junction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>When that object is accomplished to its fullest extent it will be necessary to make a combined attack on <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, in order to gain possession of the harbor and works, as well as to control the railway terminus at the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>In regard to this I will send more detailed instructions as the operations of the northern column develop themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>I may briefly state that the general objects of the expedition are, <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> the reduction of New Orleans and all its approaches; then <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> and its defences; then <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName>, etc.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>It is probable that by the time New Orleans is reduced it will be in the power of the government to reinforce the land forces sufficiently to accomplish all these objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/>In the meantime you will please give all the assistance in your power to the army and navy commanders in your vicinity, never losing sight of the fact that the great object to be achieved is the capture and firm retention of New Orleans.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>You will the more readily comprehend the state of affairs when I remind you that my <pb n="220" id="p.220"/>predecessor, <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0012.00220.01443" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Thomas,A.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, had an office--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in New York, afterwards in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> &mdash; entirely distinct from that of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs> of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>I changed the arrangement, dispensed with the machinery of a separate office, and merged all the routine service and records of the command-in-chief with those of the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>'s office</orgName>. The only papers, to the best of my recollection, kept in my office were the retained copies of my own letters on subjects of an important nature requiring more or less secrecy, such as letters of instruction in regard to military movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>As the telegraph was much used, these letters were not numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>I kept nothing for myself but the original rough drafts, either in my own handwriting or that of the aides to whom they were dictated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>All written reports received went finally to the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>'s office</orgName> or that of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>; none were retained in my office, which was, after all, simply a place for the transaction of business, and not a place of record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>When I left <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1862-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, to accompany the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> on its march towards <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, I was still the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>I therefore made no special arrangements in regard to my office in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and left everything as it happened to be, all my personal aides accompanying me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>I was informed that it was <hi rend="italics">immediately</hi> taken possession of by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> for its own uses, and have no knowledge of what disposition was made of the papers, etc., found there, further than that it was about the same time stated to me that the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> had taken possession of everything in the office, as the functions of commanding general were assumed by the secretary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>All telegraphic despatches of any importance were sent and received in cipher, and were handed to me translated; the work of deciphering, and the reverse, being executed in the telegraph-office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>My recollection is that the cipher copies, at least, were recorded in books, which were kept in the chief telegraph-office; these books were never in my personal possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>This chief office, originally organized under my direction, was in the building occupied as the headquarters of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>. <pb n="221" id="p.221"/>on <placeName reg="Pennsylvania avenue">Pennsylvania avenue</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jackson Square, Jackson, Missouri" key="tgn,2059212">Jackson square</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>When I returned to the city I found the removal accomplished, which was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation I had of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>In that office should be found copies of all the messages that passed through it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>With regard to the books containing the original duplicates of my messages sent, I have now no means of knowing what ones were left in my <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> office when it passed from my possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>I do not think there are any in my possession (among my papers in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>) except that sent to you by <persName n="Marcy,General,,,," id="n-0001.0012.00221.01445" reg="mostcommon:Marcy,Randolph,B.,,:12"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Marcy</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>I will do my best to aid him in making a thorough search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>It was issued without consulting me and against my judgment, for from the beginning it had been my intention to postpone the formation of <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> until service in the field had indicated what general officers were best fitted to exercise those most important commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>In the course of the evening I determined to move the whole army forward, partly with the hope that I might be able to take advantage of some accident and bring <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00222.01456" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joe,,,:10"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> to battle under favorable circumstances, but also to break up the camps, give the troops a little experience in marching and bivouac before finally leaving the old base of supplies, to test the transportation arrangements and get rid of <hi rend="italics">impedimenta</hi>, and thus prepare things for the movement to the <name type="place">Peninsula</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>You have entirely misunderstood me, and the idea I intended to convey was simply that I could not, under the pressure of the new aspect of affairs, immediately carry out the <rs>President</rs>'s order as to the formation of <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>. It is absolutely necessary that I should at once move divisions as they stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>If you require me to suspend movements until <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> can be formed, I will do so, but I regard it as a military necessity that the divisions should move to the front at once without waiting for the formation of <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>I only wish to avoid giving any sanction to a suspension of a policy which the <rs>President</rs> has ordered to be pursued; but if you think that the terms of the order as it stands would operate to retard or in any way restrain movements that circumstances require to be made before the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> are formed, I will assume the responsibility of suspending the order for that purpose, and authorize you to make any movement, by division or otherwise, to your own judgment, without stopping to form the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>. My desire is that you should exercise every power that you think present circumstances require to be exercised without delay, but I want that you and I should not seem to be desirous of opposing any order of the <rs>President</rs> without necessity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>Sir: I ask your indulgence for the following papers, rendered necessary by circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>I assumed command of the troops in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> on <dateStruct value="1861-07-27"><day type="name">Saturday</day>, <month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="27">27</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> after the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>I found no army to command &mdash; a mere collection of regiments cowering on the banks of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>, some perfectly raw, others dispirited by the recent defeat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>Nothing of any consequence had been done to secure the southern approaches to the capital by means of defensive works; nothing whatever had been undertaken to defend the avenues to the city on the northern side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/><pb n="230" id="p.230"/></p> 
<p>The troops were not only undisciplined, undrilled, and dispirited; they were not even placed in military positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>The city was almost in a condition to have been taken by a dash of a regiment of cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>Without <num value="1">one</num> day's delay I undertook the difficult task assigned to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>That task the honorable secretary knows was given to me without solicitation or foreknowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>How far I have accomplished it will best be shown by the past and the present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>The capital is secure against attack; the extensive fortifications erected by the labor of our troops enable a small garrison to hold it against a numerous army; the enemy have been held in check; the <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">State of Maryland</placeName> is securely in our possession, the detached counties of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> are again within the pale of our laws, and all apprehension of trouble in <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName> is at an end; the enemy are confined to the positions they occupied before the disaster of the <dateStruct value="-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>. More than all this, I have now under my command a well-drilled and reliable army, to which the destinies of the country may be confidently committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>This army is young and untried in battle, but it is animated by the highest spirit and is capable of great deeds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>That so much has been accomplished and such an army created in so short a time from nothing will hereafter be regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the highest glories of the administration and the nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>Many weeks &mdash; I may say many months &mdash; ago this <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was fully in condition to repel any attack; but there is a vast difference between that and the efficiency required to enable troops to attack successfully an army elated by victory and entrenched in a position long since selected, studied, and fortified.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>In the earliest papers I submitted to the <rs>President</rs> I asked for an effective and movable force far exceeding the aggregate now on the banks of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>I have not the force I asked for.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/>Even when in a subordinate position I always looked beyond the operations of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>. I was never satisfied in my own mind with a barren victory, but looked to combined and decisive operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>When I was placed in command of the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> I immediately turned my attention to the whole field of operations, regarding the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> as only <num value="1">one</num>, while the most important, of the masses under my command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>I confess that I did not then appreciate the total absence of a general plan which had before existed, nor did I know that utter disorganization and want of preparation pervaded the <rs>Western</rs> armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>I took it for granted that they were nearly, if not quite, in <pb n="231" id="p.231"/>condition to move towards the fulfilment of my plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>I acknowledge that I made a great mistake.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/>I sent at once, with the approval of the executive, officers I considered competent to command in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>. Their instructions looked to prompt movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>I soon found that the labor of creation and organization had to be performed there; transportation, arms, clothing, artillery, discipline &mdash; all were wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/>These things required time to procure them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/>The generals in command have done their work most creditably, but we are still delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>I had hoped that a general advance could be made during the good weather of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>; I was mistaken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3277"/>My wish was to gain possession of the <orgName n="Eastern Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Eastern Tennessee Railroad</orgName> as a preliminary movement, then to follow it up immediately by an attack on <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, as nearly at the same time as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>I have ever regarded our true policy as being that of fully preparing ourselves, and then seeking for the most decisive results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>I do not wish to waste life in useless battles, but prefer to strike at the heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/><num value="2">Two</num> bases of operations seem to present themselves for the advance of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>. That of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00231.01485" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> &mdash; its present position &mdash; involving a direct attack upon the entrenched positions of the enemy at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, etc., or else a movement to turn <num value="1">one</num> or both flanks of those positions, or a combination of the <num value="2">two</num> plans.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>The relative force of the <num value="2">two</num> armies will not justify an attack on both flanks; an attack on his left flank alone involves a long line of wagon communication, and cannot prevent him from collecting for the decisive battle all the detachments now on his extreme right and left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>Should we attack his right flank by the line of the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, and a crossing of the <rs>Potomac</rs> below that river and near his batteries, we could perhaps prevent the junction of the enemy's right with his centre (we might destroy the former); we would remove the obstructions to the navigation of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, reduce the length of wagon transportation by establishing new depots at the nearest points of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and strike more directly his main railway communication.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>The fords of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> below the mouth of the <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> are watched by the rebels; batteries are said to be placed on the heights in the rear (concealed by the woods), and the arrangement of his troops is such that he can oppose some considerable resistance to a passage of that stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>Information has just been received to the effect that the enemy are entrenching a line of heights extending from the vicinity of <persName n="Sangster,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00231.01486" reg="mostcommon:Sangster,nomatch:0"><surname>Sangster</surname></persName>'s (<placeName reg="Manassas National Battlefield Park, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Union Mills</placeName>) towards <placeName reg="Evansport, Defiance, Ohio" key="tgn,2079480">Evansport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>Early in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> <placeName reg="Spriggs's ford">Spriggs's ford</placeName> was occupied <pb n="232" id="p.232"/>by <persName n="Rhodes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00232.01487" reg="mostcommon:Rhodes,R.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rhodes</surname></persName> with <num value="3600">3,600</num> men and <num value="8">eight</num> (<num value="8">8</num>) guns; there are strong reasons for believing that <placeName reg="Davis's ford">Davis's ford</placeName> is occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>These circumstances indicate or prove that the enemy anticipates the movement in question, and is prepared to resist it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>Assuming for the present that this operation is determined upon, it may be well to examine briefly its probable progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>In the present state of affairs our column (for the movement of so large a force must be made in several columns, at least <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num>) can reach the <rs>Accotink</rs> without danger; during the march thence to the <rs>Occoquan</rs> our right flank becomes exposed to an attack from <placeName reg="Fairfax Station, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111701">Fairfax Station</placeName>, <persName n="Sangster,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00232.01488" reg="mostcommon:Sangster,nomatch:0"><surname>Sangster</surname></persName>'s, and <placeName reg="Manassas National Battlefield Park, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Union Mills</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/>This danger must be met by occupying in some force either the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-named places, or, better, the point of junction of the roads leading thence to the village of <placeName reg="Occoquan, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,2113485">Occoquan</placeName>; this occupation must be continued so long as we continue to draw supplies by the roads from this city, or until a battle is won.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>The crossing of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> should be made at all the fords from <placeName reg="Wolf Run, Knox, Ohio" key="tgn,2779758">Wolf's Run</placeName> to the mouth, the points of crossing not being necessarily confined to the fords themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>Should the enemy occupy this line in force we must, with what assistance the flotilla can afford, endeavor to force the passage near the mouth, thus forcing the enemy to abandon the whole line or be taken in flank himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>Having gained the line of the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, it would be necessary to throw a column by the shortest route to <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, partly to force the enemy to abandon his batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs>, partly to cover our left flank against an attack from the direction of Acquia, and, lastly, to establish our communications with the river by the best roads, and thus give us new depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>The enemy would by this time have occupied the line of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> above <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, holding <placeName key="tgn,2110773" n="1.000 8" reg="brentsville, prince william, virginia">Brentsville</placeName> in force, and perhaps extending his lines somewhat further to the southwest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/>Our next step would then be to prevent the enemy from crossing the <rs>Occoquan</rs> between <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and <placeName reg="Broad Run, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2195788">Broad Run</placeName>, to fall upon our right flank while moving on <placeName key="tgn,2110773" n="1.000 8" reg="brentsville, prince william, virginia">Brentsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>This might be effected by occupying <placeName reg="Bacon Race church">Bacon Race church</placeName> and the cross-roads near the mouth of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, or still more effectually by moving to the fords themselves and preventing, him from debouching on our side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/>These operations would possibly be resisted, and it would require some time to effect them, as, nearly at the same time as possible, we should gain the fords necessary to our purposes above <placeName reg="Broad Run, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2195788">Broad Run</placeName>. Having secured our right flank, it would become necessary to carry <placeName key="tgn,2110773" n="1.000 8" reg="brentsville, prince william, virginia">Brentsville</placeName> at any cost, for we could not leave it between the right flank and the main body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>The final movement on the railroad must be determined by circumstances existing at the time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>This brief sketch brings out in bold relief the great advantage <pb n="233" id="p.233"/>possessed by the enemy in the strong central position he occupies, with roads diverging in every direction, and a strong line of defence enabling him to remain on the defensive, with a small force on <num value="1">one</num> flank, while he concentrates everything on the other for a decisive action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>Should we place a portion of our force in front of <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, while the rest crosses the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, we commit the error of dividing our army by a very difficult obstacle, and by a distance too great to enable the <num value="2">two</num> parts to support each other, should either be attacked by the masses of the enemy while the other is held in check.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>I should perhaps have dwelt more decidedly on the fact that the force left near <persName n="Sangster,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00233.01489" reg="mostcommon:Sangster,nomatch:0"><surname>Sangster</surname></persName>'s must be allowed to remain somewhere on that side of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> until the decisive battle is over, so as to cover our retreat in the event of disaster, unless it should be decided to select and entrench a new base somewhere near <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> &mdash; a proceeding involving much time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>After the passage of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> by the main army this covering force could be drawn into a more central and less exposed position &mdash; say <placeName reg="Brimstone Hill, Washington, New York" key="tgn,2195133">Brimstone Hill</placeName> or nearer the <rs>Occoquan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>In this latitude the weather will for a considerable period be very uncertain, and a movement commenced in force on roads in tolerably firm condition will be liable, almost certain, to be much delayed by rains and snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>It will, therefore, be best to impossible to surprise the enemy or take him at a disadvantage by rapid manoeuvres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>Our slow progress will enable him to divine our purposes and take his measures accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>The probability is, from the best information we possess, that the enemy has improved the roads leading to his lines of defence, while we have to work as we advance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>Bearing in mind what has been said, and the present unprecedented and impassable condition of the roads, it will be evident that no precise period can be fixed upon for the movement on this line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>Nor can its duration be closely calculated; it seems certain that many weeks may elapse before it is possible to commence the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>Assuming the success of this operation, and the defeat of the enemy as certain, the question at once arises as to the importance of the results gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>I think these results would be confined to the possession of the field of battle, the evacuation of the line of the upper Potomac by the enemy, and the moral effect of the victory &mdash; important results, it is true, but not decisive of the war, nor securing the destruction of the enemy's main army, for he could fall back upon other positions and fight us again and again, should the condition of his troops permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>If he is in no condition to fight us again out of the range of the entrenchments at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, we would find it a very difficult and tedious matter to follow him up there, for he would destroy his railroad bridges and otherwise impede our progress <pb n="234" id="p.234"/>through a region where the roads are as bad as they well can be, and we would probably find ourselves forced at last to change the whole theatre of war, or to seek a shorter land route to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, with a smaller available force and at an expenditure of much more time, than were we to adopt the short line at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>We would also have forced the enemy to concentrate his forces and perfect his defensive measures at the very points where it is desirable to strike him when least prepared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>. The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> base of operations available for the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> is that of the lower <placeName reg="Chesapeake Bay, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7013592">Chesapeake bay</placeName>, which affords the shortest possible land route to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and strikes directly at the heart of the enemy's power in the east.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>The roads in that region are passable at all seasons of the year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>The country now alluded to is much more favorable for offensive operations than that in front of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> (which is <hi rend="italics">very</hi> unfavorable): much more level, more cleared land, the woods less dense, the soil more sandy, and the spring some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> earlier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>A movement in force on that line obliges the enemy to abandon his entrenched position at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, in order to hasten to cover <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>He <hi rend="italics">must</hi> do this; for should he permit us to occupy <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> his destruction can be averted only by entirely defeating us in a battle in which he must be the assailant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>This movement, if successful, gives us the capital, the communications, the supplies of the rebels; <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> would fall; all the waters of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> would be ours; all <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would be in our power, and the enemy forced to abandon <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>. The alternative presented to the enemy would be, to beat us in a position selected by ourselves, disperse, or pass beneath the <placeName reg="Caudine Forks">Caudine Forks</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>Should we be beaten in a battle we have a perfectly secure retreat down the <name type="place">Peninsula</name> upon <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>, with our flanks perfectly covered by the fleet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>During the whole movement our left flank is covered by the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>Our right is secure, for the reason that the enemy is too distant to reach us in time; he can only oppose us in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>We bring our fleet into full play.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>After a successful battle our position would be &mdash; <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01490" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,A.,E.,,:4"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> forming our left; <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> held securely: our centre connecting <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01491" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,A.,E.,,:4"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> with <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01492" reg="nearbymention:Buell,D.,C.,,"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>, both by <persName n="Raleigh,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01493" reg="mostcommon:Raleigh,nomatch:0"><surname>Raleigh</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>; <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01494" reg="nearbymention:Buell,D.,C.,,"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Alabama</placeName>; <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01495" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> at Nashvilie and <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>The next movement would be to connect with <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01496" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:6"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> on the left by reducing <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>; to advance our centre into <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>; to push <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01497" reg="nearbymention:Buell,D.,C.,,"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> either towards <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> or to unite with the main army in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>; to throw <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00234.01498" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> southward to meet the naval expedition from New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/><pb n="235" id="p.235"/></p> 
<p>We should then be in a condition to reduce at our leisure all the <rs>Southern</rs> seaports; to occupy all the avenues of communication; to use the great outlet of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>; to re-establish our government and arms in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>; to force the slaves to labor for our subsistence instead of that of the rebels; to bid defiance to all foreign interference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>Such is the object I have ever had in view; this is the general plan which I hope to accomplish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/>For many long months I have labored to prepare the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> to play its part in the programme; from the day when I was placed in command of all our armies I have exerted myself to place all the other armies in such a condition that they, too, could perform their allotted duties.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>This point is easily reached by vessels of heavy draught; it is neither occupied nor observed by the enemy; it is but <num value="1">one</num> march from <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, the key of that region, and thence but <num value="2">two</num> marches to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>To reach whatever point may be selected as a base, a large amount of cheap water transportation must be collected, consisting mainly of canal-boats, barges, mood-boats, schooners, etc., towed by small steamers, all of a very different character from those required for all previous expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>This can certainly be accomplished within <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> from the time the order is given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>I propose, as the best possible plan that can, in my judgment, be adopted, to select <placeName reg="Urbanna, Middlesex, Virginia" key="tgn,2114705">Urbana</placeName> as a landing-place for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> detachments; to transport by water <num value="4">four</num> divisions of infantry with their batteries, the regular infantry, a fern wagons, <num value="1">one</num> bridge-train, and a few squadrons of cavalry, making the vicinity of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0013.00235.01500" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,J.,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s position the place of embarkation for as many as possible; to move the regular cavalry and <orgName n="Reserve Artillery" type="artillery">reserve artillery</orgName>, the remaining bridge-trains and wagons, to a point somewhere near <placeName reg="Cape Lookout, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2220499">Cape Lookout</placeName>, then ferry them over the river by means of <placeName key="tgn,1122419" n="1.000 10" reg="Calfpasture, Virginia, United States">North river</placeName> ferry-boats, march them over to the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> (covering the movement by an infantry force near <placeName key="tgn,2112200" n="1.000 3" reg="heathsville, northumberland, virginia">Heathsville</placeName>), and <pb n="236" id="p.236"/>to cross the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> in a similar way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>The expense and difficulty of the movement will then be very much diminished (a saving of transportation of about <num value="10000">10,000</num> horses) and the result none the less certain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>The concentration of the cavalry, etc., on the lower counties of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> can be effected without exciting suspicion, and the movement made without delay from that cause.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>I fully realize that in all projects offered time will probably be the most valuable consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>It is my decided opinion that, in that point of view, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> plan should be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>It is possible, nay, highly probable, that the weather and state of the roads may be such as to delay the direct movement from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, with its unsatisfactory results and great risks, far beyond the time required to complete the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> plan.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>My judgment, as a general, is clearly in favor of this project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>Nothing is certain in war, but all the chances are in favor of this movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>So much am I in favor of the southern line of operations that I would prefer the move from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> as a base, as a certain though less brilliant movement than that from <placeName reg="Urbanna, Middlesex, Virginia" key="tgn,2114705">Urbana</placeName>, to an attack upon Mannssas.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3791"/>To-day I have learned that the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName>, which by the <rs>President</rs>'s order was to embrace <num value="4">four</num> divisions, and <num value="1">one</num> division (<persName n="Blenker,,,,," id="n-0001.0016.00268.01780" reg="mostcommon:Blenker,L.,,,:2"><surname>Blenker</surname></persName>'s) of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 2">2d corps</orgName>, have been withdrawn altogether from this line of operations and from the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3793"/>This army being reduced by <num value="45000">forty-five thousand</num> troops, some of them among the best in the service, and without the support of the navy, the plan to which we are reduced bears scarcely any resemblance to the <num value="1">one</num> I voted for.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3794"/>I command the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> column, and I left my camp near <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> the morning of the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="4">4th instant</day></dateStruct>. I only succeeded in getting my artillery ashore the afternoon of the day before, and <num value="1">one</num> of my divisions had not all arrived in camp the day I left, and for the want of transportation has not yet joined me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3795"/>So you will observe that not a day was lost in the advance, and in fact we marched so quickly and so rapidly that many of our animals were <num value="24">twenty-four</num> and <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> without a ration of forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3796"/>But, notwithstanding the rapidity of our advance, we were stopped by a line of defence <num value="9">nine</num> or <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> long, strongly fortified by breastworks, erected nearly the whole distance behind a stream or succession of ponds, nowhere fordable, <num value="1">one</num> terminus being <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> and the other ending in the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, which is commanded by the enemy's gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/><placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> is fortified all around with bastioned works, and on the water-side it and <placeName reg="Gloucester, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111950">Gloucester</placeName> are so strong that the navy are afraid to attack either.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/>The approaches on <num value="1">one</num> side are generally through low, swampy, or thickly wooded ground, over roads which we are obliged to repair or to make before we can get forward our carriages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3799"/>The enemy is in great force, and is constantly receiving reinforcements from the <num value="2">two</num> rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3800"/>The line in front of us is therefore <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest ever opposed to an invading force in any country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>You will, then, ask why I advocated such a line for our operations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3802"/>My reasons are few but, I think, good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3803"/>With proper assistance from the navy we could take <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, and then with gunboats on both rivers we could beat any force opposed to us on <placeName reg="Warwick, Accomack, Virginia" key="tgn,1131642">Warwick river</placeName>, because the shot and shell <pb n="269" id="p.269"/>from the gunboats would nearly overlap across the <name type="place">Peninsula</name>; so that if the enemy should retreat &mdash; and retreat he must &mdash; he would have a long way to go without rail or steam transportation, and every soul of his army must fall into our hands or be destroyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>Another reason for my supporting the new base and plan was that this line, it was expected, would furnish water-transportation nearly to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3805"/>Now, supposing we succeed in breaking through the line in front of us, what can we do next?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/>The roads are very bad, and if the enemy retains command of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and we do not <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reduce <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, it would be impossible for us to subsist this army <num value="3">three</num> marches beyond where it is now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>As the roads are at present, it is with the utmost difficulty that we can subsist it in the position it now occupies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/>You will see, therefore, by what I have said, that the force originally intended for the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> should be all sent forward.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>At the risk of being thought obtrusive I will venture upon some remarks which perhaps my position does not justify me in making, but which I beg to assure you are induced solely by my intense desire for the success of the government in this struggle.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>You will, I hope, pardon me if I allude to the past, not in a captious spirit, but merely so far as may be necessary to explain my own course and my views as to the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3985"/>From the beginning I had intended, so far as I might have the power to carry out my own views, to abandon the line of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> as the line of advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>I ever regarded it as an improper <num value="1">one</num>; my wish was to adopt a new line, based upon the waters of the lower <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>I always expected to meet with strong opposition on this line, the strongest that the rebels could offer, but I was well aware that upon overcoming this opposition the result would be decisive and pregnant with great results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>Circumstances, among which I will now only mention the uncertainty as to the power of the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, have compelled me to adopt the present line, as probably safer, though far less brilliant, than that by <placeName reg="Urbanna, Middlesex, Virginia" key="tgn,2114705">Urbana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>When the movement was commenced I counted upon an active and disposable force of nearly <num value="150000">150,000</num> men, and intended to throw a strong column upon <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> either by <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York river</placeName> or, if that proved impracticable, by a march from the mouth of the <placeName reg="Severn River, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2653612">Severn</placeName>, expecting to turn in that manner all the defences of the <name type="place">Peninsula</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>Circumstances have proved that I was right, and that my intended movements would have produced the desired results.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>As soon as the mass of my troops were fairly started I embarked myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3993"/>Upon reaching <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> I learned that the rebels were being rapidly reinforced from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3994"/>I therefore determined to lose no time in making the effort to invest <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, without waiting for the arrival of the <orgName>divisions of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0016.00282.01855" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,J.,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName></orgName> and <persName n="Richardson,,,,," id="n-0001.0016.00282.01856" reg="mostcommon:Richardson,I.,B.,,:1"><surname>Richardson</surname></persName> and the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName>, intending to employ the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName> in mass to move upon <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, reinforcing it as circumstances might render necessary.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>While my men were under fire I learned that the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName> was removed from my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>No warning had been given me of this, nor was any <pb n="283" id="p.283"/>reason then assigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3998"/>I should also have mentioned that the evening before I left <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> I received a telegraphic despatch from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> informing me that the order placing <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> and its dependent troops under my command was rescinded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>No reason was given for this, nor has it been to this day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/>I confess that I have no right to know the reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>This order deprived me of the support of another division which I had been authorized to form for active operations from among the troops near <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4002"/>Thus when I came under fire I found myself weaker by <num value="5">five</num> divisions than I had expected when the movement commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4003"/>It is more than probable that no general was ever placed in such a position before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4004"/>Finding myself thus unexpectedly weakened, and with a powerful enemy strongly entrenched in my front, I was compelled to change my plans and become cautious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4005"/>Could I have retained my original force I confidently believe that I would now have been in front of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> instead of where I now am.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4006"/>The probability is that that city would now have been in our possession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4007"/>But the question now is in regard to the present and the future rather than the past.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4008"/>The enemy, by the destruction of the bridges of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, has deprived himself of the means of a rapid advance on <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4010"/>The troops I left for the defence of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as I fully explained to you in the letter I wrote the day I sailed, are ample for its protection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4011"/>Our true policy is to concentrate our troops on the fewest possible lines of attack; we have now too many, and an enterprising enemy could strike us a severe blow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>I have every reason to believe that the main portion of the rebel forces are in my front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>They are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> <quote>drawing off</quote> their troops from <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4014"/>Give me <orgName n="division"><persName n="McCall,,,,," id="n-0001.0016.00283.01858" reg="mostcommon:McCall,George,A.,,:4"><surname>McCall</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> and I will undertake a movement on <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> which will shake them out of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/>As it is, I will win, but I must not be blamed if success is delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>In this vicinity the river, in its ordinary stage, is about <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> wide, fringed with a dense growth of heavy forest trees, and bordered by low, marshy bottom-lands varying from half a mile to a mile in width.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>Within the limits above-mentioned the firm ground lying above high-water mark seldom approaches the river on either bank, and no place was found, within this section, where the high ground came near the stream on both banks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/>It was subject to frequent, sudden, and great variations in the volume of water, and a single violent rain-storm of brief duration would cause a rise of water which overflowed the bottomlands on both sides, and for many days made the river absolutely impassable without bridges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>When our light troops approached the river on the <dateStruct value="-05-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> it was found that all the bridges had been destroyed by the enemy on our approach, except that at <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, and it became necessary not only to rebuild the old bridges, but also to construct several additional ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5172"/>The west bank of the river, opposite <placeName reg="Newbridge, Franklin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2540014">New</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mechanicsville bridge">Mechanicsville</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Meadow Bridge, Fayette, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119163">Meadow bridges</placeName>, was bordered by high bluffs, which afforded the enemy commanding positions on which to establish his batteries, to enfilade the approaches by the principal roads leading to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on our right, and to prevent the reconstruction of these important bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5173"/>We were thus obliged to select other less exposed points for our crossings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5174"/>Had the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName> effected its promised junction we might have turned the head-waters of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> and attacked <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from the <name>north</name> and <name>north</name>west, while we preserved our <pb n="363" id="p.363"/>line of supply from <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>; but with the force actually at my disposal such an attempt would simply have exposed the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> to destruction in detail, and the total loss of its communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5175"/>It is hardly necessary to say that the country in which we operated could supply nothing for the wants of the army, and that were our communications with the depots cut and held by the enemy nothing but starvation awaited us.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5176"/>When we arrived opposite <placeName reg="Bottom's bridge">Bottom's bridge</placeName> on the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> the enemy was there in only small force, and, as it was of the utmost importance to secure a lodgment on the right bank before he could concentrate his forces and resist the passage of the stream, I ordered <orgName n="division"><persName n="Casey,,,,," id="n-0001.0022.00363.02544" reg="mostcommon:Casey,S.,,,:1"><surname>Casey</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 4">4th corps</orgName> to ford the river at once and occupy the heights on the further bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5177"/>This was promptly done, and reconnoissances were immediately pushed forward, while instant steps were taken to rebuild the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5178"/>The troops were directed to throw up defences to secure our left flank, and the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 3">3d corps</orgName> was moved up in support.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5181"/>All the information obtained from negroes, deserters, prisoners, and spies indicated that the enemy occupied in force all the approaches to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from the east, and that he intended to dispute every step of our advance beyond the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> on our left, and to resist the passage of the stream opposite our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5182"/>That their army was superior to ours in numbers seemed certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5183"/>Strong entrenchments had been constructed around the city, Up to this time I had every reason to expect that <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0022.00363.02547" reg="nearbymention:McDowell,Irwin,,,"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> would commence his march from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--26"><day reg="26">26th</day></dateStruct>, and it was only during the evening of the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num> that I received from the <rs>President</rs> the telegram, already given, announcing the suspension of his movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5184"/>So far, then, as immediate operations were concerned, it only remained for me to make the best use of the forces at my disposal, and to avail myself of all possible artificial auxiliaries, to compensate as far as possible for the inadequacy of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5185"/><pb n="364" id="p.364"/>I concurred fully with the <rs>President</rs> in his injunction, contained in his telegram of the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num>, that it was necessary, with my limited force, to move <quote>cautiously and safely,</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5186"/>In view of the peculiar character of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and the liability to sudden inundations, it became necessary to construct <num value="11">eleven</num> bridges, all long and difficult, with extensive logway approaches, and often built under fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5187"/>It will be remembered that the order for the co-operation of <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0022.00364.02548" reg="nearbymention:McDowell,Irwin,,,"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> was only suspended, not revoked; and, therefore, I could not abandon the northern approach and my communications with <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>. To cover these communications, and be prepared to effect the junction with the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName> when it advanced it was necessary to retain a portion of the army on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName>, and I could not make any serious movement with the forces on the right bank until the communications between the <num value="2">two</num> parts of the army were firmly and securely established by strong and sufficiently numerous bridges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5188"/>As the entrenchments around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were strong and heavily garrisoned, it would have been an act of madness and folly had I temporarily abandoned my communications and thrown the entire army across the stream, trusting to the chances of carrying the place by assault before the troops had exhausted the supplies carried with them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5189"/>I was not responsible for the fact that I was obliged to select a faulty and dangerous plan as the least objectionable of those from which I could choose.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5192"/>He was then a slim, long-haired boy, carelessly dressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5193"/>I thanked him for his gallantry, and asked what I could do for him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5194"/>He replied very modestly that he had nothing to ask, and evidently did not suppose that he had done anything to deserve extraordinary reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5195"/>I then asked if he would like to serve on my personal staff as an aide-de-camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5196"/>Upon this he brightened up and assured me that he would regard such service as the most gratifying he could perform; and I at once gave the necessary orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5199"/>I became much attached to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5200"/>In the later days of the war, when he commanded cavalry troops, he displayed a degree of prudence and good sense, in conducting the most dangerous expeditions, that surprised many who thought they knew him well.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5202"/>On that fatal day he simply repeated the tactics that he had so often successfully used against large bodies of <rs n="Indian people" type="group">Indians</rs>; and it is probable that he was deceived as to the strength and fighting capacity of his opponents, and that, from his want of knowledge of the details of the ground where the tragedy occurred, he was suddenly surrounded by overwhelming masses of well-armed warriors, against whom the heroic efforts of his command wasted themselves in vain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5203"/>Those who accused him of reckless rashness would, perhaps, have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to accuse him of timidity if he had not attacked, and thus allowed the enemy to escape unhurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5204"/>He died as he had lived, a gallant soldier; and his whole career was such as to force me to believe that he had good reasons for acting as he did.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5474"/>The bridges became totally useless after this corps had passed, and others on a more permanent plan were commenced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5475"/>On my way to headquarters, after the <rs n="Battle of Fair Oaks" type="battle">battle of Fair Oaks</rs>, I attempted to cross the bridge where <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0023.00384.02853" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Edwin,V.,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> had taken over his corps on the day previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5477"/>The approaches to <placeName reg="Newbridge, Franklin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2540014">New</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mechanicsville bridge">Mechanicsville bridges</placeName> were <pb n="385" id="p.385"/>also overflowed, and both of them were enfiladed by the enemy's batteries established upon commanding heights on the opposite side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5478"/>These batteries were supported by strong forces of the enemy, having numerous rifle-pits in their front, which would have made it necessary, even had the approaches been in the best possible condition, to have fought a sanguinary battle, with but little prospect of success, before a passage could have been secured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5479"/>The only available means, therefore, of uniting our forces at <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fair Oaks</placeName> for an advance on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> soon after the battle was to march the troops from <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName> and other points on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName> down to <placeName reg="Bottom's bridge">Bottom's bridge</placeName>, and thence over the <placeName reg="Williamsburg road">Williamsburg road</placeName> to the position near <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fair Oaks</placeName>, a distance of about <measure n="23miles" type="distance">twenty-three miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5480"/>In short, the idea of uniting the <num value="2">two</num> wings of the army in time to make a vigorous pursuit of the enemy, with the prospect of overtaking him before he reached <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, only <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles distant</measure> from the field of battle, is simply absurd, and was, I presume, never for a moment seriously entertained by any <num value="1">one</num> connected with the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5481"/>Therefore I held the position already gained, and completed our crossings as rapidly as possible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6039"/>The operations of this day proved the numerical superiority of the enemy, and made it evident that while he had a large army on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName>, which had already turned our right and was in position to intercept the communications with our depot at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, he was also in large force between our army and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6041"/>This might probably have been executed on either side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and if the concentration had been effected on the left bank it is possible we might, with our entire force, have defeated the enemy there; but at that time they held the roads leading to the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, so that it would have been impossible to have sent forward supply-trains in advance of the army in that direction, and the guarding of those trains would have seriously embarrassed our operations in the battle we would have been compelled to fight, if concentrated on that bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6042"/>Moreover, we would at once have been followed by the enemy's forces upon the <rs>Richmond</rs> side of the river operating upon our rear; and if, in the chances of war, we had been ourselves defeated in the effort, we would have been forced to fall back to the <placeName key="tgn,2113715" n="1.000 570" reg="port republic, rockingham, virginia">White House</placeName>, and probably to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>; and, as both our flanks and rear would then have been entirely exposed, our entire supply-train, if not the greater part of the army itself, might have been lost.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7112"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>: You have been fully informed that the rebel army is in the front, with the purpose of overwhelming us by attacking our positions or reducing us by blocking our river communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7113"/>I cannot but regard our condition as critical, and I earnestly desire, in view of possible contingencies, to lay before your excellency, for your private consideration, my general views concerning the existing state of the rebellion, although they do not strictly relate to the situation of this army or strictly come within the scope of my official duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7114"/>These views amount to convictions, and are deeply impressed upon my mind and heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7115"/>Our cause must never be abandoned; it is the cause of free institutions and self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7116"/>The Constitution and the <rs>Union</rs> must be preserved, whatever may be the cost in time, treasure, and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7117"/>If secession is successful other dissolutions are clearly to be seen in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7118"/>Let neither military disaster, political faction, nor foreign war shake your settled purpose to enforce the equal operation of the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> upon the people of every State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7119"/>The time has come when the government must determine <pb n="488" id="p.488"/>upon a civil and military policy covering the whole ground of our national trouble.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7120"/>The responsibility of determining, declaring, and supporting such civil and military policy, and of directing the whole course of national affairs in regard to the rebellion, must now be assumed and exercised by you, or our cause will be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7121"/>The Constitution gives you power sufficient even for the present terrible exigency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7122"/>This rebellion has assumed the character of war; as such it should be regarded, and it should be conducted upon the highest principles known to <name>Christian</name> civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7123"/>It should not be a war looking to the subjugation of the people of any State in any event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7124"/>It should not be at all a war upon population, but against armed forces and political organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7125"/>Neither confiscation of property, political executions of persons, territorial organization of States, or forcible abolition of slavery should be contemplated for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7126"/>In prosecuting the war all private property and unarmed persons should be strictly protected, subject only to the necessity of military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7127"/>All private property taken for military use should be paid or receipted for; pillage and waste should be treated as high crimes; all unnecessary trespass sternly prohibited, and offensive demeanor by the military towards citizens promptly rebuked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7128"/>Military arrests should not be tolerated, except in places where active hostilities exist, and oaths not required by enactments constitutionally made should be neither demanded nor received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7129"/>Military government should be confined to the preservation of public order and the protection of political rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7130"/>Military power should not be allowed to interfere with the relations of servitude, either by supporting or impairing the authority of the master, except for repressing disorder, as in other cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7131"/>Slaves contraband under the act of Congress, seeking military protection, should receive it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7132"/>The right of the government to appropriate permanently to its own service claims to slave labor should be asserted, and the right of the owner to compensation therefor should be recognized.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7133"/>This principle might be extended, upon grounds of military necessity and security, to all the slaves within a particular State, thus working manumission in such State; and in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, perhaps in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> also, and possibly even in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, the expediency of such a measure is only a question of time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7134"/>A system of policy thus constitutional and conservative, and pervaded by the influences of Christianity and freedom, would receive the support of almost all truly loyal men, would deeply impress the rebel masses and all foreign nations, and it might be humbly hoped that it would commend itself to the favor of the <name>Almighty</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7135"/>Unless the principles governing the future conduct of our struggle shall be made known and approved, the effort to obtain requisite forces will be almost hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7136"/>A declaration of radical <pb n="489" id="p.489"/>views, especially upon slavery, will rapidly disintegrate our present armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7137"/>The policy of the government must be supported by concentrations of military power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7138"/>The national forces should not be dispersed in expeditions, posts of occupation, and numerous armies, but should be mainly collected into masses and brought to bear upon the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. Those armies thoroughly defeated, the political structure which they support would soon cease to exist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7139"/>In carrying out any system of policy which you may form you will require a commander-in-chief of the army, <num value="1">one</num> who possesses your confidence, understands your views, and who is competent to execute your orders by directing the military forces of the nation to the accomplishment of the objects by you proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7256"/>I must confess that it has caused me the greatest pain I ever experienced, for I am convinced that the order to withdraw this army to <placeName reg="Aquia Creek, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1132269">Acquia creek</placeName> will prove disastrous to our cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7257"/>I fear it will be a fatal blow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7258"/>Several days are necessary to complete the preparations for so important a movement as this; and while they are in progress I beg that careful consideration may be given to my statements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7259"/>This army is now in excellent discipline and condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7260"/>We hold a debouch on both banks of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, so that we are free to act in any direction, and, with the assistance of the gunboats, I consider our communications as now secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7261"/>We are <placeName><distance reg="25miles">twenty-five miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, and are not likely to meet the enemy in force sufficient to fight a battle until we have marched <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <measure n="18miles" type="distance">eighteen miles</measure>, which brings us practically within <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7262"/>Our longest line of land-transportation would be from this point <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure>; but with the aid of the gunboats we can supply the army by water, during its advance, certainly to within <placeName><distance reg="12miles">twelve miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.</p>

<p>From here to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> is a march of about <measure n="70miles" type="distance">seventy miles</measure>; for I regard it as impracticable to withdraw this army and its material except by land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7265"/>The result of the movement would thus be a march of <measure n="145miles" type="distance">one hundred and forty-five miles</measure> to reach a point now only <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles distant</measure>, and to deprive ourselves entirely of the powerful aid of the gunboats and water-transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7266"/>Add to this the certain demoralization of this army which would ensue, the terribly depressing effect upon the people of the <rs>North</rs>, and the strong probability that it would influence foreign powers to recognize our adversaries, and there appear to me sufficient reasons to make it my imperative duty to urge, in the strongest terms afforded by our language, that this order may be rescinded, and that, far from recalling this army, it be promptly reinforced to enable it to resume the offensive.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9359"/>Of course the remainder did not in the slightest degree contribute to the efficiency of the cavalry or artillery of the army with which I was to cross the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9360"/>Neither did they in the least facilitate any preparations for carrying out the order to advance upon the enemy, as the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>'s letter might seem to imply.

<p>During the same period that we were receiving the horses alluded to about (<num value="3000">3,000</num>) <num value="3000">three thousand</num> of our old stock were turned into the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName>, and <num value="1500">1,500</num> more reported as in such condition that they ought to be turned in as unfit for service; thus leaving the active army some <num value="700">700</num> short of the number required to make good existing deficiencies, to say nothing of providing remounts for men whose horses had died or been killed during the campaign and those previously dismounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9362"/>Notwithstanding all the efforts made to obtain a remount, there were, after deducting the force engaged in picketing the river, but about a <num value="1000">thousand</num> serviceable cavalry horses on the <dateStruct value="-10-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> day of <month reg="10">Oct.</month></dateStruct></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9364"/>It is believed that your present proportion of cavalry and of animals is much larger than that of any other of our armies.</quote></p> 
<p>What number of animals our other armies had I am not prepared to say, but military men in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> armies have been of the opinion that an army to be efficient, while carrying on active operations in the field, should have a cavalry force equal in numbers to from <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the infantry force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9365"/>My cavalry did not amount to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> part of the army, and hence the necessity of giving every <num value="1">one</num> of my cavalry soldiers a serviceable horse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9366"/>Cavalry may be said to constitute the antennae of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9367"/>It scouts all the roads in front, on the flanks, and in the rear of the advancing columns, and constantly feels the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9368"/>The amount of labor falling on this arm during the <rs n="Maryland Campaign" type="campaign">Maryland campaign</rs> was excessive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9369"/>To persons not familiar with the movements of troops, and the amount of transportation required for a large army marching away from water or railroad communications, the number of animals mentioned by the general-in-chief may have appeared unnecessarily large; but to a military man who takes the trouble to enter into an accurate and detailed computation of the number of pounds of subsistence and forage required for such an army as that of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, it will be seen that the <num value="31000">31,000</num> animals were considerably less than was absolutely necessary to an advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9370"/><pb n="639" id="p.639"/></p> 
<p>As we were required to move through a country which could not be depended upon for any of our supplies, it became necessary to transport everything in wagons and to be prepared for all emergencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9371"/>I did not consider it safe to leave the river without subsistence and forage for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9372"/>The official returns of that date show the aggregate strength of the army for duty to have been about <num value="110000">110,000</num> men of all arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9373"/>This did not include teamsters, citizen employees, officers' servants, etc., amounting to some <num value="12000">12,000</num>, which gave a total of <num value="122000">122,000</num> men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9374"/>The subsistence alone of this army for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> required for its transportation <num value="1830">1,830</num> wagons at <measure n="2000l." type="pounds"><num value="2000">2,000</num> pounds</measure> to the wagon, and <num value="10980">10,980</num> animals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9375"/>Our cavalry horses at that time amounted to <num value="5046">5,046</num>, and our artillery horses to <num value="6836">6,836</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9376"/>To transport full forage for these <num value="22862">22,862</num> animals for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> required <num value="17832">17,832</num> additional animals; and this forage would only supply the entire number (<num value="40694">40,694</num>) of animals with a small fraction over half-allowance for the time specified.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9377"/>It will be observed that this estimate does not embrace the animals necessary to transport quartermasters' supplies, baggage, camp equipage, ambulances, reserve ammunition, forage for officers' horses, etc., which would greatly augment the necessary transportation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9378"/>It may very truly be said that we did make the march with the means at our disposal; but it will be remembered that we met with no serious opposition from the enemy, neither did we encounter delays from any other cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9379"/>The roads were in excellent condition, and the troops marched with the most commendable order and celerity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9380"/>If we had met with a determined resistance from the enemy, and our progress had been very much retarded thereby, we would have consumed our supplies before they could have been renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9381"/>A proper estimate of my responsibilities as the commander of that army did not justify me in basing my preparations for the expedition upon the supposition that I was to have an uninterrupted march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9382"/>On the contrary, it was my duty to be prepared for all emergencies; and not the least important of my responsibilities was the duty of making ample provision for supplying my men and animals with rations and forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9385"/>This, I am happy to say, is now nearly accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9386"/>I have also, during the same time, repeatedly urged upon you the importance of supplying cavalry and artillery horses to replace those broken down by hard service, and steps have been taken to insure a prompt delivery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9387"/>Our cavalry, even when well supplied with horses, is much inferior in number to that of the enemy, but in efficiency has proved itself superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9388"/>So forcibly has this been impressed upon our old regiments by repeated successes that the men are fully persuaded that they are equal to twice their number of rebel cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9389"/>Exclusive of the cavalry force now engaged in picketing the river, I have not at present over about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> (<num value="1000">1,000</num>) horses for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9390"/>Officers have been sent in various directions to purchase horses, and I expect them soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9391"/>Without more cavalry horses our communications, from the moment we march, would be at the mercy of the large cavalry force of the enemy, and it would not be possible for us to cover our flanks properly, or to obtain the necessary information of the position and movements of the enemy in such a way as to insure success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9392"/>My experience has shown the necessity of a large and efficient cavalry force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9393"/>Under the foregoing circumstances I beg leave to ask whether the <rs>President</rs> desires me to march on the enemy at once or to await the reception of the new horses, every possible step having been taken to insure their prompt arrival.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9400"/>From the tenor of this despatch I conceived that it was left for my judgment to decide whether or not it was possible to move with safety to the army at that time; and this responsibility I exercised with the more confidence in view of the strong assurances of his trust in me, as commander of that army, with which the <rs>President</rs> had seen fit to honor me during his last visit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9401"/>The cavalry requirements, without which an advance would have been in the highest degree injudicious and unsafe, were still wanting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9402"/>The country before us was an enemy's country, where the inhabitants furnished to the enemy every possible assistance; providing food for men and forage for animals, giving all information concerning our movements, and rendering every aid in their power to the enemy's cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9403"/>It was manifest that we should find it, as we subsequently did, a hostile district, where we could derive no aid from the inhabitants that would justify dispensing with the active co-operation of an efficient cavalry force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9404"/>Accordingly I fixed upon the <dateStruct value="-11-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> as the earliest date at which the forward movement could well be commenced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9405"/>The <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, in a letter to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> on the <dateStruct value="-10-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="10">Oct.</month></dateStruct>, says: <quote>In my opinion there has been no such want of supplies in the army under <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0038.00641.05341" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> as to prevent his compliance with the orders to advance against the enemy.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9406"/>Notwithstanding this opinion, expressed by such high authority, I am compelled to say again that the delay in the reception of necessary supplies up to that date had left the army in a condition totally unfit to advance against the enemy; that an advance under the existing circumstances would, in my judgment, have been attended with the highest degree of peril, with great suffering and sickness among the men, and with imminent danger of being cut off from our supplies by the superior cavalry force of the enemy, and with no reasonable prospect of gaining any advantage over him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9407"/>I dismiss this subject with the remark that I have found it impossible to resist the force of my own convictions that the commander of an army who, from the time of its organization, has for <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> been in constant communication with its officers and men, the greater part of the time engaged in active <pb n="642" id="p.642"/>service in the field, and who has exercised this command in many battles, must certainly be considered competent to determine whether his army is in proper condition to advance on the enemy or not; and he must necessarily possess greater facilities for forming a correct judgment in regard to the wants of his men and the condition of his supplies than the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> in his office at <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9408"/>The movement from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, which culminated in the battles of <placeName reg="South Mountain, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681169">South Mountain</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName>, was not a part of an offensive campaign, with the object of the invasion of the enemy's territory and an attack upon his capital, but was defensive in its purposes, although offensive in its character, and would be technically called a <quote>defensive-offensive campaign.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9409"/>It was undertaken at a time when our army had experienced severe defeats, and its object was to preserve the national capital and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, to protect <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> from invasion, and to drive the enemy out of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>. These purposes were fully and finally accomplished by the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs>, which brought the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> into what might be termed an accidental position on the upper Potomac.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9410"/>Having gained the immediate object of the campaign, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to be done was to insure <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> from a return of the enemy; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to prepare our own army-exhausted by a series of severe battles, destitute to a great extent of supplies, and very deficient in artillery and cavalry horses &mdash; for a definite offensive movement, and to determine upon the line of operations for a further advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9411"/>At the time of the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs> the <rs>Potomac</rs> was very low, and presented a comparatively weak line of defence unless watched by large masses of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9412"/>The reoccupation of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> and the disposition of troops above that point rendered the line of the <rs>Potomac</rs> secure against everything except cavalry raids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9413"/>No time was lost in placing the army in proper condition for an advance, and the circumstances which caused the delay after the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs> have been fully enumerated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9414"/>I never regarded <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> or its vicinity as a proper base of operations for a movement upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9415"/>I still considered the line of the <name type="place">Peninsula</name> as the true approach, but for obvious reasons did not make any proposal to return to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9416"/>On the <dateStruct value="-10-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="10">Oct.</month></dateStruct>, as stated above, I was ordered by the <pb n="643" id="p.643"/><rs type="role2">President</rs>, through his general-in-chief, to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> and give battle to the enemy or drive him south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9417"/><num value="2">Two</num> lines were presented for my choice:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9418"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9419"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9420"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I determined to adopt the line of the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>, for these reasons: The <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> and <orgName n="Winchester Railroad" type="railroad">Winchester Railroad</orgName>, and the various turnpikes converging upon <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, afforded superior facilities for supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9421"/>Our cavalry being weak, this line of communication could be more easily protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9422"/>There was no advantage in interposing at that time the <placeName reg="Blue Ridge, Botetourt, Virginia" key="tgn,2110717">Blue Ridge</placeName> and the <rs>Shenandoah</rs> between the enemy and myself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9423"/>At the period in question the <rs>Potomac</rs> was still very low, and I apprehended that if I crossed the river below <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> the enemy would promptly check the movement by recrossing into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, at the same time covering his rear by occupying in strong force the passes leading through the <placeName reg="Blue Ridge, Botetourt, Virginia" key="tgn,2110717">Blue Ridge</placeName> from the southeast into the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9424"/>I anticipated, as the result of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> course, that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0038.00643.05342" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,:3"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> would fight me near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, if he could do so under favorable circumstances; or else that he would abandon the lower <rs>Shenandoah</rs>, and leave the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> free to act upon some other line of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9425"/>If he abandoned the <rs>Shenandoah</rs> he would naturally fall back upon his railway communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9426"/>I have since been confirmed in the belief that if I had crossed the <rs>Potomac</rs> below <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> in the early part of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0038.00643.05343" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> would have recrossed into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9427"/>As above explained, the army was not in condition to move until late in <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> and in the meantime circumstances had changed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9428"/>The period had arrived when a sudden and great rise of the <rs>Potomac</rs> might be looked for at any moment; the season of bad roads and difficult movements was approaching, which would naturally deter the enemy from exposing himself very far from his base, and his movements all appeared to indicate a falling back from the river towards his supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9429"/>Under these circumstances <pb n="644" id="p.644"/>I felt at liberty to disregard the possibility of the enemy's, recrossing the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and determined to select the line east of the <placeName reg="Blue Ridge, Botetourt, Virginia" key="tgn,2110717">Blue Ridge</placeName>, feeling convinced that it would secure me the largest accession of force and the most cordial support of the <rs>President</rs>, whose views from the beginning were in favor of that line.</p> 
<p>
