<head>I. The outbreak of the war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The outbreak of the <rs>Civil War</rs> found <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and the <rs>Eastern States</rs> generally, not only in an unarmed but in a very unwarlike condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The old outdoor habits of a rural community&mdash;riding, hunting and outdoor adventure&mdash;had almost passed away, while the modern substitutes in the way of physical exercise were only just being introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The intercollegiate athletic contests had just begun, there had been <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> rowing matches, no football games; it was rarely that villages met to compete at base ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The militia had been until within a few years at a low ebb; it had indeed been lately organized into regiments, but these larger organizations were still almost nominal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>As a rule, the higher an officer, the less his military knowledge,&mdash;the major usually knew less than the captain, the colonel less than the major, the brigadier-general still less, and the major-general sometimes less than any of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The higher officers were often appointed on merely political grounds, or because they would entertain the others at their houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Stories were rife as to the blunders of these officers, of their marching the regiment up a high wall before they could remember how to stop them, or of their bewildering their command by the order (suggested by a mischievous adjutant) <q direct="unspecified"><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> paces backward, march!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Even such as it was, the militia furnished the nucleus of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> contingent, largely filled the roster of its early officers, and, by the promptness of its <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> service, did much for the actual saving of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Some of the regiments were ordered out <num value="3">three</num> successive times and responded promptly every time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>But it must not be for a moment supposed that the <rs>State</rs> militia of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> resembled at all in order and efficiency the highly organized militia of to-day; and the more flattering the titles of its officers the less prepared they usually were to assume any responsibility requiring military knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Without the line officers of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> militia <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> the <rs>State</rs> could not have met as it did the summons to the <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> service; but its general officers were often an embarrassment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It must also be remembered that the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, generally shrinking from all belief in a coming war, had delayed serious action long after active preparations had begun at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Young men coming from that region were amazed, during the winter of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">61</year></dateStruct>, to find their Northern acquaintances employing or amusing themselves as usual, while at the <rs>South</rs> everybody was drilling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>All the events in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> had not really opened men's eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Both sides, moreover, strangely underrated their opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>At the <rs>South</rs>, relying on their own more active outdoor habits, men believed that <num value="1">one</num> Southerner was a match for <num value="3">three</num> <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>; while at the <rs>North</rs> the reasoning, though proceeding from a different point, reached the same conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><q direct="unspecified">Modern war,</q> we reasoned, <q direct="unspecified">is a matter not of individual hand-to-hand contest, but of machinery, of organization, of inventive skill, of capital, of material resources.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In all these things we felt that we had the advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We did not allow for the effect of necessity in creating these very resources, nor for the fact that adversity was to call out in the <rs>South</rs> more important inventions and more triumphs of organizing skill than its years of prosperity had ever claimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> itself, by giving immense supplies of crude labor for fortifications, by supporting families and by educating the habit of command, was doubtless a power in the hands of the <rs>South</rs>, until we turned it against them by arming the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>And, again, Northern men overlooked the enormous difference between offensive and defensive war, especially in a contest spreading over so vast an extent of rough and sparsely settled country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>There was thus a general impulse, born partly of desire, to make light of the extent and difficulty of the contest.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The war governor.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>On <dateStruct value="1861-01-05"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg="5">5</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Andrew,,John,Albion,," id="n0219.0001.00005.00014" reg="default:Andrew,John,Albion,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Albion</foreName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> was inaugurated as governor of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, having been chosen to that office during the previous autumn, rather through a popular impulse than by any plans of political managers; and having received the largest popular vote given up to that time to any <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> governor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He stood before the people a figure of unique appearance and bearing,&mdash;short, stout, blue-eyed, with closely curling brown hair, smooth cheeks, and a general effect that was feminine, though very sturdily so. He entered on his duties with universal popular confidence as to his intentions, but absolutely untried as to large executive duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>His personal habits were pacific and even sedentary; he had no taste for any pageantry, least of all for that of war; yet in his very inaugural address he showed that he had grasped the situation of the country, and from that day he was, emphatically and thoroughly, the war governor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0219.0001.00005.00015" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,Albion,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> was frank, outspoken, with no concealments and little solicitude for any reserve in others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It was said at the <rs type="place">State House</rs> that his predecessors had been much given to private and confidential interviews; but that he went to the other extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Everything was aboveboard; he talked as freely among his clerks and visitors as in the most secluded privacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In preliminary negotiations, sometimes delicate and difficult, about the forming <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> of regiments, the selection of officers, the distribution of supplies, it was almost impossible to have a word of confidential intercourse with him. It was also difficult to hold him to a point; he liked to talk over his own plans and to read aloud the letters he had just written; and, as his style was rather florid and he amplified a good deal, these digressions took much precious time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Moreover, he was thin-skinned, and felt keenly any personal attack; and when he met with a thoroughly unscrupulous and tormenting opponent it was not hard to keep him vexed and irritated, in spite of the unselfish nobleness of his aims.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The selection of officers was of course the most perplexing part of his military work, and was that in which he made most mistakes, these arising almost wholly from his virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He said truly of himself that he had never despised any man because he was poor, because he was ignorant or because he was black; but there was always a chance that he might overrate a man for <num value="1">one</num> or the other of these reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He began, as all war governors did, with a natural prejudice in favor of regular army men and those who had served in foreign armies; and where men had these recommendations, the fact that they had been the object of attack or criticism on other grounds told rather in their favor; unless they had taken positively pro-slavery positions or led mobs against abolitionists or negroes,&mdash;he drew the line there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can now appreciate how difficult it was, after a prolonged period of peace, to look around upon the community and say of this man or that <q direct="unspecified">He would make a good military officer.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Men did not know this in regard to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>No man could feel humbler about this process of selection than <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0219.0001.00006.00016" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,Albion,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He said once, <q direct="unspecified">It seems very absurd that I, who am a man of peace and always hated soldiering, should be the man to choose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>these officers; but <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has put this duty upon me, and I shall do it as best I can.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He was liable, as are most of us, to be misled by an imposing appearance, a commanding manner, and to underrate the obscurer virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He was over-influenced at times by trivial or temporary considerations, as when he once gave it as his reason for proposing to give <num value="1">one</num> civilian a colonelcy, that this person had wished for <num value="1">one</num> before, and had behaved very well under disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is now known, on the other hand, that the present head of the <rs>American</rs> army, <persName n="Miles,Major-General,,,," id="n0219.0001.00006.00017" reg="mostcommon:Miles,Nelson,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Miles</surname></persName>, was set aside by <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0219.0001.00006.00018" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,Albion,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> at the last moment as too young for the command of <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> a company which he had raised at his own expense; although the governor of New York had afterwards the discernment, after <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> battles, to take this young officer from his lieutenancy and make him colonel of a regiment.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>It is almost needless to point out that this preliminary narrative is in no sense a history of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, but merely a general sketch of the part taken in it by <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>The writer has, so far as possible, resisted the temptation to discuss the general management of military affairs, the success or failure of campaigns or even of particular battles, except so far as it bore on the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> contingent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>His effort has been to treat all troops of this State as if they were <num value="1">one</num> body of soldiers, included in the <rs>Union Army</rs>, but necessarily distributed on various services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>This has of course been less easy than in dealing with a State like <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, where the regiments were not only fewer, but more generally brigaded together; and it has precluded a perfectly continuous narrative, because it has been necessary to follow the varying lines of several simultaneous campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>It has not been attempted to give the separate regimental histories, except in a highly condensed form, and this partly because it has already been so well done in a general way, in <persName n="Bowen,,,,," id="n0219.0002.00132.02156" reg="mostcommon:Bowen,James,L.,,:1"><surname>Bowen</surname></persName>'s valuable <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> in the <rs>War</rs>, that it seemed better to approach the whole matter from the collective, not the regimental, point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>The story is told, in short, as if it were that of a single <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, organically united, but constantly distributed over different localities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>Less than half of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> regiments have had their histories even ostensibly written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>Some of these histories were of the most sketchy character, published too soon after the war to have any value except as they might contain scattered facts or graphic isolated descriptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>In many cases the chapter given to some particular regiment in <persName n="Bowen,,,,," id="n0219.0002.00132.02157" reg="mostcommon:Bowen,James,L.,,:1"><surname>Bowen</surname></persName>'s <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> in the <rs>War</rs> is of far more historical value than the book ostensibly devoted to it. As a rule, the most recent histories, as <orgName type="regiment" key="1Cav"><persName n="Crowninshield,,,,," id="n0219.0002.00132.02158" reg="mostcommon:Crowninshield,B.,W.,,:1"><surname>Crowninshield</surname></persName>'s 1st Cavalry</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 54"><persName n="Emilio,,,,," id="n0219.0002.00132.02159" reg="mostcommon:Emilio,L.,F.,,:1"><surname>Emilio</surname></persName>'s 54th Infantry</orgName>, are altogether the best; and it is probable that the present State law, which provides for a certain established standard in such histories, will give us much better average work hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>No <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 180" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> regimental history is on the whole so good as the best corps histories; those especially of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 2">2d Army Corps</orgName> by <persName n="Walker,General,F.,A.,," id="n0219.0002.00132.02160" reg="default:Walker,F.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> and of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 19">19th Corps</orgName> by <persName n="Irwin,,,,," id="n0219.0002.00132.02161" reg="mostcommon:Irwin,nomatch:0"><surname>Irwin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>The chief and unique value of even the poorest regimental history or company narrative lies in the flavor of actual experience there exhibited; and in this the simple autobiography or company diary is apt to surpass the more formal regimental record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>The best book which the author has had occasion to consult in this respect is <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0219.0002.00132.02162" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,W.,S.,,:4"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Life with the <orgName type="regiment" key="34MAInfantry">34th Massachusetts Infantry</orgName> in the <rs>War</rs> of the <rs>Rebellion</rs> (<placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1879--"><year reg="1879">1879</year></dateStruct>), a book making no claim to high finish or especial literary merit, but thoroughly admirable in its way.
