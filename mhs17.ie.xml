<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/><emph>I</emph> was asked by the <rs>Medford</rs> <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName> to write this sketch, as our church in <placeName>Medford</placeName> is not recorded in their archives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I found the task of giving a correct statement hedged about with many difficulties, owing to the fact that in the earlier times but few records were kept, and the men and women who began the movement <measure n="63years" type="date">sixty-three years</measure> ago have passed away, but I have tried my best.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>It will not be unprofitable to compare the numerical strength of the <name>Catholics</name> in the diocese at the time of the establishment of this parish with that at the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>In <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> the number of priests laboring in the diocese of <placeName>Boston</placeName> was <num value="65">sixty-five</num>, <num value="48">forty-eight</num> in the territory now included in said diocese, and <num value="17">seventeen</num> in what are now the dioceses of <placeName>Springfield</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fall River, Bristol, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2604119">Fall River</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The awful famine which prevailed in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> about <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> drove many of the inhabitants, with their families, to seek a living across the seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>A goodly number settled in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, and a few drifted to <placeName>Medford</placeName> in the ship-building industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>These stalwart pioneers had held tenaciously to the faith of their fathers, and had been going to <placeName>Boston</placeName> to worship in the <placeName reg="Moon">Moon</placeName> street church, to <placeName>Charlestown</placeName>, to <placeName>South Boston</placeName>, and then to North Cambridge, where <persName n="Doherty,Reverend,Manasses,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00002" reg="default:Doherty,Manasses,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Manasses</foreName> <surname>Doherty</surname></persName> officiated in <placeName reg="St. Peter's Church">St. Peter's Church</placeName>. <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> But in <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct> they felt that they were numerous enough to call for the occasional visit of a priest to minister to them in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, so they chose a committee, who waited upon the selectmen of the town, stated their object, and asked that they be allowed the use of the <rs type="place">Town</rs> <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00003" reg="mostcommon:Hall,Dudley,,,:4"><surname>Hall</surname></persName> for the celebration of the <name>Mass</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> some objection was made, but when the selectmen realized how much in earnest the petitioners were, they granted the request, only stipulating that the janitor's services should be paid for. <persName n="Doherty,Father,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00004" reg="nearbymention:Doherty,Manasses,,,"><roleName n="Father">Father</roleName> <surname>Doherty</surname></persName> of North Cambridge then came to <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> once a month to offer up the <name>Mass</name> in the <rs type="place">Town</rs> <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hall,Dudley,,,:4"><surname>Hall</surname></persName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hearing confessions in the old <placeName reg="Wade house">Wade house</placeName> on <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address> (where <persName n="Small,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Small,nomatch:0"><surname>Small</surname></persName>'s block now stands), in a room occupied by <persName n="Vaughan,Mister,Daniel,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00007" reg="default:Vaughan,Daniel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The appeal was heard, and the room set aside for tramps in the basement of the <orgName n="High School" type="school">High School</orgName> building was appointed for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Here a class was organized by <persName n="Doherty,Father,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00008" reg="nearbymention:Doherty,Manasses,,,"><roleName n="Father">Father</roleName> <surname>Doherty</surname></persName>, the teachers being the men and women of the congregation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>A conveyance owned by <persName n="Butler,Constable,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00010" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Constable">Constable</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1126718">Malden</placeName> made the trip on these <date value="--7">Sundays</date> between <placeName reg="Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1126718">Malden</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, but the round fare was <measure n="40cents" type="currency">forty cents</measure>, a prohibitive amount for the greater number of the immigrant settlers, whose pay was small and whose hardships were many.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of these journeys they heard that a priest had newly arrived from the <rs>English</rs> mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It proved to be difficult to buy land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>As <placeName reg="Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1126718">Malden</placeName> was more thickly settled than <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, it was decided to find a site in or near <placeName reg="Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1126718">Malden</placeName>, and at last the lot in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> near the <placeName reg="Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1126718">Malden</placeName> line, where the <rs>Malden</rs> convent now stands, was purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>At about the same time the zealous <rs>Catholics</rs> of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> bought a lot in the heart of that town, but it was found that the united strength of both towns was needed, and so that land was sold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>An old building stood on the lot finally bought, and it was determined to fit it up as a place of worship, but the alterations were hardly begun when the owner of the land opposite decided to sell, and the parcel was bought where the <rs>Church</rs> of the <rs>Immaculate Conception</rs> now stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The expense of this was great, but greater still was the problem of how and where to get the money to build a church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Yet out of their scanty means and poverty they found a way. A small brick edifice was soon constructed, the parishioners being the builders, and here, on <dateStruct value="1855-12-25"><occasion>Christmas morning</occasion>, <year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, the faithful were assembled for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Mass in the basement chapel of the unfinished church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Their devotion inspired them to <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> make fitting preparations for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There were paper flowers on the altar, which several of the women had made for the day's ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Evergreen and spruce trees, which the young men had cut down and drawn from the hill rising just above the church, reached from the floor to the ceiling and were banked on either side of, and behind, the altar.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>This was the earliest formal beginning of an organized Catholic society effected in this part of <placeName reg="Middlesex, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1002665">Middlesex County</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This same structure is still in use, being a part of the large Church of the <rs>Immaculate Conception</rs> (then called St. Mary's) which you see today, standing as it does, together with the rectory, on the land provided by those <orgName type="regiment" key="1Pioneers">first pioneers</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>This broke down his health, as it did that of so many others, causing him to resign from the army when he was freed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>As the latter town increased in population and wealth, so did the <name>Catholics</name> increase, and they soon began to desire a church to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>It was on the east side of <address><street n="Back street">Back street</street></address>, which perhaps is now styled Union street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>On the east the yard was fenced off from the branch canal which brought timber to the river from the <rs type="place">Middlesex canal</rs> at a point near the <rs type="place">Columbian hotel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>This mill was an instance of abominable heedlessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>Instead of delivering its escaping steam into the upper air by a high chimney, it actually delivered it into the school yard through a level pipe on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>The steam was hot, and very hot at the end of the level pipe, and poured out into a flock of <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> little people who knew no better than to dare each other to go into <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> it. I, being the youngest and the most heedless, went the farthest and was suddenly struck down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> my life was despaired of, and I was under medical treatment for weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>I never went to the <placeName reg="Back River, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2142203">Back</placeName> street school again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Fancy such a playground equipment as that steam pipe now.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Later I entered the grammar school in the rear of the <orgName n="Unitarian Church" type="church">Unitarian church</orgName> on <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Here I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw the hard realities of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>These masters were neither kind nor cruel, just the ordinary style of an ill-paid schoolmaster in a low grade school, and some of the pupils were very big, strong and unruly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>Corporal punishment was needed, or thought to be needed, very frequently indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>Sometimes a very big boy would fight against it, but he never was quite big enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>He was a man grown and was about <measure n="19years" type="date">nineteen years</measure> old, not troublesome nor noisy, but deficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>In fact he was underwitted, but we did not know it. He would sit for hours staring at his book, but ideas did not come to his poor brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>He could not learn and had to take the consequences, viz., heavy blows across the shoulders from the master's ferule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>He would keep his seat, roaring with pain, and the girls would be teary and shuddery and sometimes make little screams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>It was all very horrid indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The masters were no worse than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>It was the so-called method of education in the grammar schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>I remember nothing of the sort in the <orgName n="High School" type="school">high school</orgName> in the east end of the same building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>We had a fine large yard between the school and the <orgName n="Old Church" type="church">old church</orgName> which stood well south and paralleled the schoolhouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Our sports on it were foot-ball, tag, prisoners' base, etc., with excursions over the west fence into <persName n="Bartlett,,Squire,Abner,," id="n0334.0022.00076.00492" reg="default:Bartlett,Squire,Abner,,"><foreName>Squire</foreName> <foreName>Abner</foreName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>'s artichoke patch, and over the east fence into the orchard of the <rs>Misses Osgood</rs>; but at last the terrible <persName n="Osgood,Miss,Lucy,,," id="n0334.0022.00076.00493" reg="default:Osgood,Lucy,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Lucy</foreName> <surname>Osgood</surname></persName> caught little Gorham Train who <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> was rather slow in his return trip over that fence, and so our apple hooking came to an end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>I can fix a date at which I was in the grammar school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>In <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct> I saw the <orgName n="Old Church" type="church">old church</orgName> pulled down, and a picture of it in my possession bears that date of its destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>At the belfry, carpenters sawed the upright posts through, and by a rope attached high above, the crowd below pulled and swayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>The spire trembled, tottered and fell with a loud crash.
