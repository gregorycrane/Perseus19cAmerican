<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Printed for private circulation only, the very small edition of each pamphlet became long since exhausted; but not so the demand,--that is on the increase rather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>To that fact, and to the belief that it is well to preserve in a permanent form the living realities of the great struggle of the nation in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, this book owes its existence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The volumes heretofore published, <quote>The <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">Army of Virginia</orgName></quote> and <quote>A War Diary of events in the great Rebellion,</quote> continue, with the present volume, my history in chronological order to the end of the war. <pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/> ond <orgName type="mil" key="MAInfantry">Massachusetts Infantry</orgName> at the house, the camp and the evening parade, on the fields of the old historic <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName> at <placeName key="tgn,7015008" n="1.000 10" reg="west roxbury, suffolk county, massachusetts">West Roxbury</placeName>, are taken from large sketches of house, camp, and field, made on the ground by a private soldier of the <name>Regiment</name> during our occupancy in the spring of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>But that this does not detract from the very marked ability shown by both <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0177.0002.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0177.0002.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in taking advantage of these blunders, I cheerfully concede.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But how inadequate the militia of any State would have proved for the <rs>War</rs> of the <rs>Rebellion</rs> I need not discuss; nor need I enlarge upon their unfitness as material for the creation of a military organization for an indefinite term, and in distant States; nor to their absurd usage of the election of officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Experience brought in time condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I felt it in the beginning when the multitude, with emotions and heart-swellings and frantic cheers, heard <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0177.0004.00002.00027" reg="mostcommon:Andrew,John,A.,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>, in inspired tones, bid <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-speed to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num>, and <orgName type="regiment" key="8Militia">eighth militia regiments</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="-04-17"><day reg="17">seventeenth</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-04-18"><day reg="18">eighteenth</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Thus early in the war, at its outset, at that period when for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the country as a whole appreciated that war was inevitable, the <num value="1">one</num> thing that men of military experience felt, was that the old militia organizations must give place to new military organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>To feel thus and to act upon it was as much a matter of course as for a commander to rally in battle dispersed battalions; and to act upon it in such manner that the part each man could do, when accomplished, would form a perfect whole, was not only the part of wisdom, but of prudent foresight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>My course was plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It was to raise a regiment modelled upon the regular <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">army of the United States</orgName>,--an enlistment <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> of men; an appointment of officers; and an indefinite term of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>By what law such a regiment was to be held together, fed, paid, clothed, I knew not: there was no law; but there was something above law, something that makes law,--necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>So I addressed myself to <num value="2">two</num> essentials that were requisites for the coming law to act upon,--essentials in getting together and organizing in form a regiment of men; and these were, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the assent and cordial cooperation of <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0177.0004.00003.00028" reg="mostcommon:Andrew,John,A.,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> to raise it; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the promise of the <rs>General Government</rs> to accept it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>On the <dateStruct value="1861-04-15"><day reg="15">fifteenth</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> at the <rs type="place">State House</rs>, with the single condition that I would wait until these troops were off, <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0177.0004.00003.00029" reg="mostcommon:Andrew,John,A.,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> promised me his influence and aid in raising a regiment of troops to serve during the war: the men to be enlisted; the officers to be of my own selection; their rank to be of my own designation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>On the <dateStruct value="-04-17"><day reg="17">seventeenth</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, before all the troops were off, <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0177.0004.00003.00030" reg="mostcommon:Andrew,John,A.,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> made good the promise of his influence, by writing a letter to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, asking authority to raise a regiment,--afterwards known as the <orgName type="regiment" key="2MAInfantry">Second Massachusetts Infantry</orgName>, but then designated as a regiment to be commanded by <persName n="Gordon,Major,,,," id="n0177.0004.00003.00031" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,George,H.,,:13"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Of all the details that bear upon the design, workmanship, and completion of the fabric I cannot, in this history, do more than touch upon a few interesting incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I cannot tell even the half I know of the personal sacrifices, the heroic impulses, and the free, impetuous contributions of life and property poured out with unstinting hand, by both rank and file, to aid me in my effort to organize my regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Men, money, sympathy, influence I &mdash; it seemed <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> as if all the wealth, all the precious life-blood, all that nearly a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> of social and intellectual development had garnered, were offered for the sacrifice.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>At all events, it must have brought sensibly to his mind that he could call with confidence upon the citizens of the free States to fall in and march to the front.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It is to be remembered, however, that the <orgName type="regiment" key="2MARegiment">Second Massachusetts Regiment</orgName> was tendered to the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the letter of <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0177.0004.00009.00137" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>, written on the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">seventeenth</day></dateStruct>, and again by messengers sent direct to the <rs>President</rs>, repeating this offer, on the <dateStruct value="-04-25"><day reg="25">twenty-fifth</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>This complimentary attention from the captain to the corporal was, as I understood the captain, that he might remove any unpleasant impression rankling in the corporal's breast, because of his insisting upon the performance of some particular duty by the corporal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Fortunately for the regiment, but otherwise for the captain, the colonel (passing at the time) witnessed this fraternal drink, and overheard the social pledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>There was no longer the excitement of a campaign, insuring a return to our homes with the green laurels of the victor purchased at an easy price, but there was to be moulded the slow and sure conviction that the war had just begun; that home was in the distant and uncertain future; that the way now entered upon was to be trodden with a spirit and a purpose, in the upholding of which the head was much oftener to be called into counsel than the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>In short, on these <placeName reg="Maryland Heights, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2495447">Maryland Heights</placeName> it was found that the gay sport of an hour had been turned into the grim duty of a life, to be performed with all the resolve of the mind, with all the purposes of the heart, and with a sacrifice of those cherished hopes which too many indulged in when we marched gayly for the seat of war,--hopes expressed to me by <num value="1">one</num> good woman, who said, looking into my face as the full companies of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> were marching out of <placeName reg="Camp Andrew">Camp Andrew</placeName> on our last morning there, <quote>We look to you, <persName n="Gordon,Colonel,,,," id="n0177.0005.00031.00240" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,George,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>, that you return again in safety all these young men to their homes.</quote></p>

<p>In the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="-08-30"><day reg="30">thirtieth</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> our regiment, at the end of its day's march, turned from the road-side into a field within the town of <placeName reg="Darnstown">Darnstown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The single farm-house in view, with the grounds adjacent, called <placeName reg="Pleasant Hill, Cass, Missouri" key="tgn,2060118">Pleasant Hill</placeName>, comprised all we could discover of the village; for the clouds hung densely around us, and the earth and sky were moist with rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>We were cold, hungry, and tired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>In my official capacity I ate a supper prepared for another: doubtless my rank saved me from a blessingafter the meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>That we were to move forward on the morrow I believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>I did not know where; but somewhere, in some position, to take our part in a general attack upon the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>The morning came and went, and we moved not. A week passed; then a month; and but few days were left of another, and still my tent covered the same spot on which it was pitched upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of our arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>For nearly <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, upon the hills, in the valleys, and along the highways of <placeName reg="Darnstown">Darnstown</placeName> were clustered the camps of our division, with their camp-fires at night dotting the ground with flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>For almost <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> we heard at evening music from various regimental bands, as it fell faintly from the distance, or swelled in harmony around, until the drum and fife, or the bugle-call, breaking forth into the tattoo, announced the hour for sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>From day to day, and from night to night, sound and sight repeated itself, until it was not easy, in the strife of the spirit with the tedious details of the hour, to hold in view the grandeur of the achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Even our sentinels, watching the <rs>Potomac</rs>, <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> away from our encampment, softened their hostile glances, and swimming across the river, exchanged friendly conferences and hearty handshakes with their Rebel neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>That the round of duties became tedious must be admitted: provision returns for pork, beans, flour, rice, tea, coffee, etc., were presented <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> with unfailing regularity; there was no break in morning reports of present and absent, of approvals and disapprovals, of attending reveilles, drills, and parades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>It was at this camp that our drills began to receive almost unmerited attention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The confusion into which our battalion seemed to be plunged during these simple movements on that bit of ground called forth great praise when we were extricated and in line again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Who will forget that double column, closed in mass, the countermarch and deploy, the changes of front forward and to the rear, all at double quick, as, with a snap, lines of battle were formed forward, to the rear, to the right, and the left; and who will say that the continually increasing happiness of our men, their contentment, a <num value="1000">thousand</num>-fold greater than when on <placeName reg="Maryland Heights, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2495447">Maryland Heights</placeName>, was not due to the constant praise bestowed upon them for their marked drill and discipline?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>When and why is worth narrating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Our camps overlooked each other, and were separated by a shallow gully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>For a few moments the aspect was threatening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Our guard was promptly turned out under arms; the officers and soldiers of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> calmly awaited the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>There was but a single exception,--a frisky <name>Irishman</name>, probably belonging to <orgName type="company" n="Company I">Company I</orgName>, leaped once or twice in the air, howling with sympathy; he was promptly knocked down by an officer, and suppressed in the guard-tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>At length expostulations prevailed where orders were useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>The officers of the <num value="12" type="ordinal">Twelfth</num> urged their men to desist, and during the remainder of the hour they were quiet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>A rush within our lines was possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Seeing a ruse, suppose they should refuse to go to drill?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>It was very much like a mutiny in the division, and it was quite time for the <rs>General</rs> commanding to interfere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>I laid the matter before him, in time for action before the next day's punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>It was quite evident, I insisted, that <persName n="Webster,Colonel,,,," id="n0177.0005.00051.00301" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Fletcher,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> could not control his men; and it was equally clear these men must be controlled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>The punishment I was inflicting was by sentence of a court; was not cruel.

<p>It was necessary there should be regular soldiers, and it was indispensable, both to their efficiency and to the security of every other class, that they should be kept under a strict discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>An ill-disciplined army has ever been a more costly and a more licentious militia, impotent against a foreign enemy, and formidable only to the country which it is paid to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>A strong line of demarcation, therefore, must be drawn between the soldiers and the rest of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>For the sake of public freedom they must, in the midst of freedom, be placed under a despotic rule; they must be subject to a sharper penal code and to a more stringent code of procedure than are administered by the ordinary tribunals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Some acts which in the citizen are innocent, must in the soldier be crimes; some acts which in the citizen are punished with fine or imprisonment, must in the soldier be punished with death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>The machinery by which courts of law ascertain the guilt or innocence of an accused citizen is too slow and too intricate to be applied to an accused soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>For of all the maladies incident to the body politic, military insubordination is that which requires the most prompt and drastic remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>If the evil be not stopped as soon as it appears, it is certain to spread; and it cannot spread far without danger to the very vitals of the commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>I now resume this history, to speak <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the portentous orders of those days,--stampedes we called them,when we moved but to halt again upon the land of some unfortunate farmer, to trample down his fields, burn his fences, eat his harvests, pluck and roast his growing corn, decapitate his geese, drink his milk, eat his butter and eggs, and occupy his house and barns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>Such cases were grave attacks of stampedes, but generally they were of a milder type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>When the advancing season brought cold nights after hot days, when the murky atmosphere of fall rested upon the hills, and the soft <rs>Indian</rs> summer began to lay hold of the landscape, there fell upon us storms, in which the strong winds swayed our tents, struggling with the flimsy fastenings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>Can we ever forget the crashing of the thunder, the glare of the lightning, and the moaning of the tempest, as the big drops pelted our frail covering, and the clouds <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> brooded over us with a deeper than <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> darkness,this war of Nature, with a whole army enfolded in the arms of sleep, patriot and rebel, on each side of the dividing Potomac, while the sentinels of both armies cowered beneath the storm?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>It was easy in those days to arouse that spirit of obedience to the will of the <rs>Lord</rs>, which, rather than adventure, leads men to deeds of noble daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>It was easier to move the cold nature of our <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> men by exhortation than by allurement; they were rather Puritans than Cavaliers: and what Puritans can do when their blood is thoroughly up has been proved on many fields of battle.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>On all these memories I but touch, that I may recall to mind that the citizens of <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName> were quite willing if not anxious to appeal to the officers for protection against the swarms of foragers who invaded their spring-houses and their cellars for food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>While the men were crawling up towards the bank, pushing their guns before them, and eagerly peering ahead for a shot, I could see with my glass the <rs>Rebel</rs> hunters dodging low along the walls, or creeping carefully behind the bushes, to gain a sheltered spot in an unlookedfor cover, when muskets cracked and a lively rattle mingled with answering growls of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>The creek that separated us from the enemy was not more than <measure n="10yards" type="distance">ten yards</measure> in width.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>On its banks on either side were houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>Back from the river about <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of a mile there was a thick wood, in which the enemy concealed his batteries until he chose to stir us up, when he would sneak up behind the cover, open upon us at an unexpected moment, and retreat rapidly when we replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>The fire from the artillery and the skirmishing between the pickets, though continuous, was wonderfully free from casualties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of our <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> afternoons at this spot, I had just arisen from the rough camp-table that served us for our meals, when hissing and crashing came the enemy's shells over towards our battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>Instantly I heard the cheerful boom of ours in reply; and then, as the enemy's demonstration was a little more spiteful than usual, I got the brigade under arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>There was no harm done; but it took at least a dozen shots from our guns to make the <rs>Rebels</rs> move off.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>The brigade, after some little delay, went into camp again; and the occasion, though <num value="1">one</num> of no moment to the troops, proved a trial to my aid, who having just procured a horse out of the government train, Iust needs try his martial ardor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>The horse was a good-natured, stupid, slow old beast, and mated with another was very well; but, alone, he turned out <quote>a bad lot.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>He did not mind spurs, ran into every man he met, causing much profanity, and was especially obdurate when my aid (an officer of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA2">Second Massachusetts</orgName>) particularly desired to appear in the rl6e of an equestrian warrior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>So here, <num value="1">one</num> regiment having been formed, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA2">Second Massachusetts</orgName> coming up, before which of all others the officer felt a pardonable pride in appearing in most gallant style, his plebeian charger could not be entreated out of a walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>Now any horseman knows that for a military chieftain a gallop is the thing,--a light, airy, arched-neck gallop, a spirited intimation of reserved force, with champing bit and nostrils dilated, and eye flashing, and ear pointed, as reminders of what you may get if you want it. It was something like this that my aid essayed, when, lo!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>his beast struck a dead, lazy, creeping walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>Spurs were dug into him by exasperated heels, until the beast struck a trot that any sixmule team might have envied, jolting the aid a foot from his saddle at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>This was the only response, and it caused derisive laughter from concealed lookers-on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>The <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> continued bumping, and the consciousness of being a merited object of mirth, naturally increased this officer's ire; and it was vented in renewed digging of spurs, until the animal, in sheer desperation at being held in tightly ahead and sharply urged astern, bumped into the drummajor of our regiment and nearly knocked him down, at which the smile was louder than allowed by the regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/><quote>He does n't mind shells, either, half as much as I do,</quote> said the perturbed aid, as he eyed the sorry beast askance while he dwelt upon his vices; <quote>in fact,</quote> he added, <quote>I should like to see the <name>Devil</name> himself make him shy. When those shells were coming over at <placeName reg="Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2115141">Woodstock</placeName>, making a perfectly infernal noise, and other horses were on the rampage, there stood this beast as quiet as if in a stable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>Even when I saw a shell fired, and tried the protection of a friendly tree, he wouldn't stir a peg faster than usual; and the shell burst long before I got him there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>The contrast between my aid's horse and mine only served to make more conspicuous the shortcomings of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>My horse would take a <num value="6">six</num>-rail fence beautifully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>at which my aid's big farm plough-horse would come up, run square into the fence, bump his knees, sneeze, turn around, and stand, firmly courting death rather than attempt the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>Down came the <rs>Captain</rs> with pace growing slower and slower, until he <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> reached the fence; when the horse halted, gravely counted the rails, quietly raised himself on end, put his fore-feet over, gave himself an unearthly hitch with his hind legs, and landed on the other side with a pair of barked shins, then sneezed again, as if he fancied he was a gay courser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>The effect of this school of jumping is hard on the rider, who generally performs unheard &mdash; of gymnastics in the air, and comes down on the pommel of his saddle, to the great detriment of his pantaloons,--though there is some fun in it, and more excitement.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>Though it was a still night, I found from the way in which the air was rushing past my face that my horse must be going at great speed; and this impression was strengthened by hearing behind me the rapid gallop of a horse attempting in vain to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>then sounds of urging to greater speed, until my pursuer was on a run.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>He <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> approached the fence or bar slowly, and preferred to do so at a walk; then slowly rising on his hind legs threw over his fore-feet, following with the rest of his body with a muscular energy that would unseat a careless rider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>Then his neck arched, his immense nostril dilated, his teeth impatiently champed the heavy cavalry bit; every nerve was strung for instant and intense action.
