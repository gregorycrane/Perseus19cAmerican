<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In these later years it has been rather facetiously remarked that in the case of railroads, ground is broken with much ceremony, and that afterward the stockholders are <hi rend="italics">broken without</hi> ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>So in the case of the canal, <persName n="Baldwin,Colonel,,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Baldwin,Loammi,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> removed (at <placeName>Billerica</placeName>) the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> turf, when the work of excavation actually commenced nearly <measure n="16months" type="date">sixteen months</measure> after the granting of the charter, the intervening time <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> having been occupied in acquiring title to the land and surveying in the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Here, in the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century, a mill was erected and thither came the colonists with their corn to be ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Later woolen mills were established, but the ancient terms of the grant required the maintenance of the grist mill; which requirement the canal company carried out, strengthening and making tighter the dam in <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct>, and <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> later, building the present stone dam. This still holds the flood of water, and supplies power to the great factories of the <rs>Talbot</rs> and the <name>Faulkner</name> companies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><hi rend="italics">Over</hi> all the other streams the canal had to be carried and due regard paid to their changeful moods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>A brook that in summer is insignificant, in spring may assume threatening proportions, or carry destruction in its track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Some were but slightly lower; while the <rs>Shawsheen</rs> was spanned by a wooden aqueduct <num value="130">one hundred and thirty</num>seven feet long, elevated <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> above its current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>While the aqueducts were costly, yet the long stretches <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> of meadow land the canal had to cross were extremely treacherous and swallowed up a vast amount of filling ere the course of the canal was secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In some intervals they had to be filled upwards of <measure n="100feet" type="distance">one hundred feet</measure> in width to a depth of <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> to form the canal bed before the embankments were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This difficulty overcome and <placeName reg="Maple Meadow Brook, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1135289">Maple Meadow Brook</placeName> (the source of <placeName reg="Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1124945">Ipswich River</placeName>) crossed, a loop, called the Ox-bow, had to be made around a hill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Much of the work was through a sandy soil, but in various places its course could not avoid ledges of solid rock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>These taxed the effort and patience of the laborers, who were mostly native born, as emigration from <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and <placeName reg="Magyarorszag" key="tgn,7006278">Hungary</placeName> was then but slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But for this, the remaining distance would have been covered by the pond and <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Mystic</placeName>, or, as then called, <placeName reg="Medford River">Medford River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Whether the shallowness of the upper river, or its serpentine course caused the continuation of the artificial channel is unknown.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Briefly described, the canal was a ditch <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> wide and <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> deep below its banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Sometimes these were below the natural surface of the ground, but in many places, artificial embankments were required to preserve the various levels, of which there were <num value="8">eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Between these latter, which varied from <num value="1">one</num> to <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> in length, <num value="16">sixteen</num> locks, like huge steps, were built, overcoming a rise of <measure n="104feet" type="distance">one hundred and four feet</measure> from tide water at <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, to the <rs>Concord</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2049421" n="1.000 11" reg="billerica, middlesex county, massachusetts">Billerica</placeName>, and a descent of <placeName><distance reg="26feet">twenty-six feet</distance> to the <rs>Merrimack</rs></placeName> at <placeName key="tgn,2234243" n="1.000 15" reg="chelmsford, middlesex county, massachusetts">Chelmsford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Filling this ditch to within a foot of the embankment <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> which made the tow path, the fresh waters of the <rs>Concord</rs> floated the numerous boats, laden with merchandise from the north country for over <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>; and at the southern terminus mingled with the salt tides of old ocean, <measure n="27miles" type="distance">twenty-seven miles</measure> from its entrance into the <rs>Merrimack</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The charter gave the directors power to lay assessments upon the stockholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This from time to time, as the work progressed, was done, until over <num value="0.5">a half</num> <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure> were expended in its construction, which in the spring of <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct> was so far advanced as to allow the admission of water as far as <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, once known as the <q direct="unspecified">Land of Nod,</q> and on the <dateStruct value="-07-5"><day reg="5">fifth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> (Independence Day fell on Sunday that year), still further, to <placeName key="tgn,2051000" n="1.000 43" reg="woburn, middlesex county, massachusetts">Woburn</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>These latter were necessitated by the numerous locks, and by the suspension of travel, when the shades of night settled upon the placid waters of the canal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Generally the lock tender was the tavern keeper, who, in the interval between the passage of boats, found time to cultivate a garden and care for his domestic animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>At supper time they must remain, unless the moonlight might serve to reach the next tavern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>None other than the lock tender could pass the boats through, under penalty of <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure>, and a system of <q direct="unspecified">passports,</q> or way bills, that had to be endorsed at every lock, served to keep the tenders at their places, and prevent <q direct="unspecified">imposition on the part of the boatmen.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/></p> 
<p>Among the incidental expenses of the canal was the <q direct="unspecified">bounty</q> (about <measure n="2s." type="currency"><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> each) paid for the killing of <q direct="unspecified">musk ratts.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Evidently the boys of those days profited thereby, as they could retain the skins of the <q direct="unspecified">ratts.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>While the demands of the <q direct="unspecified">men</q> were satisfied with this modest amount for <q direct="unspecified">rum</q> on special occasion, the <q direct="unspecified">directors' party</q> of the same year had a supply of <measure n="27dollars" type="currency">$27</measure> worth of <q direct="unspecified">wine, lemons and sugar.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The bill also had an extra charge for broken tumblers, but had a contra credit of over <measure n="14dollars" type="currency">$14</measure> for wine not used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>From this we may infer that the <q direct="unspecified">junket</q> is not an altogether modern affair; but it is doubtful if the expense of those of the present is nearly as light, or if any material items of credit appear on the bills.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The wages paid the boatmen and laborers varied somewhat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>For instance, <num value="1">one</num> who <q direct="unspecified">found</q> himself, received <measure n="1.50dollars" type="currency">$1.50</measure> per day, but deducted from his bill a shilling each for meals had at the taverns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>My Dear daughter <persName><foreName>Emma</foreName></persName>:&mdash;I'm going to write you as near as I can the particulars of the expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7014076" n="1.000 108" reg="goldsboro, wayne, north carolina">Goldsboro</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>We started on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, <dateStruct value="-12-11"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="11">11</day></dateStruct> (along the <placeName key="tgn,1131021" n="1.000 4" reg="trent, north carolina, united states">Trent</placeName> road), about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time>, and marched over to our parade ground and stood there until <time value="12pm">noon</time> in a most intense fog. It was so thick that we could n't see a man to tell who he was <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> from us, till <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time>, so we could n't see the other troops pass off. It was said that there were about <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> in our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>We had the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> post of honor of the whole army, on the extreme left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>But I don't think much of that post of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>The army was about <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> long, and we in the rear of them&mdash;baggage wagons and all. We acted as <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> until we got to the place called <placeName reg="Seven Springs, Wayne, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076578">Whitehall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Then we passed the whole and it brought us in front at the battle of <placeName reg="Everett's Mills">Everett's Mills</placeName>, near <placeName key="tgn,7014076" n="1.000 108" reg="goldsboro, wayne, north carolina">Goldsboro</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>There we saw the sights and saw the rebels cut down like grass before the scythe, by the artillery which we were supporting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>But we had no opportunity to fire at them, and the artillery did the work at a distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>We marched the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day about <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> and did not arrive in camp until <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>We marched through mud and water, and the teams would get stuck, and we had to stay behind, and could not advance at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>We finally went into a cornfield to sleep a few hours, but I did not like the accommodations, so <persName n="Page,Corporal,,,," id="n0334.0008.00088.00941" reg="mostcommon:Page,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Page</surname></persName> of the <name>Danvers</name> company and I went in search of something better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>We found a corn barn near by and went in and laid down, but before we got to sleep we had some company from ours and other companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>But their noise did not disturb us much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>You may wonder why I took a corporal from another company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>I went <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> as a <orgName n="Color Guard" type="guard">color guard</orgName> this time, as <persName n="Newhall,,Everett,,," id="n0334.0008.00089.00942" reg="default:Newhall,Everett,,,"><foreName>Everett</foreName> <surname>Newhall</surname></persName> was sick, and I was detailed for that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>I did the best I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>It proved to be the easiest berth in the company, as I had no other duties to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>My duty was to take care of the colors, or rather, my part of it. I did not leave them from the time we started till we returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/><dateStruct value="-12-12"><day type="name">Friday</day>, <month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="12">12</day></dateStruct>, we took up a march at <time value="7:30">half-past 7</time>, and marched until <num value="10">ten</num> at night, then went into another cornfield, and rather low ground I thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>There was a house near by and a lot of board fences, which the boys stripped very soon, I assure you. The colonel stopped all the boys from going into the buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>I told <persName n="Page,Corporal,,,," id="n0334.0008.00089.00943" reg="mostcommon:Page,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Page</surname></persName> to hold on a minute till the colonel had gone into the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>As soon as he went we started and went into a cook house, and there we found <num value="2">two</num> bedsteads, and both had beds on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>We got in just before the guard was put on. After we got into the house <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> men came in.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>In a few moments in came an officer and drove them all out, as he thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>I whispered to Page to keep still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>All the rest of them went out, but we went to bed. In about <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> in came <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> officers, and we were snug in bed, and there we stayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>They built up a great fire and we slept as comfortably as we should at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>I told him all it wanted was a little cheek, and that is what everyone must have in order to live on such expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>I think we marched about <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure> that day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>In the course of the day the teams got stuck, and it made it very slow marching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>They had to unload some of their stores and gave them out to the men, and such scrabbling you never saw!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>You would think it was gold dust, or that they were starved to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>As I lodged in the house, I did n't get any. I got some bread, as there was not so much of a rush around the bread as around the sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>It was quite a sight to see men fight for a cupful of sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>But <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> I <hi rend="italics">had</hi> some of the sugar, for <persName n="Page,Corporal,,,," id="n0334.0008.00090.00944" reg="mostcommon:Page,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Page</surname></persName> stepped ahead and got nearly a quart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>We chummed together during the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>What he had I had. He had some <q direct="unspecified">cheek,</q> as well as myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>Foraging was forbidden except when detailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>I think there were not many places but what were pretty well ransacked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>The cavalry and artillery took all the horses and mules with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>We went into camp about <num value="10">ten</num>, in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>Weather quite warm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>We scraped up some leaves and made up a bed, and slept <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rate.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Our regiment was detailed to go on picket duty by companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>There was a church there, and the colonel took it for headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>So the colors had to stay there with him, and we had a day of rest in the <q direct="unspecified">church,</q> as it was called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>It was about <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> long by <num value="30">thirty</num> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>There was no finish about it. The pulpit was nearly in the centre, and a partition across it. Back of the pulpit was for the colored people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>They had a stand-up seat in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>There were some seats, or benches, just as you choose to call them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>It was never painted outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>It had <num value="3">three</num> doors for the white people and <num value="1">one</num> for the colored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>It stood in a bend of the road in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>The place was called <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, so a prisoner told me whom we had there all day. I think he had not been to church for some time, although he was taken about a mile from there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>He said he owned a farm and <num value="2">two</num> slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>I asked him what denomination worshipped there, and he said he believed it was <q direct="unspecified">Missionary.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>He did n't pretend to know much, but I think he knew more than he cared to have known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>We kept him until we got to our journey's end, and then let him go. During the day we had a battle at <placeName reg="Kingston, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049971">Kingston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>There were quite a number killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>As near as I can find out there were <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> <measure n="40" type="killed">forty killed</measure> and <measure n="150" type="wounded">one hundred and fifty wounded</measure>. I saw some dead and wounded when we passed the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>Our army took the place and burnt the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>We privates in the ranks can't tell much about it. There are a <num value="1000">thousand</num> stories afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>I suppose you will get the particulars before I do.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>The prisoner stayed in the church all day, but when night came, he was put out of doors to sleep under guard, on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>There were none of our regiment in that battle, although <num value="2">two</num> companies were ordered into <placeName reg="Kingston, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049971">Kingston</placeName> <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, to do guard duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>I understand that some of our soldiers found some things of value in <placeName reg="Kingston, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049971">Kingston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/><num value="1">One</num> man found <num value="100">one hundred</num> silver dollars, others, watches and silverware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>We marched until <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, then camped in a cornfield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>When we got up the ground was frozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>Not much of any account happened that day. <date>Tuesday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="16">sixteenth</day></dateStruct>, we marched toward <placeName reg="Seven Springs, Wayne, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076578">Whitehall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>Very soon we heard the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>We kept on until we nearly reached the battlefield, and then had orders to halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>We saw the ambulance teams with the wounded while stopping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>We halted about <num value="0.5">one-half</num> hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>A good many were wounded there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>The rebs were in the woods so we could not see them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>It was said that we did n't see a man, but the bullets flew thick and fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Our army kept up a brisk fire for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure>, and we were too much for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>The rebs were up in trees as sharp-shooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Finally the infantry was ordered into the woods to drive them out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/><num value="2">Two</num> of our regiment were wounded while passing up the road, and I had <num value="1">one</num> ball pass directly over me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>The ground was frozen, so Page and I went off to see if we could find a shelter, but could not. I found some boards and brought them to the field, and we laid our blankets on them and went to sleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> we took up our march through a thick wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>At <time value="12pm">noon</time> an officer came back and said there were <num value="3">three</num> regiments of rebels in a field ahead of us. The cavalry and artillery went ahead and we were ordered to close up in our places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>The batteries were placed in position, and as the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> was on the left, it brought us into the woods, when we formed in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Our brigade burnt the railroad bridge and tore up about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> of track, burnt the sleepers, and spoilt the rails.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>Then all was quiet for awhile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Then we were ordered to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Being at the left we were behind, except the batteries and cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>All at once we heard cheering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>All but the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 5">fifth</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">third regiments</orgName> had crossed a small brook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>It rather astonished us all. All the batteries had gone except <num value="2">two</num> pieces.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>I stepped out of the ranks near the batteries and just then discovered a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Said I, <q direct="unspecified">That's none of our folks, there's a secesh flag.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>The captain of the battery looked and said, <q direct="unspecified">Yes, give them some, boys.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>Then our brigade was ordered back to support the <num value="2">two</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>The captain of the battery asked <q direct="unspecified">What regiment is this?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/><num value="100">One hundred</num> voices cried out <q direct="unspecified"><orgName type="regiment" key="MA5">Fifth Massachusetts</orgName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>He said <q direct="unspecified">Good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>You can support us.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">third regiment</orgName> was behind us on our right, and some other regiment was on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>They fired the battery twice and the shot went over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>Then the captain said, <q direct="unspecified">Let me range that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>Put in a double head of <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> canister.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>He did, and I should think he mowed down a <num value="100">hundred</num> or more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>It cut the flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>He ranged it again with as good success as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>He said, <q direct="unspecified">That's the way to give them some,</q> and you never saw a flock of sheep scatter mote than they did. About that time a battery opened upon us. The colonel ordered us to lie down, then <num value="1">one</num> of our batteries opened fire and they exchanged a number of shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>I recollected what <persName n="Lawrence,General,,,," id="n0334.0008.00093.00950" reg="mostcommon:Lawrence,Rosewell,B.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lawrence</surname></persName> told me. He said when I heard a shot coming to lie close to the ground, and I did so, but as soon as it passed, my head was up. Being near the centre of the regiment I could see, and we could hear them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>The batteries over the other side of the brook kept up a rapid firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>The <num value="2">two</num> guns in front of us fired every cartridge they had. <hi rend="italics">We</hi> did not fire a gun. The <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">third regiment</orgName> fired, but what at I could not see. The rebels retreated and burned a bridge to stop our following them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>They were from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, the <hi rend="italics">fighting</hi> men you know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>They meant to play a shrewd game on us. They came out on our right to attract our attention, while others planned to go round and surround us, as all the troops had gone but our brigade, but they missed it. They opened a dam and raised the water in the brook some <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> before we got over it. We stayed there about an hour and waded up to our waists through the brook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>The water rose <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> in half an hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>We halted as soon as we got over for the other regiment to form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> went down to the brook, and it was <num value="4">four</num> times as wide as when we crossed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>There were between <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="4000">four thousand</num> rebels in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>I did not consider myself in any danger till the batteries opened fire upon us upon the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>After we got straightened out again, we marched back about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> and went into camp in a cornfield about midnight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>We made fires and dried our clothes and then went to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/><date>Thursday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">eighteenth</day></dateStruct>, we again came in the rear of the army and did not get into camp till <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>It was dark, and when we went into camp there were but <num value="9">nine</num> men. <num value="1">One</num> of the color bearers gave out, so <persName n="Page,Corporal,,,," id="n0334.0008.00094.00951" reg="mostcommon:Page,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Page</surname></persName> took the colors, and as he had his gun, I took <num value="1">one</num> end of the staff and he the other, and in we went, with <num value="1">one</num> sergeant and <num value="2">two</num> corporals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>As we were going in, some officers wanted to know where the head of the regiment was. The major told them he did n't know, but here were the colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>I believe no company came in with more than <num value="12">twelve</num> men. Page and I made a fire and laid down to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>It was then <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>. On a rise of ground just before we got to camp, we saw the camp fires of about <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men. It was as splendid a sight as ever I saw.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/><date>Friday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">nineteenth</day></dateStruct>, we took up our march and passed <placeName reg="Kingston, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049971">Kingston</placeName> on our left, across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>We passed a house used as a hospital, and there were rebels who were wounded there, and a rebel surgeon was with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/><date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="20">twentieth</day></dateStruct>, we marched within <placeName><distance reg="14miles">fourteen miles</distance> of <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName></placeName>, and went into camp in a thick wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>There I scraped up some leaves and made a good bed, as I thought; but I took cold for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time on our whole route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>In the morning the ground was frozen hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>On <date>Sunday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">twenty-first</day></dateStruct>, we marched at <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time> home to <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>We arrived there about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="30">thirty</num>, and the boys were glad to get home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>We had coffee enough and we had to make it in our dippers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>We had no meat, only what we foraged, and that was very little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>I marched <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> with only <num value="3">three</num> hard tack a day and coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>The last day I marched into <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName> with only <num value="1">one</num> cracker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>The last <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> it should not have been so, for the gunboats met us at <placeName reg="Kingstown, Cleveland, North Carolina" key="tgn,2438682">Kingston</placeName>, and they might have brought us enough to eat. But we lived and came in almost as good as new. I don't think there was a man in the regiment who came in better than I did. I feel now as <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> if I could start again and go on another, if they gave me enough to eat. During the march we made a good many halts, and we would set the fences on fire and make coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>In fact you might say we burnt all the fences on our line of march, and when we camped we took all the fences we could find for camp fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>When we got into the woods we set pitch pine trees afire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>They would burn like so much pitch, and the fire would stream clear up to the top, making the most splendid sight you ever saw, especially in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>The whole woods were afire from within <placeName><distance reg="15miles">fifteen miles</distance> of <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName></placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7014076" n="1.000 108" reg="goldsboro, wayne, north carolina">Goldsboro</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>Sometimes we would come out into a plain, and perhaps there would be a tree, <measure n="100feet" type="distance">one hundred feet</measure> high, all burnt, so that nothing but the bare ends of the limbs would be on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>I never saw any fireworks on Boston Common so elegant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>But now you can guess how we looked after marching through all this smoke and pitch pine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>Our clothes were smutty as well as our faces, and we looked as if we had been in a smokehouse.
