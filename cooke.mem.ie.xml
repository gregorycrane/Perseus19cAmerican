<head>Introduction.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>These <quote>Personal portraits</quote> were undertaken with the design of making better known and understood the great actors in the recent struggle who are the subjects of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>It is a matter of grave importance that the illustrious figures of the war should not be obscured by the mists of ignorance or falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Nor can they be. Dulness and slander do not long blind the eyes of men; and sooner or later the light of truth makes all things visible in their natural colours and proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>To the good work of placing upon record the actual truth in relation to the lives and characters of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00003.00001" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and some other noble soldiers of the <rs>Southern</rs> army, the writer of this page has here brought a few of his recollections-aiming to draw these <quote>worthies</quote> rather as they lived and moved, following their various idiosyncrasies, than as they performed their <quote>official</quote> duties on the public stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>This seemed best calculated to display their real individuality &mdash; the embodiment of their personal characteristics in a portrait with the pen, as a painter draws the form and features of his sitter with the brush. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Such personal details of the characters of these eminent men will not be uninteresting to the lovers of noble natures of whatever <quote>faction;</quote> nor is the fondness for such particulars either trivial or ignoble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>They elucidate biography and history-which are the same &mdash; for they present the likeness of the actor in the <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> drama, his character and endowments; and to know what great men <hi rend="italics">are</hi>, is better than to know what they <hi rend="italics">perform</hi>. What <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00004.00002" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00004.00003" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00004.00004" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00004.00005" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, and their associates accomplished, history will record; how they looked, and moved, and spoke, will attract much less attention from the <quote>historian of the future.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The august muse of history will make her partial and passionate, or fair and dignified, summary of the events of the late war; will discuss the <hi rend="italics">causas resum</hi> with learned philosophy; and mete out in rounded periods what she thinks the due amount of glory or shame to the actors, in gray or in blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>But meanwhile the real personages disappear, and the colours fade; figures become historical personages, not men. And events, too, <quote>suffer change.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>They are fused in the mass; generalization replaces the particular incident as it does the impressive trait;--the terrible dust of <quote>official documents</quote> obscures personages, characters, and events. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This is trite, but it is true; and the fact thus lamely stated is <num value="1">one</num> of the <quote>chiefest spites of fate.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>For what is the picture worth unless drawn in its actual colours?-what the value of the figures unless they are likenesses?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The war just ended was not an <quote>official transaction,</quote> only to be calmly narrated with dignified generalization, philosophic reasoning, and commonplace comment upon peace conferences, grand tactics, and the political bearing of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It was a mighty drama, all life, passion, movement, incident, and romance &mdash; a singular melange, wherein tears, laughter, sighs and smiles, rapidly followed each other, communicating to the bitter and determined struggle all the profound interest of a tragedy whose scenes sweep on before the spectator to the catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Nor were the actors in the tragedy blocks of wood, or merely <quote>official personages</quote> playing coldly their stage parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They were men of flesh and blood, full of high resolve, vehement passion; subject to hope, fear, rejoicing, depression; but faithful through all to the great principles which drove them on-principles in which they believed, and for which they were ready to die. They were noble types of the great <persName n="Norman,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00004.00006" reg="mostcommon:Norman,nomatch:0"><surname>Norman</surname></persName> race of which the <rs>Southern</rs> people come-brave, honourable, courteous, social; quick in resentment, proud, but placable; and these <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> conspicuous traits were everywhere seen in their actions and daily lives. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The portraits here presented of a few of these men may be rude and incomplete, but they are likenesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>No personage is spoken of with whom the writer was not more or less acquainted; and every trait and incident set down was either observed by himself or obtained from good authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Invention has absolutely nothing to do with the sketches; the writer has recorded his recollections, and not his fancies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The <quote>picturesque</quote> is a poor style of art, when truth is sacrificed to it. To represent <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0001.00005.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> decked out in a splendid uniform bedizzened with gold lace, on a <quote>prancing steed,</quote> and followed by a numerous and glittering staff, might <quote>tickle the ears of the groundlings;</quote> but the picture would be apt to <quote>make the judicious grieve.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The latter class would much prefer the actual man, in his old gray cape and plain brown coat, riding, unattended, on his sober iron-gray along the lines; would rather hear him say amid the storm of <placeName key="tgn,7014060;tgn,2348269" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7014060;gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania,Adams,Pennsylvania,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2348269;gettysburg, kershaw, south carolina,Kershaw,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania,Adams,Pennsylvania,United States,North and Central America;gettysburg, kershaw, south carolina,Kershaw,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America">Gettysburg</placeName>, in his calm brave voice, <quote>Never mind; it is not your fault, General; I am to blame,</quote> than read the most eloquent sentences which the imagination could invent for him. And in regard to others, the truth would possess an equal superiority over fiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00005.00008" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was a noble human soul; pure, generous, fearless, of imperial genius for making war; but why claim for him personal graces, and the charm of social humour?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00005.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> ranked justly with the <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> greatest cavalry commanders of the world, and in his character combined gaiety, courage, resolution, winning manners, and the purest traits of the gentleman and <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00005.00010" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>; but why draw the gallant cavalier as utterly faultless, never moved by anger, ever serious and devout as was <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0001.00005.00011" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>By such a process the actual characters disappear; the real men, with faults and virtues, grand traits and foibles, become mere lay-figures to hang uniforms upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The pictures should either be made likenesses, or not be painted; events should be represented in their real colours, or not at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>These few words will explain the character of the sketches here presented, and the theory upon which the writer has proceeded in drawing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They are conscientious <quote>studies,</quote> and <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> the result of an honest desire to elucidate the characters of their subjects, who are here described in rapid outline as they lived and moved before all eyes upon the stage of the war. Eulogy has not magnified them, as partisan rancour has not blackened their adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They appeared as they are here drawn to the eyes of the writer; if the portraits are unfaithful, it is not because he lacked the fairness, but wanted the ability, to <quote>denote them truly.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00007.00013" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, chief of the <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName> in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, was <num value="1">one</num> of the <foreign lang="la">Dii Majores</foreign> of the recent conflict-his career rather a page from romance than a chapter of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Everything stirring, brilliant, and picturesque, seemed to centre in him. There was about the man a flavour of chivalry and adventure which made him more like a knight of the middle age than a soldier of the prosaic <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century, and it was less the science than the poetry of war which he summed up and illustrated in his character and career. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>With the majority of those who took part in it, the late revolution was a hard and bitter struggle, which they entered upon resolutely, but with unconcealed distaste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>To this soldier, however, it seemed to be a splendid and exciting game, in which his blood coursed joyously, and his immensely strong physical organization found an arena for the display of all its faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The affluent life of the man craved those perils and hardships which flush the pulses and make the heart beat fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>A single look at him was enough to convince anybody that <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00007.00014" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> loved danger and adventure, and that the clear blue eyes of the soldier, <quote>with a frolic welcome took the thunder and the sunshine.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He swung himself into the saddle, at the sound of the bugle, as the hunter springs on horseback; and at such moments his cheeks glowed, and his huge moustache curled with enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> romance and poetry of the hard trade of arms seemed <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be inaugurated when this joyous cavalier, with his floating plume and splendid laughter, appeared upon the great arena of the war in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This gay bearing of the man was plainly unaffected, and few persons could resist its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>There was about <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00008.00015" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> an inspiration of joy and youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The war was evidently like play to him-and he accepted its most perilous scenes and cruellest hardships with the careless abandon of a young knight-errant seeking adventures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Nothing seemed strong enough to break down his powerful organization of mind and body; and danger only aroused and brought his full faculties into play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He greeted it with ardour and defied it with his joyous laughter-leading his column in desperate charges with a smile upon the lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Others might despond, but <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00008.00016" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> kept his good spirits; and while the air around him was full of hissing balls and bursting shell, he would hum his gay songs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> the infantry were electrified by the laughter and singing of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00008.00017" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> as he led them in the charge; and at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, where he commanded <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s corps after that great man's fall, the infantry veterans as they swept on, carrying line after line of breastworks at the point of the bayonet, saw his plume floating in front-<quote>like <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> of Navarre's,</quote> <num value="1">one</num> of them said-and heard his sonorous voice singing, <quote><persName n="Hooker,,Old Joe,,," id="n0011.0002.00008.00018" reg="default:Hooker,Old Joe,,,"><foreName>Old Joe</foreName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, will you come out of the <rs>Wilderness</rs>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/></p> 
<p>This curious spirit of boyish gaiety did not characterize him on certain occasions only, but went with him always, surrounding every movement of the man with a certain atmosphere of frolic and abandon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Immense animal health and strength danced in his eyes, gave elasticity to the motions of his person, and rang in his contagious laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It was hard to realize that anything could hurt this powerful machine, or that death could ever come to him; and the perilous positions from which he had so often escaped unharmed, appeared to justify the idea of his invulnerability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Although he exposed his person recklessly in more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> hot engagements, he was never wounded in any. The rosebud in his button-hole, which some child or girl had <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> given him, or rather say his mother's Bible, which he always carried, seemed to protect him. Death appeared to shrink before him and avoid him; and he laughed in the grim face, and dared it for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of reckless fighting, in which he seemed every day to be trying to get himself killed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>His personal appearance coincided with his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Everything about the man was youthful, picturesque, and brilliant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00019" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00020" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and other eminent soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>, seemed desirous of avoiding, in their dress and accoutrements every species of display, and to aim at making themselves resemble as closely as possible their brave soldiers, whose uniforms were sadly deficient in military gewgaws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00021" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s taste was exactly the opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He was as fond of colours as a boy or a girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>His fighting jacket shone with dazzling buttons and was covered with gold braid; his hat was looped up with a golden star, and decorated with a black ostrich plume; his fine buff gauntlets reached to the elbow; around his waist was tied a splendid yellow silk sash, and his spurs were of pure gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The stern Ironsides of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00022" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> would have sneered at this <quote>frivolous boy</quote> as they sneered at <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Rupert</foreName></persName>, with his scarlet cloak, his waving plume, his white dog, and his <measure n="23years" type="date">twenty-three years</measure>-all the more as <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00023" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> had a white dog for a pet, wore a cape lined with scarlet, had a plume in his hat, and &mdash; to complete the comparison &mdash; is said to have belonged to that royal family of Stuarts from which <persName><foreName>Rupert</foreName></persName> sprang.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Many excellent people did not hesitate to take the <rs>Ironside</rs> view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>They regarded and spoke of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00024" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> as a trifling military fop &mdash; a man who had in some manner obtained a great command for which he was wholly unfit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They sneered at his splendid costume, his careless laughter, his <quote>love of ladies;</quote> at his banjo-player, his flower-wreathed horses, and his gay verses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The enemy were wiser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/><persName n="Buford,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00025" reg="mostcommon:Buford,nomatch:0"><surname>Buford</surname></persName>, <persName n="Bayard,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00026" reg="mostcommon:Bayard,nomatch:0"><surname>Bayard</surname></persName>, <persName n="Pleasanton,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00027" reg="mostcommon:Pleasanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pleasanton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00009.00028" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>, and their associates, did not commit that blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>They had felt the heavy arm too often; and knew too well the weight of that flower-encircled weapon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>There were <num value="3">three</num> other men who could never be persuaded <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> that <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00010.00029" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was no cavalry officer, and who persisted in regarding this boyish cavalier as their right-hand man &mdash; the <quote>eye and ear</quote> of their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>These men were <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00010.00030" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00010.00031" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00010.00032" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Years crammed with incident and adventure cannot be summed up on a page. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He was <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> when he resigned his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-lieutenancy in the <orgName type="mil" key="USCav">United States cavalry</orgName>, and came to offer his sword to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He was sprung from an old and honourable family there, and his love of his native soil was strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Upon his arrival he was made lieutenant-colonel, and placed in command of the cavalry on the <rs>Upper Potomac</rs>, where he proved himself so vigilant a soldier that <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00010.00034" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> called him <quote>the indefatigable <rs>Stuart</rs>,</quote> and compared him to <quote>a yellow jacket,</quote> which was <quote>no sooner brushed off than it lit back.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He had command of the whole front until <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00010.00035" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> left the valley, when he moved with the column to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and charged and broke the <orgName type="mil" key="NYZouaveVolunteer">New York Zouaves</orgName>; afterwards held the front toward <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, under <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00010.00036" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>; then came the hard falling back, the struggle upon the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, the battle of Cold Harbour, and the advance which followed into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>History will paint the latter-my page deals with the former chiefly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It is in dress, habits, the tone of the voice, the demeanour <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> in private, that men's characters are read; and I have never seen a man who looked his character more perfectly than <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00012.00055" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He was the cavalier <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>; and everything which he did, or said, was <quote>in character.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>We know a clergyman sometimes by his moderation, mild address, black coat, and white cravat; a merchant by his quick movements and <quote>business-like</quote> manner; a senator by his gravity; and a poet by his dreamy eye. You saw in the same manner, at a single glance, that <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00012.00056" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was a cavalry-man &mdash; in his dress, voice, walk, manner, everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>All about him was military; and, fine as his costume undoubtedly was, it <quote>looked like work.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>There was no little fondness, as I have said, for bright colours and holiday display in his appearance; and he loved the parade, the floating banner, the ring of the bugle, <quote>ladies' eyes</quote> --all the glory, splendour, and brilliant colouring of life; but the soldier of hard fibre and hard work was under the gallant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Some day a generation will come who will like to know all about the famous <quote><placeName reg="Jeb Stuart">Jeb Stuart</placeName></quote> --let me therefore limn him as he appeared in the years <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>His frame was low and athletic-close knit and of very great strength and endurance, as you could see at a glance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>His countenance was striking and attracted attention &mdash; the forehead broad, lofty, and indicating imagination; the nose prominent, and inclining to <quote><persName n="Roman,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00012.00057" reg="mostcommon:Roman,nomatch:0"><surname>Roman</surname></persName>,</quote> with large and mobile nostrils; the lips covered with a heavy brown moustache, curled upward at the ends; the chin by a huge beard of the same colour, which descended upon the wearer's breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Such was the rather brigandish appearance of Stuart-but I have omitted to notice the eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>They were clear, penetrating, and of a brilliant blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>They could be soft or fiery-would fill with laughter or dart flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Anything more menacing than that flame, when <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00012.00058" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was hard pressed, it would be difficult to conceive; but the prevailing expression was gay and laughing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>He wore a brown felt hat looped up with a star, and ornamented with an ebon feather; a double-breasted jacket always open and buttoned back; gray waistcoat and pantaloons; and boots to the knee, decorated with small spurs, which he wore even in dancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>To proceed with my catalogue of the soldier's accoutrements: on marches he threw over his <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> shoulders his gray cavalry cape, and on the pommel of his saddle was strapped an <rs n="oil cloth" type="product">oil-cloth</rs> overall, used as a protection in rain, which, instead of annoying him, seemed to raise his spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>In the midst of rain-storms, when everybody was riding along grum and cowering beneath the flood pouring down, he would trot on, head up, and singing gaily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>His arms were, a light <name>French</name> sabre, balanced by a pistol in a black holster; his covering at night, a red blanket, strapped in an <rs n="oil cloth" type="product">oil-cloth</rs> behind the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Such was the <quote>outer man</quote> of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00013.00059" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> in camp and field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>His fondness for bright colours, however, sometimes made him don additional decorations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Among these was a beautiful yellow sash, whose folds he would carefully wrap around his waist, skilfully tying the ends on the left side so that the tassels fell full in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Over this he would buckle his belt; his heavy boots would be changed for a pair equally high, but of bright patent leather, decorated with gold thread; and then the gallant <rs>Jeb Stuart</rs> was ready to visit somebody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>This love of gay colours was shown in other ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>He never moved on the field without his splendid red battle-flag; and more than once this prominent object, flaunting in the winds drew the fire of the enemy's artillery on himself and staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Among flowers, he preferred the large dazzling <quote>Giant of battles,</quote> with its blood-red disk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>But he loved all blooms for their brilliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Lent was not his favourite season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Life in his eyes was best when it was all flowers, bright colours, and carnival. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>He was a bold and expert rider, and stopped at nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Frequently the headlong speed with which he rode saved him from death or capture &mdash; as at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, where he darted close along the front of a Federal regiment which rose and fired on him. The speed of his horse was so great that not a ball struck him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He was a <quote>horse-man</quote> in his knowledge of horses, but had no <quote>passion</quote> for them; preferred animals of medium size, which wheeled, leaped, and moved rapidly; and, mounted upon his <quote><persName><foreName>Skylark</foreName></persName>,</quote> <quote>Star of the east,</quote> <quote><persName n="Margaret,Lady,,,," id="n0011.0002.00013.00060" reg="mostcommon:Margaret,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Margaret</surname></persName>,</quote> or <quote>Lily of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>,</quote> he was the picture <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> of a bold cavalier, prepared to go into a charge, or to take a gallop by moonlight-ready for a fight or a frolic. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>It was out of the saddle, however, that <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00014.00061" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was most attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>There he was busy; in his tent, when his work was once over, he was an <hi rend="italics">insouciant</hi> as a boy. Never was there a human being of readier laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>He dearly loved a joke, and would have <num value="1">one</num> upon everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>They were not mild either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>He loved a horse-joke, and a horse-laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>But the edge of his satire, although keen, was never envenomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The uproarious humour of the man took away anything like sarcasm from his wit, and he liked you to <quote>strike back.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>What are called <quote>great people</quote> sometimes break their jests upon lesser personages, with a tacit understanding that the great personage shall not be jested at in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Such deference to his rank was abhorrent to <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00014.00062" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>He jested roughly, but you were welcome to handle him as roughly in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>If you could turn the laugh upon him, you were perfectly welcome so to do, and he never liked you the less for it. In winter-quarters his tent was a large affair, with a good chimney and fireplace; in the summer, on active service, a mere breadth of canvas stretched over rails against a tree, and open at both ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Or he had no tent, and slept under a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The canvas <quote>fly</quote> only came into requisition when he rested for a few days from the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Under this slight shelter, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00014.00063" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was like a king of rangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>On <num value="1">one</num> side was his chair and desk; on the other, his blankets spread on the ground: at his feet his <num value="2">two</num> setters, <quote>Nip</quote> and <quote><persName n="Tuck,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00014.00064" reg="mostcommon:Tuck,nomatch:0"><surname>Tuck</surname></persName>,</quote> whom he had brought out of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, on the saddle, as he fell back before the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>When tired of writing, he would throw himself upon his blankets, play with his pets, laugh at the least provocation, and burst into some gay song. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>He had a strong love for music, and sang, himself, in a clear, sonorous, and correct voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>His favourites were: <quote>The bugle sang truce, for the night cloud had lowered;</quote> <quote>The dew is on the blossom;</quote> <quote>Sweet Evelina,</quote> and <quote><persName n="Evelyn,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00014.00065" reg="mostcommon:Evelyn,nomatch:0"><surname>Evelyn</surname></persName>,</quote> among pathetic songs; but comic ones were equal or greater favourites with him: <quote>If you get there before I do;</quote> <quote>The old gray horse;</quote> <quote>Come out of the wilderness,</quote> and <quote>If you want to have a good <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> time, join the cavalry,</quote> came from his lips in grand uproarious merriment, the very woods ringing with the strains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>This habit of singing had always characterized him. From the days in the valley when he harassed <persName n="Paterson,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00066" reg="mostcommon:Paterson,nomatch:0"><surname>Paterson</surname></persName> so, with his omnipresent cavalry, he had fought and sung alternately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Riding at the head of his long column, bent upon some raid, or advancing to attack the enemy, he would make the forest resound with his sonorous songs; and a gentleman who met him <num value="1">one</num> day, thus singing in front of his men, said that the young cavalier was his perfect ideal of a knight of romance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>It might almost, indeed, be said that music was his passion, as <foreign lang="fr">Vive la joie!</foreign> might have been regarded as his motto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>His banjo-player, <persName n="Sweeny,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00067" reg="mostcommon:Sweeny,nomatch:0"><surname>Sweeny</surname></persName>, was the constant inmate of his tent, rode behind him on the march, and went with him to social gatherings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>On the march, the banjo was frequently put in requisition; and those <quote>grave people</quote> who are shocked by <quote>frivolity</quote> must have had their breath almost taken away by this extraordinary spectacle of the famous <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00070" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, commanding all the cavalry of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00071" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, moving at the head of his hard-fighting corps with a banjo-player rattling behind him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>He fought harder than they did, and chose to amuse himself in his own way. <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00073" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00074" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00075" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, had listened to that banjo without regarding it as frivolous; and more than once it had proved a relaxation after the exhausting cares of command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>So it rattled on still, and <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00076" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> continued to laugh, without caring much about <quote>the serious family</quote> class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>He had on his side <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00077" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00078" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and the young ladies who danced away gaily to <persName n="Sweeny,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00015.00079" reg="mostcommon:Sweeny,nomatch:0"><surname>Sweeny</surname></persName>'s music-what mattered it whether Aminadab Sleek, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, approved or disapproved! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Never have I seen a purer, more knightly, or more charming gallantry than his. He was here, as in all his life, the <rs>Christian</rs> gentleman, the loyal and consistent professor of religion; but <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> with this delicacy of the chevalier was mingled the gaiety of the boy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Ladies were his warmest admirers &mdash; for they saw that under his laughing exterior was an earnest nature and a warm heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Everything drew them towards him. The romance of his hard career, the adventurous character of the man, his mirth, wit, gallantry, enthusiasm, and the unconcealed pleasure which he showed in their society, made him their prime favourite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>They flocked around him, gave him flowers, and declared that if they could they would follow his feather and fight with him. With all this, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00016.00081" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was delighted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>He gave them positions on his staff, placed the flowers in his button-hole, kissed the fair hands that presented them, and if the cheek was near the hand, he would laugh and kiss that too.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>To lie upon his camp-couch and play with <num value="1">one</num> of his children, appeared to be the summit of felicity with him; and when, during the hard falling back near <placeName key="tgn,2114702" n="1.000 27" reg="upperville, fauquier, virginia">Upperville</placeName>, in the fall of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, the news came of the death of his little daughter <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00016.00084" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName>, he seemed almost overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>He seemed rough and hard to those who only saw him now and then; but the persons who lived with him knew his great kindness of heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Under that careless, jesting, and often curt demeanour, was a good, true heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The fibre of the man <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> was tough under all strain, and his whole organization was masculine; but he exhibited, sometimes, a softness of feeling which might almost be called tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>A marked trait of his character was this: that if he had offended anybody, or wounded their feelings, he could never rest until he had in some way made amends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>His temper was irascible at times, and he would utter harsh words; but the flaming eyes soon softened, the arrogant manner disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>In <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> his arm would probably be upon the shoulder or around the neck of the injured individual, and his voice would become <hi rend="italics">caressante</hi>. This was almost amusing, and showed his good heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Like a child, he must <quote>make up</quote> with people he had unintentionally offended; and he never rested until he succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Let it not be understood, however, that this placability of temperament came into play in <quote>official</quote> affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>There <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00017.00085" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was as hard as adamant, and nothing moved him. He never forgave opposition to his will, or disobedience of his orders; and though never bearing malice, was a thoroughly good hater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>His prejudices were strong; and when once he had made up his mind deliberately, nothing would change him. He was immovable and implacable; and against these offenders he threw the whole weight of his powerful will and his high position, determined to crush them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>That, however, was in public and official matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>In all the details of his daily life he was thoroughly lovable, as many persons still living can testify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>He was the most approachable of major-generals, and jested with the private soldiers of his command as jovially as though he had been <num value="1">one</num> of themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The men were perfectly unconstrained in his presence, and treated him more like the chief huntsman of a hunting party than as a major-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>His staff were greatly attached to him, for he sympathized in all their affairs as warmly as a brother, and was constantly doing them some <quote>good turn.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>When with them off duty, he dropped every indication of rank, and was as much a boy as the youngest of them-playing marbles, quoits, or snowball, with perfect abandon and enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Most charming of all in the eyes of those gentlemen was the fact that he would not hesitate to decline invitations to entertainments, on the plainly stated ground <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> that <quote>his staff were not included</quote> --after which I need give myself no further trouble to explain why he was the most beloved of generals! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>I have spoken of his reckless exposure of his person in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>It would convey a better idea of his demeanour under fire to say that he seemed unaware of the presence of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>This air of indifference was unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>When brave men were moving restlessly, or unconsciously <quote>ducking</quote> to avoid the bullets showering around them, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00018.00086" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> sat his horse, full front to the fire, with head up, form unmoved &mdash; a statue of unconsciousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>It would be difficult to conceive of a greater coolness and indifference than he exhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The hiss of balls, striking down men around him, or cutting off locks of his hair and piercing his clothes, as at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, did not seem to attract his attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>With shell bursting right in his face and maddening his horse, he appeared to be thinking of something else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>In other men what is called <quote>gallantry</quote> is generally seen to be the effect of a strong will; in <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00018.00087" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> it seemed the result of indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>A stouter-hearted cavalier could not be imagined; and if his indifference gave way, it was generally succeeded by gaiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Sometimes, however, all the tiger was aroused in him. His face flushed; his eyes darted flame; his voice grew hoarse and strident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>This occurred in the hot fight of <placeName key="tgn,2331659" n="1.000 7" reg="fleetwood hill, culpeper, virginia">Fleetwood Hill</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1863-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, when he was almost surrounded by the heavy masses of the enemy's cavalry, and very nearly cut off; and again near <placeName key="tgn,2114702" n="1.000 27" reg="upperville, fauquier, virginia">Upperville</placeName>, later in the same year, when he was driven back, foot by foot, to the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>His voice was curt, harsh, imperious, admitting no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The veins in his forehead grew black, and the man looked <quote>dangerous.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>If an officer failed him at such moments, he never forgave him; as the man who attracted his attention, or who volunteered for a forlorn hope, was never forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>In his tenacious memory, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00018.00089" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> registered everybody; and in his command, his word, bad or good, largely set up or pulled down. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>To dwell still for a few moments upon the private and personal character of the man-he possessed some accomplishments unusual in famous soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>He was an excellent writer, and his <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> general orders were frequently very striking for their point and eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>That in which he called on his men after the ride around <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00019.00090" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to <quote>avenge <persName n="Latane,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00019.00091" reg="mostcommon:Latane,nomatch:0"><surname>Latane</surname></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>There was something of the <name>Napoleonic</name> fervour in these compositions, and, though dashed off rapidly, they were pointed, correct, and without bombast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>His letters, when collected, will be found clear, forcible, and often full of grace, elegance, and wit. He occasionally wrote verses, especially parodies, for which he had a decided turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Some of these were excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>His letters, verses, and orders, were the genuine utterances of the man; not laboured or <quote>stiff,</quote> but spontaneous, flowing and natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>He had in conversation some humour, but more wit; and of <hi rend="italics">badinage</hi> it might almost be said he was a master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>His repartee was excellent, his address ever gay and buoyant, and in whatever society he was thrown he never seemed to lose that unaffected mirthfulness which charms us more perhaps than all other qualities in an associate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>I need scarcely add that this uniform gaiety was never the result of the use of stimulants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00019.00093" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> never drank a single drop of any intoxicating liquid in his whole life, except when he touched to his lips the cup of sacramental wine at the communion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>He made that promise to his mother in his childhood, and never broke it. <quote>If ever I am wounded,</quote> he said to me <num value="1">one</num> day, <quote>don't let them give me any whiskey or brandy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>His other habits were as exemplary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>I never saw him touch a card, and he never dreamed of uttering an oath under any provocation-nor would he permit it at his quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>He attended church whenever he could, and sometimes, though not often, had service at his headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/><num value="1">One</num> day a thoughtless officer, who did not <quote>know his man,</quote> sneered at preachers in his presence, and laughed at some <num value="1">one</num> who had entered the ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>This was the frivolous, irreverent, <hi rend="italics">hard-drinking</hi> personage of some people's fancies &mdash; the man who was sneered at as little better than a reprobate by those whom he had punished, and who, therefore, hated and slandered him! </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Such, in brief outline, was this <quote>Flower of cavaliers,</quote> as he moved in private, before the eyes of friends, and lived his life of gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>An estimate of the military and intellectual calibre of the man remains to be made &mdash; a rapid delineation of those traits of brain and nerve combined which made him the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Cav">first cavalry</orgName> officer of his epoch &mdash; I had nearly written of any epoch. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Out of his peculiar sphere he did not display marked ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>His mind was naturally shrewd, and, except in some marked instances, he appeared to possess an instinctive knowledge of men. But the processes of his brain, on ordinary occasions, exhibited rather activity and force than profoundness of insight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>His mental organization seemed to be sound and practical rather than deep and comprehensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>He read little when I knew him, and betrayed no evidences of wide culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>His education was that of the gentleman rather than the scholar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/><quote><placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s Maxims,</quote> a translation of <persName n="Jomini,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00020.00095" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><surname>Jomini</surname></persName>'s Treatise on War, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> similar works, were all in which he appeared to take pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>His whole genius evidently lay in the direction of his profession, and even here many persons doubted the versatility of his faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It will remain an interesting problem whether he would have made a great infantry commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>He was confident of his own ability; always resented the <hi rend="italics">dictum</hi> that he was a mere <quote>cavalry officer;</quote> and I believe, at <num value="1">one</num> time, it was the purpose of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities to place him in command of a corps of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Upon the question of his capacity, in this sphere, there will probably be many opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>At <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, when he succeeded <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00020.00096" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, the troops, although quite enthusiastic about him, complained that he had led them too recklessly against artillery; and it is hard for those who knew the man to believe that, as an army commander, he would ever have consented to a strictly defensive campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Fighting was a necessity of his blood, and the slow movements of infantry did not suit his genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>With an army under him, it is probable that he would either have achieved magnificent successes or sustained <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> overwhelming defeats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>I confess I thought him equal to anything in his profession, but competent judges doubted it. What every <num value="1">one</num> agreed about, however, was his supreme genius for fighting cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>He always seemed to me to be intended by nature for this branch of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Some men are born to write great works, others to paint great pictures, others to rule over nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00021.00097" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was born to fight cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>It was only necessary to be with him in important movements or on critical occasions, to realize this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>His instinct was unfailing, his <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> that of the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>He was a trained soldier, and had truly graduated at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, but it looked like instinct rather than calculation &mdash; that rapid and unerring glance which took in at once every trait of the ground upon which he was operating, and anticipated every movement of his adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>I never knew him to blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>His glance was as quick, and reached its mark as surely as the lightning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Action followed like the thunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>In moments of great emergency it was wonderful to see how promptly he swept the whole field, and how quickly his mind was made up. He seemed to penetrate, as by a species of intuition, every design of his opponent, and his dispositions for attack or defence were those of a mastermind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Sometimes nothing but his unconquerable resolution, and a sort of desperation, saved him from destruction; but in almost every critical position which he was placed in during that long and arduous career, it was his wonderful acumen, no less than his unshrinking nerve, which brought him out victorious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>This nerve had in it something splendid and chivalric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It never failed him for a moment on occasions which would have paralysed ordinary commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>An instance was given in <dateStruct value="1863-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Near <placeName reg="Auburn, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2110491">Auburn</placeName> his column was surrounded by the whole of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0011.0002.00021.00098" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, then retiring before <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0002.00021.00099" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>An earlier instance was his raid in rear of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0011.0002.00021.00101" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> in <dateStruct value="1862-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, when, on reaching the lower <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, he found the stream swollen and unfordable, while at every moment an enraged enemy threatened to fall upon his rear with an overpowering force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Although the men were much disheartened, and were gloomy enough at the certain fate which seemed to await them, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00022.00102" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> remained cool and unmoved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>He intended, he said afterwards, to <quote>die game</quote> if attacked, but he believed he could extricate his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> he had built a bridge, singing as he worked with the men; and his column, with the guns, defiled across just as the enemy rushed on them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Upon these occasions and <num value="20">twenty</num> others, nothing but his stout nerve saved him from destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>This quality, however, would not have served him without the quick military instinct of the born soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>His great merit as a commander was, that his conception of <quote>the situation</quote> was as rapid and just as his nerve was steady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>His execution was unfaltering, but the brain had devised clearly what was to be done before the arm was raised to strike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The faculty would have achieved great results in any department of arms; but in cavalry, the most <quote>sudden and dangerous</quote> branch of the service, where everything is decided in a moment as it were, it made <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00022.00106" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> soldiers of his epoch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It was in the raid, the flank movement, the charge, and the falling back, with cavalry proper, however, that he exhibited the most conspicuous traits of the soldier.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>As his physical energies thus never seemed to droop, or sprang with a rebound from the weight on them, so he never desponded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>A stouter heart in the darkest hour I have never seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>No clouds could depress him or disarm his courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>He met ill-fortune with a smile, and drove it before him with his gallant laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Gloom could not live in his presence, and the whole race of <quote>croakers</quote> were shamed into hopefulness by his inspiring words and demeanour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Defeat and disaster seemed to make him stronger and more resolute, and he rose under pressure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>In moments of the most imminent peril to the very existence of his command, I have seen him drum carelessly with his fingers on the knee thrown over the pommel of his saddle, reflect for an instant without any trace of excitement, and then give the order to cut a path through the enemy, without the change of a muscle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>At such moments, it was plain that <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00024.00118" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> coolly made up his mind to do his best, and leave the rest to the chances of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>That stout heart seemed invincible, and impending ruin could not shake it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>When not rejoicing like the hunter on the traces of the game, he was cool, resolute, and determined, evidently <quote>to do or die.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The <hi rend="italics">mens oequa in arduis</hi> shone in the piercing blue eye, and his undaunted bearing betrayed a soul which did not mean to yield &mdash; which might be crushed and shattered, but would not bend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>His dash and impetuosity in the charge have scarcely been alluded to, and yet it was these characteristics of the man which chiefly impressed the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>On a former page he has been compared to <persName><foreName>Rupert</foreName></persName>, the darling of love and war, who was never so well satisfied as when dashing against the <rs type="place">Roundhead pikes</rs> and riding down his foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Here the man was superb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It was in attack, after all, that his strongest faculties were exhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Indeed, the whole genius and temperament of the <rs>Virginian</rs> were for advancing, not retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>He could fall back stubbornly, as has been shown; and he certainly did so in a masterly manner, disputing every inch of ground with his adversary, and giving way to an enemy's advance under bloody protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>At these times he displayed the obstinate temper of the old Ironsides of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0011.0002.00028.00142" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, when they retired in serried ranks, ready to turn as they slowly retreated, and draw blood with their iron claws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>But when advancing upon an adversary &mdash; more than all in the impetuous charge-Stuart as no longer the <name>Roundhead</name>; he was the <name>Cavalier</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Cavalier he was by birth and breeding and temperament; and he sprang to meet an enemy, as <persName><foreName>Rupert</foreName></persName> drove forward in the hot struggle of the past in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>it was neck or nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>When he thus <quote>came to the sabre,</quote> there was no such word as fail with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>That was the enemy in front; and to ride over, and cut right and left among them, was the work before him. At such moments there was something grand in the magnificent fire and rush of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>He seemed strong enough to ride down a world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Only a glance was needed to tell you that this man had made up his mind to break through and trample under foot what opposed him, or <quote>die trying.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>His men knew this; and, when he took personal command of the column, as he most often did, prepared for tough work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>His occasional roughness of address to both <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> officers and men had made him bitter enemies, but the admiration which he aroused was unbounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The men were often heard to say, in critical places: <quote>There goes old <persName><foreName>Jeb</foreName></persName> to the front, boys; it's all right.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>And an officer whom he had offended, and who hated him bitterly, declared with an oath that he was the greatest cavalry commander that had ever lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>He estimated justly his own value as a fighting man, when he said <num value="1">one</num> day: <quote>My proper place would be major of artillery;</quote> and it is certain that in command of a battalion of fieldpieces, he would have fought until the enemy were at the very muzzles of his guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>But in the cavalry he had even a better field for his love of close fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>To come to the sabre best suited his fiery organization, and he did come to it, personally, on many occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>He preferred saying, <quote>Come on</quote> to <quote>Go on.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The men declared that he was reckless, but no <num value="1">one</num> could say that he had ever sent his column where he was not ready to go himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>If he made a headlong and determined attack upon an overpowering force &mdash; a thing common with him-he was in front himself, or fighting among the men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>After <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions of reckless exposure of himself, I said to him: <quote>General, you ought not to put yourself in the way of the bullets so; some day you will be killed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He sighed and replied: <quote>Oh, I reckon not; but if I am, they will easily find somebody to fill my place.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>He had evidently determined to spend and be spent in the <rs>Southern</rs> struggle, which had aroused his most passionate sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>This love of native land came to add a magnificent fervour to the natural combativeness of the man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/><pb id="p.30" n="30"/> </p> 
<p>This indifference to danger was evidently a trait of blood, and wholly unaffected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Nor, for a long time, did his incessant exposure of himself bring him so much as a scratch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>No trait is feigned or fanciful, and the picture is not exaggerated, though it may seem so to some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The organization of this man was exceptional and very remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The picture seems a fancy piece, perhaps, but it is the actual portrait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The gaiety, nerve, courage, dash, and stubborn resolution of that man were as great as here described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>These were the actual traits which made him fill so great a space in the <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> public eye; and as what he effected was not <quote>done in a corner,</quote> so what he was became plain to all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>He was hated bitterly by some who had felt the weight of his hot displeasure at their shortcomings, and some of these people tried to traduce and slander him. They said he was idle and negligent of his duties-he, the hardest worker and most wary commander I ever saw. They said, in whispers behind his backin that tone which has been described as <quote>giggle-gabble</quote> --that he thought more of dancing, laughing, and trifling with young ladies than of his military work, when those things were only the relaxations of the man after toil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>They said that ladies could wheedle and cajole him-when he arrested hundreds, remained inexorable to their petitions, and meted out to the <quote>fairest eyes that ever have shone</quote> the strictest military justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>They said that he had wreaths of flowers around his horse, and was <quote>frolicking</quote> with his staff at <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName>, so that his headquarters on <placeName key="tgn,2331659" n="1.000 7" reg="fleetwood hill, culpeper, virginia">Fleetwood Hill</placeName> were surprised and captured in <dateStruct value="1863-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, when he had not been at the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> for days; sent off every trace of his headquarters at dawn, <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure> before the enemy advanced; and was ready for them at every point, and drove them back with heavy loss beyond the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In like manner the <name>Sleeks</name> sneered at his banjo, sneered at his gay laughter, sneered at his plume, his bright colours, and his merry songs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The same good friends invented stories of rebukes he had incurred from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0002.00031.00153" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, when he uniformly received from that great friend and commander the highest evidences of regard and confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>They flushed the face of the proud and honest cavalier, sometimes, and made the blue eyes flash; but what could he do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The calumnies were nameless; their authors slunk into shadow, and shrank from him. So he ended by laughing at them, as the country did, and going on his way unmindful of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>He answered slander by brave action-calumny by harder work, more reckless exposure of himself, and by grander achievements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Those secret <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> enemies might originate the falsehoods aimed at him from their safe refuge in some newspaper office, or behind some other <quote>bomb-proof</quote> shelter-he would <hi rend="italics">fight</hi>. That was his reply to them, and the scorn extinguished them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The honest gentleman and great soldier was slandered, and he lived down the slanderfighting it with his sword and his irreproachable life, not with his tongue. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/></p> 
<p>The brief and splendid career in which he won his great renown, and that name of the <quote>Flower of cavaliers,</quote> has scarcely been touched on in this rapid sketch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The arduous work which made him so illustrious has not been described &mdash; I have been able to give only an outline of the man. That picture may be rude and hasty, but it is a likeness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The reader must have formed some idea of him, hasty and brief as the delineation has necessarily been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I have tried to draw him as the determined leader, full of fire and force; the stubborn fighter; the impetuous cavalier in the charge; the, at times, hasty and arrogant, but warm-hearted friend; the devoted <rs>Christian</rs>, husband, and father; the gayest of companions; full of fun, frolic, laughter, courage, hope, buoyancy, and a certain youthful joyousness which made his presence like the sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Upon this last trait I have dwelt much &mdash; the youth, and joy, and hope, which shone in his brilliant eyes and rang in his sonorous laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>He passed before you like an incarnate spring, all mirth and sunshine; but behind was the lightning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>In those eyes as fresh and blue as the <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> morning, lurked the storm and the thunderbolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Beneath the flowers was the hard steel battle-axe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>That stalwart form had everywhere towered in the van.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>But the record of those stubborn fights must be left to another time and to abler hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>I pass to a few traits of the individual. </p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.1.4.13" type="section" n="c.1.4.13"> <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> 
<head><num value="2">II</num>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Of this eminent soldier, I will say that, seeing him often in many of those perilous straits which reveal hard fibre or its absence, I always regarded him as a noble type of courage and manhooda gentleman and soldier <quote>to the finger nails.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>But that is not enough; generalization and eulogy are unprofitable-truth and minute characterization are better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/><num value="1">One</num> personal anecdote of <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00306" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,Augustus,,,:2"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName> would be far more valuable than a <num value="100">hundred</num> commonplaces-and that is true of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>It is not a <quote>general idea</quote> I am to give; I would paint the portrait, if I can, of the actual man. The individuality of the great <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> was very marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>You saw at a glance the race from which he sprang, and the traits of heart and brain which he brought to the hard contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>He was <quote>whole in himself and due to none.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Neither in physical nor mental conformation did he resemble <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00307" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, the ideal cavalier-Forrest, the rough-rider-or the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>To compare him for an instant to the famous <rs>Stuart</rs> &mdash;&mdash; the latter laughed, sang, and revelled in youth and enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/><persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00308" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> smiled oftener than he laughed, never sang at all that I ever heard, and had the composed demeanour of a man of middle age. <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00309" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> loved brilliant colours, gay scenes, and the sparkle of bright eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/><persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00310" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> gave little thought to these things; and his plain gray coat, worn, dingy, and faded, beside the great cavalier's gay <quote>fighting jacket,</quote> shining with gold braid, defined the whole difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>I do not say that the dingy coat covered a stouter heart than the brilliant jacket &mdash; there never lived a more heroic soul than <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00311" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> --but that in this was shown the individuality of each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The <num value="1">one</num>-<persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00312" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> &mdash; was young, gay, a West Pointer, and splendid in his merriment, <hi rend="italics">elan</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">abandon</hi>. The other, <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00313" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, a civilian approaching middle age, a planter, not a soldier by profession-a man who embarked in the arduous struggle with the coolness of the statesman, rather than the ardor of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>It was the planter, sword in hand, not the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officer, that <num value="1">one</num> saw in <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00051.00314" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> &mdash; the country gentleman who took up arms because his native soil was invaded, as the race of which he came <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> had done in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>That the plain planter, without military education, became the eminent soldier, is an evidence that <quote>the strain will show.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/></p> 
<p>Here is an outline of the <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> as he appeared in <dateStruct value="1862-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, when the cavalry were resting after the battles of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and he often came to the old shady yard of <placeName reg="Hanover Court-House">Hanover Court-House</placeName>, to talk with <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0004.00052.00315" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> under the trees there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>What the eye saw in those days was a personage of tall stature and <quote>distinguished</quote> appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>The face was browned by sun and wind, and half covered by dark side-whiskers joining a long moustache of the same hue; the chin bold, prominent, and bare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>The eyes were brown, inclining to black, and very mild and friendly; the voice low, sonorous, and with a certain accent of dignity and composure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>The frame of the soldier-straight, vigorous, and stalwart, but not too broad for grace &mdash; was encased in a plain gray <rs n="sack coat" type="product">sack coat</rs> of civilian cut, with the collar turned down; cavalry boots, large and serviceable, with brass spurs; a brown felt hat, without star or feather; the rest of the dress plain gray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>Imagine this stalwart figure with a heavy sabre buckled around the waist, and mounted upon a large and powerful animal of excellent blood and action, but wholly <quote>unshowy,</quote> and a correct idea will be obtained of <persName n="Hampton,General,Wade,,," id="n0011.0004.00052.00316" reg="default:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Wade</foreName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Passing from the clothes to the man-what impressed all who saw him was the attractive union of dignity and simplicity in his bearing &mdash; a certain grave and simple courtesy which indicated the highest breeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>He was evidently an honest gentleman who disdained all pretence or artifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>It was plain that he thought nothing of personal decorations or military show, and never dreamed of <quote>producing an impression</quote> upon any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>This was revealed by that bearing full of a proud modesty; neither stiff nor insinuating-simple. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>After being in his presence for <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>, you saw that he was a man for hard work, and not for display.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>That plain and unassuming manner, without pretension, affectation, or <quote>official</quote> coolness, was an index to the character of the individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>It is easy to tell a gentleman; something betrays that character, <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> as something betrays the pretender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Refinement, good-breeding, and fealty through all, to honour, were here embodied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The General was as courteous to the humblest private soldier as to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, and you could discover in him no trace whatever of that air of <quote>condescension</quote> and <quote>patronage</quote> which small persons, aiming to be great, sometimes adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>It was the unforced courtesy of the gentleman, not the hollow politeness of the pretender to that title, which all saw in <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00053.00317" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>He did not act at all, but lived his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>In his voice, in his bearing, in all that he said and did, the <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> betrayed the man who is too proud not to be simple, natural, and unassuming. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Upon this trait of manner, merely, I may seem to dwell too long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>But it is not a trifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>I am trying to delineate a man of whom we Southerners are proud-and this rare grace was his. It reflected clearly the character of the individual &mdash; the noble pride, the true courtesy, and the high-bred honour of <num value="1">one</num> who, amid all the jarring stife of an excited epoch, would not suffer his serene equanimity of gentleman to be disturbed; who aimed to do his duty to his country, not rise above his associates; who was no politer to the high than to the low, to the powerful than to the weak; and who respected more the truth and courage beneath the tattered jacket than the stars and wreath on the braided coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The result of this kindly feeling towards <quote>men of low estate</quote> was marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>An officer long associated with him said to me <num value="1">one</num> day: <quote>I do not believe there ever was a General more beloved by his whole command; and he more than returns it. <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0011.0004.00053.00318" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> has <hi rend="italics">a real tenderness</hi>, I do believe, for every soldier who has ever served under him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>He was always doing the poorer members of his command some kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>His hand was open like his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Many a brave fellow's family was kept from want by him; and a <num value="100">hundred</num> instances of this liberality are doubtless recorded in the grateful memories of the women and children whom he fought for, and fed too, in those dark days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>This munificence was nowhere else recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The left hand knew not what the right hand did. <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>A few words more upon his personal bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>His composure upon trying occasions, as in every-day life, indicated a selfpoised and independent character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>He rarely yielded to hearty mirth, but his smile was very friendly and attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>You could see that he was a person of earnest feelings, and had a good heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>In camp he was a pleasant companion, and those who saw him daily became most attached to him. His staff were devoted to him. I remember the regret experienced by these brave gentlemen when <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s assignment to the command of all the cavalry separated them from him. The feeling which they then exhibited left no doubt of the <hi rend="italics">entente cordiale</hi> between the members of the military family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/><persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0011.0004.00054.00319" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> liked to laugh and talk with them around the camp fire; to do them every kindness he could-but that was his weakness towards everybody-and to play chess, draughts, or other games, in the intervals of fighting or work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/><num value="1">One</num> of his passions was hunting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>This amusement he pursued upon every occasion-over the fields of <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName>, amid the woods of <placeName reg="Dinwiddie, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111478">Dinwiddie</placeName>, and on the rivers of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>His success was great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Ducks, partridges, squirrels, turkey, and deer, fell before his double-barrel in whatever country he pitched his tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>He knew all the old huntsmen of the regions in which he tarried, delighted to talk with such upon the noble science of venery, and was considered by these dangerous critics a thorough sportsman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>They regarded him, it is said, as a comrade not undistinguished; and sent him, in friendly recognition of his merit, presents of venison and other game, which was plentiful along the shores of the <name>Rowanty</name>, or in the backwoods of <placeName reg="Dinwiddie, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111478">Dinwiddie</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/><persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00054.00320" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> was holding the right of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0004.00054.00321" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s line there, in supreme command of all the <rs>Virginia</rs> cavalry; but it was not as a hunter of <quote>bluebirds</quote> --so we used to call our Northern friends &mdash; that they respected him most.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>It was as a deer hunter; and I have heard that the hard-fighting cavalier relished very highly their good opinion of him in that character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>It is singular that a love for hunting should so often characterize men of elegant scholarship and literary taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The soldier and huntsman was also a poet, and <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0004.00054.00322" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> spoke in high praise of his writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>His prose style was forcible and <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> excellent &mdash; in letters, reports, and all that he wrote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>The admirably written address to the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, which was recently published, will display the justice of this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>That paper, like all that came from him, was compact, vigorous, lucid, <quote>written in <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00055.00323" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>,</quote> and everywhere betrayed the scholar no less than the patriot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Such was the supreme control which this man of character, full of fire, force, and resolution, had over his passions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Under that sweetness and dignity which made him conspicuous among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gentlemen of his epoch, was the stubborn spirit of the born soldier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Little space is left to speak of him in his military character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>I preferred to dwell upon <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00055.00324" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> the man, as he appeared to me; for <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00055.00325" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> the <rs>General</rs> will find many historians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Some traits of the soldier, however, must not be omitted; this character is too eminent to be drawn only in profile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>On the field <rs>Hampton</rs> was noted for his coolness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>This never left him. It might almost be called repose, so perfect was it. He was never an excitable man; and as doubt and danger pressed heavier, his equanimity seemed to increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>You could see that this was truly a stubborn spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>I do not think that anybody who knew him could even imagine <placeName key="tgn,2096866" n="1.000 1" reg="wade hampton, greenville, south carolina">Wade Hampton</placeName> <quote>flurried.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>His nerve was made of invincible stuff, and his entire absence of all excitability on the field was spoken of by his enemies as a fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>It was said that his coolness amounted to a defect in a cavalry leader; that he wanted <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> the dash, rush, and impetus which this branch of the service demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>If there was any general truth in this criticism, there was none in particular instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>What the <rs>French</rs> call <hi rend="italics">elan</hi> is not, however, the greatest merit in a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Behind the strong arm was the wary brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Cool and collected resolution, a comprehensive survey of the whole field, and the most excellent dispositions for attack or defence-such were the merits of this soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>I could never divest myself of the idea that as a corps commander of infantry he would have figured among the most eminent names of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>With an unclouded brain; a <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> as clear as a ray of the sun; invincible before danger; never flurried, anxious, or despondent; content to wait; too wary ever to be surprised; looking to great trials of strength, and to general results &mdash; the man possessing these traits of character was better fitted, I always thought, for the command of troops of all arms-infantry, cavalry, and artillerythan for <num value="1">one</num> arm alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>But with that arm which he commanded --cavalry-what splendid results did he achieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>In how many perilous straits was his tall figure seen in front of the <rs>Southern</rs> horsemen, bidding them <quote>come on,</quote> not <quote>go on.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>He was not only the commander, but the <hi rend="italics">sabreur</hi> too. <num value="1000">Thousands</num> will remember how his gallant figure led the charging column at <placeName reg="Frederick City">Frederick City</placeName>, at <placeName key="tgn,2114702" n="1.000 27" reg="upperville, fauquier, virginia">Upperville</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, at <persName n="Trevillian,,,,," id="n0011.0004.00056.00327" reg="mostcommon:Trevillian,nomatch:0"><surname>Trevillian</surname></persName>'s, and in a <num value="100">hundred</num> other fights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>There was no flurry in the man-but determined resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>No doubt of the result apparently &mdash; no looking for an avenue of retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/><quote>Sabre to sabre!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>might have been taken as the motto of his banner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>In the <quote>heady fight</quote> he was everywhere seen, amid the clouds of smoke, the crashing shell, and the whistling balls, fighting like a private soldier, his long sword doing hard work in the <hi rend="italics">melee</hi>, and carving its way as did the trenchant weapons of the ancient knights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>This spirit of the thorough cavalier in <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName> is worth dwelling <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>It was not a merit in him or in others that they gave up wealth, business, elegance, all the comforts, conveniences, and serene enjoyments of life, to live hard and fight hard; to endure heat, cold, hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and pain, without a murmur; but it was a merit in this brave soldier and gentleman that he did more than his duty, met breast to breast in single combat the best swordsmen of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, counted his life as no more than a private soldier's, and seemed to ask nothing better than to pour out his heart's blood for the cause in which he fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>These men seemed to understand each other, and to be inspired by the same sentimenta love of their native land which never failed, and a willingness to spend and be spent to the last drop of their blood in the cause which they had espoused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>The man was quiet, silent, and seemed to be waiting calmly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>I pray the reader to pardon this long description of a smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>The closely buttoned garment displayed his vigorous chest; from the upper edge protruded a sharp, white, standing collar, and he wore the inseparable Zouave cap, with its straight rim projecting over the eyes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>The face of the soldier speedily drew attention, however, from his dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>The countenance, with its broad brow, firm mouth, covered with a heavy black moustache, and protruding chin, full of courage and resolution, was that of a <persName n="Marshal,,French,,," id="n0011.0006.00076.00485" reg="default:Marshal,French,,,"><foreName>French</foreName> <surname>Marshal</surname></persName> of the <rs>Empire</rs> to the very life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>The iron nerve of the man was indelibly stamped upon his features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>It was impossible to doubt the fighting instincts of the individual with that muscular contour of face which seemed to defy opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>The rest of the physiognomy was gaunt, hard, somewhat melancholy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>In the complexion was observable the <rs>Southern Creole</rs> descent of the soldier; it was brunette, sallow, and the sun and wind had made it resemble bronze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>It had the dusky pallor, too, of care and watching &mdash; that bloodless hue which the pressure of heavy responsibilities produces in the human face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>The position of an army leader is not a bed of roses, and the bloom of youth and health soon fades from the cheeks which are hollowed by the anxieties of command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>Large, dark, melancholy, with the lids drooping and somewhat inflamed by long vigils &mdash; of a peculiar dreamy expression-those eyes impressed the beholder very strangely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>It was the eye of the bloodhound with his fighting instincts asleep, but ready at any moment to be strung for action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>It was impossible not to be impressed by this resemblance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>Not that there was any ferocity or thirst for blood in that slumbrous <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> glance; but if ever <quote>fight</quote> was plain in any look-obstinate, pertinacious, hard <quote>fight</quote> --it was plain in <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0011.0006.00077.00486" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>Such was very far from the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>On the contrary, the manner of the individual was eminently modest, courteous, and pleasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>This may seem to clash with the bloodhound illustration-but both were true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>To see the grave commander assist the fair young lady to mount her horse was a <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> pleasing sight, and communicated much innocent enjoyment to the spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>Whether it was that the young lady thought it indecorous to make such use of that distinguished hand, or did not need his aid, I know not; she laughed, gracefully vaulted into her saddle, and mounting his own steed, the <rs>General</rs> gallantly took his place at her side. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>Without further preface, it may surprise some of my Northern readers to hear that this man, figuring in the popular eye as a ruffian and low adventurer, was born and bred, and is in character and manners, a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>When <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> seceded he imitated other young men, and embarked in the struggle as a private in a regiment of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>He returned to the ranks; but his energy and activity had been frequently exhibited, and <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0008.00104.00679" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, who possessed a remarkable talent for discovering conspicuous military merit of any sort in obscure persons, speedily sent for him, and from that time employed him as a scout or partisan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>If this information could be obtained without a collision, all the better; but, if necessary, it was the duty and the habit of the <name>Scouts</name> to attack, or when attacked, hold their ground as long as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>In other words, there was inaugurated in the country occupied by the <rs>Federal</rs> forces a regular system of partisan warfare, the object of which was to harass the invading force, and in every way impair its efficiency. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>A slight stoop in the neck was not ungraceful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>How crowded with great events that are history now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>Let us glance at it: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>When the <rs>Southern</rs> forces fell back from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, his batteries had their part in covering the movement, and guarding the fords of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>In the <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> battles around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> he won fadeless laurels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>Soon afterwards, at the <quote><placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White house</placeName>,</quote> he engaged a gunboat, and driving it away, after a brief but hot encounter, proved how fanciful were the terrors of these <quote>monsters.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/></p> 
<p>His greatest achievements were to come, however; and he hastened to record them on the enduring tablets of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>From the moment when his artillery advanced from the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, to the time when it returned thither, to the day of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, the path of the young leader was deluged with <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> the blood of <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>At <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName> he had command of nearly all the artillery on our left, and directed it with the hand of a master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>When the army crossed back into <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, he was posted at <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName>, and guarded the ford with an obstinate valour, which spoke in the regular and unceasing reverberation of his deep-mouthed Napoleons, as they roared on, hour after hour, driving back the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>Of the days which succeeded that exciting period, many persons will long hold the memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>It was in an honest old countryhouse, whither the tide of war bore him for a time, that the noble nature of the young soldier shone forth in all its charms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>There, in the old hall on the banks of the <placeName reg="Opequon river">Opequon</placeName>, surrounded by warm hearts who reminded him perhaps of his own beloved ones in far <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>; there, in the tranquil days of autumn, in that beautiful country, he seemed to pass some of his happiest hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>All were charmed with his kind temper and his sunny disposition; with his refinement, his courtesy, his high breeding, and simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>Modest to a fault almost-blushing like a girl at times, and wholly unassuming in his entire deportment-he became a favourite with all around him, and secured that regard of good men and women which is the proof of high traits and fine instincts in its possessor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>In the beautiful autumn forests, by the stream with its great sycamores, and under the tall oaks of the lawn, he thus wandered for a time &mdash; an exile from his own land of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, but loved, admired, and cherished by warm hearts in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>When he left the haunts of <quote>The <rs>Bower</rs>,</quote> I think he regretted it. But work called him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>The fiat had gone forth from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00121.00803" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> that another <quote>On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></quote> should be attempted; and where the vultures of war hovered, there was the post of duty for the <orgName type="mil" key="CavArtillery">Horse Artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>The cavalry crossed the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, and met the advancing column at Aldie-and <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00121.00804" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName> was again in his element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>Thenceforward, until the banks of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName> were reached by the cavalry, the batteries of the <orgName type="mil" key="CavArtillery">Horse Artillery</orgName> disputed every step of ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>The direction of the artillery was left, with unhestitating confidence, by <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00121.00805" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to the young officer; and those <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> who witnessed, during that arduous movement, the masterly handling of his guns, can tell how this confidence was justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>It was the eye of the great soldier, the hand of the born artillerist, which was evident in his work during those days of struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>He fell back neither too soon nor too late, and only limbered up his guns to unlimber again in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> position which he reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Thus fighting every inch of the way from <placeName key="tgn,2110255" n="1.000 78" reg="aldie, loudoun, virginia">Aldie</placeName>, round by <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00122.00806" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, and <placeName reg="Markham, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2112909">Markham</placeName>'s, he reached the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and posted his artillery at the fords, where he stood and bade the enemy defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>That page in the history of the war is scarcely known; but those who were present know the obstinacy of the contests, and the nerve and skill which were displayed by the young officer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>That may be unknown, but the work done by <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00122.00807" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName> on the great day of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> is a part of history now. All know how stubbornly he stood on that day-what laurels encircled his young brow when night at last came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>This was the climax of his fame &mdash; the event with which his name will be inseparably connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>With <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00122.00808" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> gun, he opened the battle on the right, and instantly drew upon himself the fire, at close range, of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> batteries in front, and a heavy enfilading fire from <num value="30">thirty</num>-pound Parrots across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>But this moved him little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>That <name type="weapon">Napoleon gun</name> was the same which he had used at the battle of Cold Harbour &mdash; it was taken from the enemy at <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>-and, in the hands of the young officer, it had won a fame which must not be tarnished by defeat!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Its grim voice must roar, however great the odds; its reverberating defiance must roll over the plain, until the bronze war-dog was silenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>So it roared on steadily with <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00122.00809" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName> beside it, blowing up caissons, and continuing to tear the enemy's ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>It was glorious indeed to see that <num value="1">one</num> gun, placed in an important position, hold its ground with a firmness so unflinching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>Not until his last round of ammunition was shot away did <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00122.00811" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName> retire; and then only after a peremptory order sent to him. He afterwards took command of the entire artillery on the right, and fought it until night with a skill and courage which <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> were admirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>He advanced his guns steadily, and at nightfall was thundering on the flank of the retreating enemy, who no longer replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>No answering roar came back from those batteries he had fought with his <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00123.00812" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> so long; he had triumphed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>That triumph was complete, and placed for ever upon record when the great <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, whom he loved and admired so ardently, gave him the name in his report of <quote>the gallant <rs>Pelham</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/></p> 
<p>Supreme tribute to his courage-immortalizing him in history!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>To be the sole name mentioned beneath the rank of <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> in all that host of heroes-and mentioned as <quote>the gallant <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00123.00813" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/></p> 
<p>Thenceforward there was little for him to desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>He had never cared for rank, only longed for glory; and now his name was deathless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>It is true that he sometimes said, with modest and noble pride, that he thought it somewhat hard to be considered too young for promotion, when they gave him great commands --as at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName> and Fredericksburg-and called on him when the hardest work was to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>But he never desired a mere title he had not won, and did his soldier's duty thoroughly, trusting to time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>So noble and important, however, had been his recent services, that promotion was a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> said, <quote>I do not need to see any papers about <persName n="Pelham,Major,,,," id="n0011.0009.00123.00814" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Pelham</surname></persName>,</quote> and had appointed him a <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs>; and it only awaited the formal confirmation of the <name>Senate</name>, when he fell on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>His fall was a public calamity to the nation, but none to him. It was fit that such a spirit should lay down his great work before the hard life of the world had dimmed the polish of the good knight's spotless shield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>He wanted no promotion at the hands of men. He had won, if not worn, the highest honours of the great soldier; and having finished his task, the gentle spirit took its flight, promoted by the tender hand of Death to other honours in a brighter world.</p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>In this hasty tribute to <num value="1">one</num> whom I knew well, and loved much, it is hard to avoid the appearance of exaggeration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>The <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> character of this young soldier was so eminently noble-his soul so brave, so true, so free from any taint of what was mean or sordid or little &mdash; that the sober words of truth may be doubted by some, who will only regard them as that tender and pious flattery which friendship accords to the dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>This sentiment will be experienced only by strangers, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>Those who knew him will recognise the true portrait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>His modesty, his gentleness-his bearing almost childlike in its simplicity-made his society charming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>This modesty of deportment was observed by every <num value="1">one</num>, and strangers often referred to the singular phenomenon in a youth bred in the self-sufficient atmosphere of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and whose name was already so famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>He never spoke of himself; you might live with him for a month, and never know that he had been in a single action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>He never seemed to think that he deserved any applause for his splendid courage, and was silent upon all subjects connected with his own actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>In his purse was found folded away, after his death, a slip from a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officer, once his friend, which contained the words, <quote>After long silence, I write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you, dear <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00124.00815" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName>; I am proud of your success.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>But he had never even alluded to the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>Distinguished unmistakably by the affection and admiration of his immediate General-rendered famous by the praise of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> at Fredericksburg-he never exhibited the least trait of self-love, remaining what he had always been, as modest, unassuming, and simple as a child. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>This and other winning traits come to my mind as I write, and I could speak at length of all those charming endowments which endeared him to every <num value="1">one</num> around him. I could dwell on his nice sense of honour-his devotion to his family &mdash; on that <hi rend="italics">prisca fides</hi> in his feeling and opinions which made him a great, true type of the <rs>Southern</rs> gentleman, attracting the attention and respect of the most eminent personages of his time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>But with the recollection of those eminent social characteristics comes the memory always of his long, hard work in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>I have often seen him engaged in that work, which gave him his great <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> fame; and this phase of the young officer's character obtrudes itself, rounding and completing the outline. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>With what obstinate and unyielding courage he fought!-with a daring how splendid, how rich in suggestion of the antique days!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>He entered upon a battle with the coolness and resolution of a great leader trained in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> combats, and fought his guns with the fury and <hi rend="italics">elan</hi> of <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00125.00816" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> at the head of his horsemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>No trait of the ground, no movement of the enemy, ever escaped his eagle eye. With an inborn genius for war which <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> had merely developed, and directed in its proper channels, he had the rapid comprehension-intuition almostwhich counts for so much in a leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>Where the contest was hottest and the pressure heaviest, there was <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0011.0009.00125.00817" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName> with his guns; and the broken lines of infantry, or cavalry giving ground before irresistible numbers, heard their deep voices roaring and saw the ranks of the enemy scattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>Often he waited for no order, took the whole responsibility, and opened his batteries where he saw that they were most needed by the emergencies of the moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>But what he did was always the very best that could be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>He struck at the right moment, and his arm was heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>Beside those guns was the chosen post of the young artillerist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>The <hi rend="italics">gaudium certaminis</hi> seemed to fill his being at such moments; and, however numerous the batteries which he threw into action, he never remained behind <quote>in command of the whole field.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>He <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> told me that he considered this his duty, and I know that he never shrank &mdash; as he might have done &mdash; from performing it. He was ever by the guns which were under the hottest fire, and, when the enemy shifted their fire to other portions of the field, he proceeded thither, riding at full speed, and directed the fresh batteries in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>His men will remember how cheering and inspiring was his presence with them-how his coolness steadied them in the most exciting moments-and his brave, cheerful voice was the herald of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/><quote>He was the bravest human being I ever saw in my life,</quote> said <num value="1">one</num> of his officers whom I conversed with recently; and all who have seen him under fire will bear similar testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>His coolness had something heroic in it. It never deserted him, or was affected by those chances of battle which excite the bravest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>He saw guns shattered and dismounted, or men torn to pieces, without exhibiting any signs of emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>His nature seemed strung and every muscle braced to a pitch which made him rock; and the ghastliest spectacle of blood and death left his soul unmoved-his stern will unbent. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>His manner was the perfection of good-breeding, and you saw that the famous partisan, whose exploits were the theme of every tongue, had not been raised, like others of his class, amid rude associates and scenes, but with gently nurtured women, and surrounded by the sweet amenities of home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>His voice was a peculiar <num value="1">one</num>-very low and distinct in its tones; and these subdued inflections often produced upon the listener the impression that it was a habit acquired in scouting, when to speak above a murmur is dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>The low, clear words were habitually accompanied by a bright smile, and the young man was a favourite with all-so cordial was his bearing, so unassuming his whole demeanour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>I have spoken of his modest, almost shy demeanour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>All this disappeared in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>His coolness remained unaffected, but he evidently felt himself in his proper element, and entitled to <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> direct others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>At such moments his suggestions were boldly made, and not seldom resulted in the rout of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>The cavalry once in motion, the quiet, modest gentleman was metamorphosed into the fiery partisan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>He would lead a charge with the reckless daring of <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n0011.0010.00139.00873" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName>, and cheer on the men, with contagious ardour, amid the most furious storm of balls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>His disregard of personal exposure was supreme, and the idea that he was surrounded by peril never occurred to him. He has repeatedly told the present writer, with that simplicity and sincerity which produce conviction, that in action he was wholly unconscious of the balls and shells flying and bursting around him &mdash; that his interest in the general result was so strong as to cause him to lose sight of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>Those who knew him did not venture to doubt the assertion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>He delighted in the wild charge, the clash of meeting squadrons, and the roar of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>All these martial sights and sounds ministered to the passionate ardour of that temperament which made him most at home where balls were whistling, and the air oppressive with the odour of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>But, I think, he even preferred the life of the scout &mdash; the long and noiseless hunt for his foe &mdash; the exercise of those faculties, by means of which an enemy is surprised and destroyed &mdash; the single combat with sabre and pistol, often far off in the silence of the woods, where a dead body half concealed amid the grass is all that remains to tell the tale of some hand-to-hand encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>The number of such contests through which <persName n="Farley,,,,," id="n0011.0010.00139.00874" reg="nearbymention:Farley,William,Downs,,"><surname>Farley</surname></persName> had passed would seem incredible to those who did not know him, and thus comprehend how the naked truth of his career beggared romance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>He rarely spoke of these affairs, and never, unless to certain persons, and under peculiar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>He had a great horror of appearing to boast of his own exploits, and so greatly feared securing the reputation of colouring his adventures that he seldom alluded to them, even.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>Fortunately for his memory, many persons witnessed his most desperate encounters, and still live to testify to the reckless daring of the young partisan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>With these his eventful career will long remain the subject of fireside tales; and in the coming days of peace, when years have silvered the hair of <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> his contemporaries, old men will tell their grand-children of his strange adventures and those noble traits which made his name so famous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>To the world at large, he will always thus appear &mdash; as the daring partisan and adventurous scout &mdash; as <num value="1">one</num> who risked his life in a <num value="100">hundred</num> hot encounters, and in all those bloody scenes never quailed or shrank before a foe, however powerful or dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>But to those who lived with him-heard his low, friendly voice, and saw every day his bright kindly smile-he appears in a different character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>To such the loss we have sustained is deeperit seems irreparable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>It was the good fortune of the writer of these lines to thus see the brave young man &mdash; to be beside him in the field; and, at home, to share his confidence and friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>Riding through the summer forests, or wandering on across the fields of broom-straw, near Fredericksburg-better still, beside the good log-fire of winter-we talked of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> things, and I saw what a wealth of kindness, chivalry, and honour he possessed-how beautifully the elements were mixed in his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>Often as I beheld such spectacles, this melancholy mansion attracted my attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>I drew up and turned around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>But what a change!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>He had always been the neatest person imaginable in his dress and appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>His brown hair had always been carefully parted and brushed, his boots as polished as assiduous rubbing could make them, and his new uniform coat, with its gay new braid, had been almost too nice and unwrinkled for a soldier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>His appearance was in vivid contrast with all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>He was coatless, unwashed, his boots covered with dust and his clothes had the dingy look of the real soldier, who is so often compelled to lie upon the ground, and to sleep in his apparel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>His hair was unbrushed, and hung disordered around his face, and the gallant young captain of the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">Signal Corps</orgName> had the appearance of a sapper and miner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>But the face was unchanged &mdash; that was the same; gay, ardent, joyous, as he held out his hand, and grasped mine with the same old friendly manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>He was evidently overjoyed to see a familiar face among all the strange ones around him, where the eye met only alien glances; to press a friendly hand where none seemed ready to stretch forth and greet him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>I can see the bright face now, as he turned it up and smiled; hear the voice with its tones of boyish music as he related his misfortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>Alas, that he has fallen in a contest so unequal!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>But who has fallen more honourably, more nobly?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>Young <persName n="Selden,,,,," id="n0011.0013.00147.00904" reg="nearbymention:Selden,William,,,"><surname>Selden</surname></persName>, too, died at his gun, while gallantly fighting the enemy that had gathered in so superior numbers upon our shores. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>Last night, when the steamer arrived at <placeName reg="Currituck, Mecklenburg, North Carolina" key="tgn,2272207">Currituck</placeName>, <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n0011.0013.00147.00905" reg="nearbymention:Wise,O.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> directed that the coffin containing the remains of his son be opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Then, I learn from those who were present, a scene transpired that words cannot describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>The old hero bent over the body of his son, on whose pale face the full moon threw its light, kissed the cold brow many times, and exclaimed, in an agony of emotion: <quote>Oh, my brave boy, you have died for me, you have died for me.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>Of the remarkable young man who thus poured forth his blood, and passed away, before the age of <num value="30">thirty</num>, in defence of his native soil, I propose to give a few personal recollections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>It is hard that a noble soul should go from the haunts of the living, to be remembered only by the small circle of loving friends who knew and appreciated him. And though I shall not attempt anything in the shape of a memoir of young <persName n="Wise,,Jennings,,," id="n0011.0013.00148.00906" reg="default:Wise,Jennings,,,"><foreName>Jennings</foreName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>, my few words may not prove uninteresting to those who watched, from a distance, his meteoric career, and perhaps admired his brave spirit, while ignorance of his real character led them to misunderstand him. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>How many memories that name recalls!--memories of gentleness and chivalry, and lofty honour, to those who knew him truly &mdash; of fancied arrogance and haughty pride, and bloody instincts, to those who accepted common rumour for their estimate of him. For there were many rumours of this description afloat-and it must be acknowledged that there was some excuse for the misconception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>He had little of the spirit of conciliation if he believed a man to be his foe; managed early to arouse bitter enmities; and continued to defy his opponents without deigning to explain his character or his motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>Before he was better understood-when the mists were only beginning to clear away, and show his virtues of devotion, and patriotism, and kindness-death called him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>Born in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and going in his early manhood to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> of Legation, he there perfected himself in riding, fencing, and all manly exercises; studying political science, and training himself, consciously or unconsciously, for the arena upon which he was to enter soon after his return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>He came to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> at a time when the atmosphere was stifling with the <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> heat of contending factions in politics, and becoming the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Editor">chief editor</rs> of the <orgName n="Richmond Enquirer" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi></orgName>, plunged into the struggle with all the ardour of a young and ambitious soldier who essays to test the use of those arms he has been long burnishing for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>He did not lack for opponents, for a great contest was raging, and the minds of men were red-hot with the mighty issues of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>He had scarce thrown down the glove when many hands were extended to take it up. Then commenced a strife on the political arena, in which the opponents fought each other with bitter and passionate vehemence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>What the pen wrote, the pistol, unhappily, was too often called upon to support; and the young politician was ere long engaged in more than <num value="1">one</num> duel, which achieved for him a widely-extended notoriety and a venomous party hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>Of these quarrels I do not design to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>It is no part of my purpose to inquire who was to blame or who was faultless; and I would not move the ashes resting now upon the details of those unhappy affairs, under which the fire perhaps still smoulders, full of old enmities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>That he was carried away by passion often, is unfortunately too true; but he had no love for conflict, and publicly declared his aversion to <quote>private war.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>Unhappily the minds of his political opponents were too profoundly swayed by the passions of the epoch to give him credit for these declarations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>They were not listened to, and the young politician became the mark of extreme political hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>The sins of passion and the heated arena were regarded as the coolly planned and deliberately designed crimes of a moral monster, who had never felt the emotion of pity or love for his brother man. Intelligent and honourable persons believed that all the young man's instincts were cruel; that his hatreds were capricious and implacable; that his nature was that of the tiger, thirsting for blood; his conscience paralysed or warped by a terrible moral disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>His splendid oratory, his trenchant pen, the dash and courage of his nature, were allowed; but these were his only <quote>good gifts;</quote> he was, they said, the <name>Ishmael</name> of the modern world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>All this he knew, and he continued his career, trusting to time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>He fought for secession; joined the <orgName type="regiment" key="1VARegiment">First Virginia Regiment</orgName>, <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> and served at <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, in the <rs>John Brown</rs> raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>Then war came in due time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>He was elected captain of the Blues-the oldest volunteer company in Virginia-took the leadership from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as <num value="1">one</num> born to command, and fought and fell at that bloody <placeName reg="Roanoke River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2621311">Roanoke</placeName> fight, at the head of his company, and cheering on his men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>His body was brought back to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, laid in the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName>, and buried, in presence of a great concourse of mourners, in <placeName reg="Hollywood Cemetery">Hollywood Cemetery</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>That was the end of the brief young life-death in defence of his native land, and a grave in the beloved soil, by the side of the great river, and the ashes of <persName n="Monroe,,,,," id="n0011.0013.00150.00908" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, brought thither by himself and his associates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>Then came a revulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>His character was better understood; his faults were forgotten; his virtues recognised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>Even his old opponents hastened to express their sympathy and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>It was remembered that more than once he had refused to return his adversary's fire; that championship of <num value="1">one</num> whom he loved more than life had inflamed his enmity &mdash; no merely selfish considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>His sweetness of temper and kindness were recalled by many, and the eyes which had been bent upon him with horror or hatred, shed tears beside the young soldier's grave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>Oh, tardy justice of good men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>Oh, laurel-wreath upon the coffin!-soft words spoken in the dull, cold ear of death!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>This soul of chivalry and honour-this gentle, kindly, simple hearthad been branded as the enemy of his species &mdash; as a haughty, soulless, pitiless monster! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>In speaking of this young Virginian, I wish to espouse no personal or party quarrel &mdash; to arouse none of those enmities which sleep now &mdash; to open no old wounds, and to fan into flame none of the heart-burnings of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>Those who contended with him most bitterly have long ago forgotten their feud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>Many shed tears for the noble youth when he fell, and speak of him now as <num value="1">one</num> of those great <persName n="Virginians,,,,," id="n0011.0013.00150.00909" reg="mostcommon:Virginians,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginians</surname></persName> whom it is the pride of our soil to have produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>They know him better now, and understand that this man was no hater of his species &mdash; no <persName><foreName>Ishmael</foreName></persName> of civilization, cold and haughty and implacable-but a beautiful and noble nature, attuned to every honourable impulse, and only <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> embittered temporarily by party passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Dying, he has suffered change; and there is a beauty in the pale, cold face, which it never possessed while living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>Traits never suspected come out now, when Death has stamped the countenance with his melancholy seal; and love and pity have quite banished the old scorn and hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>The green grass on his grave has covered all enmity, and the love of friends has taken the place of the bitterness of foes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Among those friends who knew and loved him living, I count myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>To know him thus was speedily to love him &mdash; for his traits and instincts were so conspicuously noble and endearing, that he irresistibly attracted the affection of all who were thrown in familiar contact with him. How gentle, modest, and unassuming these inner instincts of his heart were, those who knew him in his private life will bear witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>They will tell you of his honest and truthful nature; his unpretending simplicity; his chivalric impulses, and nobility of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>Indeed, you would have said that the <name>Creator</name> had breathed into this clay the loveliest traits of humanity, and raised up in the prosaic <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century a <quote>good knight</quote> of old days, to show the loveliness of honour. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> side of the young man's character, only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>With these softer traits were mingled some of the hardiest endowments of strong manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>No man was ever braver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>Indeed, his nerve had in it something antique and splendid, as of the elder days of chivalry, when neither monster nor magician, giant nor winged dragon, could make the heart of the good knight quail, or move him from his steadfast purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>What in other men was the courage of habit, or training, or calculation of forces, was in him that of native endowment and birthright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>To match himself, if need be, against any odds, however overwhelming, and breast all opposition with a stubborn, dauntless front, was to act as his character dictated, and to follow his temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>The sentiment of fear, I believe, never entered his breast; if it did, it never stayed there long enough for him to make its acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>He would have led the charge of the <rs>English</rs> cavalry at <placeName key="tgn,7010109" n="1.000 1" reg="balaklava,krym,ukrayina,europe">Balaklava</placeName> with the nerve and dash of Hotspur, glorying in <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> the roar of the enemy's artillery, and resolute to take their guns or die. At <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">Thermopylae</placeName>, he would have stood beside <persName n="Leonidas,,,,," id="n0011.0013.00152.00910" reg="mostcommon:Leonidas,nomatch:0"><surname>Leonidas</surname></persName>, and fought and died without the shudder of a nerve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>In battle at the head of his men, his coolness and resolution were invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>The grim front of war possessed no terrors for him, and he advanced into the gulf of battle with the calmness of a holiday soldier on parade.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>He sounded the onset, and the lines once in motion, he took his place in the great army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as a private, with musket on shoulder; eager, active, untiring; inspiring all with his own brave spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>Then, when his acknowledged capacity for leadership placed him at the head of a command, he took the post as his of right, and led his men as all who knew him expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>How he led them on that disastrous day at <placeName reg="Roanoke River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2621311">Roanoke</placeName> &mdash; with what heroic nerve, and splendid gallantry, in the face of the deadliest firelet his old comrades in arms declare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>There, in the front of battle, he fell-giving his life without a single regret to the cause he loved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>It was the phase of character, indicated above, which the outer world chiefly considered, and estimated him by. Yet this was by no means his most attractive phase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>The dauntless nerve, the stubborn and indomitable will, revealed themselves on certain occasions only &mdash; the social virtues of the individual were seen every day. It would be difficult to imagine a human being more modest, kindly, and simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>His modesty amounted almost to shyness; and it was doubtless this species of reserve which led many to regard him as cold, and destitute of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>Let it not be understood, however, that he was subject to <hi rend="italics">mauvaise honte</hi> --the diffidence of <num value="1">one</num> who distrusts his own powers, and shrinks <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> from collision with other minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>His peculiarity was rather the reverse, as his perfect self-possession and control of every faculty in public speaking indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>Self-reliance, rather than self-distrust, marked the character of his intellect-boldness to undertake, and unshrinking courage to execute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>But in this there was no arrogance &mdash; no <hi rend="italics">hauteur</hi>. In the combat he would contend with all his powers, and shrink from no odds: but the contest once over, the hot blood cool, the old modesty returned, and the kindly, gentle smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>The indulgence of his affections was evidently <num value="1">one</num> of his chief happinesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>He was fond of children, and delighted to play with them, sharing their gambols and amusements with the <hi rend="italics">bonhomie</hi> and abandon of a boy. In such scenes, the vehement young politician no doubt took refuge from the strife of the public arena, where so many hot passions met and clashed, and found in the playful antics of children the antidote to the scorns and hatreds of those grown &mdash; up childrenmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>It was in the society of the eminent <rs>Virginian</rs>, his father, however, that he seemed to experience his greatest happiness; and his devotion to him was the controlling sentiment of his being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>If this sentiment impelled him to a partisanship too violent at times, the fault will not be regarded as a mean or ignoble <num value="1">one</num>, nor detract in any measure from the character here attributed to him, of the kindest and simplest of gentlemen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>The intellect which accompanied this courageous spirit and kindly heart was eminently vigorous and original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>It was rather that of the actor than the thinker-rather, ready, acute, inventive and fruitful in resources-quick to move and to strike, in debate or reasoning with the pen-than deliberate, philosophic, or reflective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>It wanted the breadth and depth which result from study and meditation, but as a sharp and tempered weapon to accomplish direct tangible results, it was exceedingly forcible and effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>As a writer in the larger acceptation of the term, he was not conspicuously endowed; but his style as a journalist was fluent, eloquent, and when his nature was strongly moved, full of power and the fire of invective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>Some of his editorial writings deserve to be collected, and preserved in a permanent form, as among the most forcible expositions of the great principles <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> involved in the struggle which absorbed the energies of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>His most notable gift was unquestionably that of oratory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>He possessed native endowments which entitled him to very high rank as a public speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>In the columns of a daily journal his powers were always more or less cramped, and did not assert their full strength, but on <quote>the stump</quote> he was in his own element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>Here all the faculties of his intellect and nature had full swing, and <quote>ample room and verge enough</quote> for their exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>The spectator saw at a glance that the young man with the thin slight figure and quiet manner, was a born orator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> words justified the opinion, and stamped him as <num value="1">one</num> born to move, to sway, to direct the thoughts and the actions of men. The crowd --that unfailing critic of a public speaker's ability-always received him with acclamations, and hailed his appearance on the rostrum with loud applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>They felt that, youth as he was, and as yet untrained in the arts of the orator, he was a match for the oldest opponents, and they were content to leave the advocacy of great principles, at momentous crises, in the hands of this young man &mdash; to accept and rely on him as their champion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>He did not disappoint their expectations ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>A born politician, and thrilling with the great party issues before the country, he entered the arena with the bold and self-possessed demeanour of <num value="1">one</num> in his chosen element, and equal to the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>Political history &mdash; the careers of public men &mdash; the principles underlying the <rs>American</rs> frame of government-all were thoroughly familiar to him, and his knowledge was available at a moment's notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>His speeches were skilful combinations of philosophic reasoning anad hard-hitting illustrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>In the employment of invective, his handling was that of a master; and when his scorn of some unworthy action or character was fully aroused, his delivery of the scathing sarcasm or the passionate defiance was inexpressibly vehement and bitter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>Those who have seen the flashing eye and the scornful lip of the young orator at such times, will not readily forget them, or wonder at the wild excitement of the crowd as they listened to these outbursts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>Even the cool intellects of old men were taken captive with the rest, <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> and I think all who heard the youthful speaker, came away with the impression that time and training only were needed, to make him <num value="1">one</num> of the most famous orators of the old Commonwealth which has produced so many giants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>With the termination of his speeches disappeared all the passion, vehemence, and ardour of the man. The handkerchief passed over the damp brow, seemed to wipe away all excitement; and the fiery gladiator, swaying all minds by his fierce invective, or his vivid reasoning, subsided into the quiet, almost shy young man. The old modesty and simplicity of demeanour returned, and the forces of the vigorous intellect returned to rest, until some other occasion should call them into exercise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>I could add many things relating to this eminent young man in his personal and private character, but the subject may not interest the general reader as much as it does him who writes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>Perhaps, too, they are better kept for other years, when time shall have extinguished the few heart-burnings that remain, and obliterated the scars of old contests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>I have thought it right, however, to put thus much concerning him on record without shaping my discourse to please either friend or foe. Foes, I believe, he has no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>Even those who most bitterly opposed him while living, now acknowledge his great qualities, and lament his untimely end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>If enmity exist toward him in any heart, however, no answering defiance comes back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>The weapon of the good knight will never more be drawn-he has fought his last battle and yielded up his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>He sleeps now quietly, after all the turmoils of lifeafter heart-burnings and triumphs, and loves and hatreds-sleeps in the bosom of the land he loved, and toiled, and thought, and fought, and died for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>The weather, too, counts greatly for or against active service with the artillery or infantry &mdash; the winter is fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Then the wheels of the guns sink in the slushy soil; wagons cannot move with rations; and thus conquered by the rain and snow, the cannoneers and musket-bearers settle down in their comfortable camps, build their log-cabins, or their arbours of boughs; and days, and weeks, and months pass by in perfect quiet, until the spring sun dries the roads, and the thunder of artillery and musketry again roars across the fields of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> or <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>Thus the gunners and footmen bear the brunt in the great <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> battles, to retire thereafter to camp and rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>Their ranks may be decimated, but those who survive enjoy something like repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/></p> 
<p>The life of the cavalry is different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>They do not perform the hard work in the conflicts of armies, where the improved firearms of modern times would speedily destroy their horses-and horses were beyond the value of gold, almost, to the <rs>South</rs> in the recent war-nor are the losses of the cavalry in any <num value="1">one</num> engagement as great as those of the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>But the work performed by the mounted men of an army is incessant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>They fight throughout the year &mdash; in winter as in summer-when the ground is a quagmire, as when it is firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>They cannot rest, from the very nature of things, for they are the <quote>eyes and ears</quote> of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>Their duty is to watch-and to watch, the cavalier must be in the saddle with carbine ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>He must watch by night as well as day; for fright is the season of surprises, and to guard the army against surprise is the chief duty of the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>Seeing the long column falling slowly back on days of conclusive battle, the infantry are apt to sneer, and think, if they do not sayand they <hi rend="italics">say</hi> it often-<quote><hi rend="italics">We</hi> do the hard fighting, the cavalry the fancy work!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>They forget, however, <num value="1">one</num> thing &mdash; that while the infantry has been resting in camp, with regular rations and sound sleep, the cavalry have been day and night in the saddle, without rations at all, watching and fighting all along the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>Let justice be done to all; and it is not the noble infantry or artillery of the late <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName> who will be guilty of injustice to their brethren of the cavalry, who, under <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0014.00160.00912" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0011.0014.00160.00913" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Richard,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0011.0014.00160.00914" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:2"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, and the <name>Lees</name>, did that long, hard work, leaving <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> strewed with their dead bodies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>His aim was to point out the contrast which exists in the mere mode of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>The foot-soldier is confined to his camp for the greater portion of the time, and <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> sameness rather than variety, common-place rather than incident, marks his days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>As there is no rest for the cavalry-man, so there is no dull routine-no <quote>every day the same.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>His life is full of movement, variety, incident, and adventure; he is ever in the saddle, and fighting, either as a unit of the long drawn column, advancing or retiring with the army, or in scouts and skirmishes &mdash; the theatre of his work shifts quietly as do the scenes of a drama on the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>All that makes the hard and brutal trade of war endurable seems to gather around him, wreathing with brilliant flowers the keen edge of the sabre. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>is the cavalry motto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>Once in the saddle and moving, his life of quick transitions, odd experiences, and perilous or grotesque adventures, begins in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>There is a <quote>glorious uncertainty</quote> about his movements which is not without a singular charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>He is not so much a common soldier, as a gay knight-errant, knowing not where he may lay his head at the end of his day's journey-certain only that it will not be beneath the shelter of a tent, nor with any regular ration upon which to stay his hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>The infantry and artillery have wagons and rations; and theoretically the cavalry have also-but only in theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>They are never <quote>up</quote> these dilatory wagons-and as to tents, those are a luxury of which the cavalry-man seldom even dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>The blanket behind his saddle is his tent; he lies down by the bivouac fire supperless often; neither quarter-master nor commissary favours him; and when he <quote>forages</quote> for food, he is denounced as a <quote>straggler.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/></p> 
<p>But the cavalry-man accepts philosophically the uncomplimentary opinion entertained of him, in view of the certain charms of his existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>He is the child of adventure, roaming the fields and forests, and revelling in his freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>He knows whence he comes, but not whither the winds will waft him. He is never at rest; never certain what the next hour, nay, the coming moment, will bring forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>At any instant may come a surprise, an attack, the bang of carbines, the clash of sabresand then, pursuit or retreat, defeat or victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>If he falls, he <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> falls; if he survives, he sleeps serenely, wrapped up in his blanket, the root of a tree or a saddle for a pillow, overhead <quote>the canopy,</quote> all studded with the fires of night, and dreams of scenes and faces far away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>Such a life is ever fresh, and possesses never-ending attractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>To-day an exhausting march and a heavy fight-to-morrow rest, and stories, and jests, and laughter; <num value="1">one</num> day a feast of the rarest &mdash; the next a famine of the sorest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>To ride on, hour after hour, through the gloom of night, until the frame is weary unto death, and the cavalry-man totters in the saddle for very exhaustion and sleeplessness &mdash; that is not pleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>But then sleep is magical when he halts at last; food is ambrosial when he broils his chance slice of bacon on the end of a stick in the blaze of the camp-fire! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>To the cavalry-man belongs the fresh life of the forest-the wandering existence which brings back the days of old romance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>Do you wish to form some conception of the life of that model cavalry-man and gentleman, <persName n="Quixote,,Don,,," id="n0011.0014.00162.00915" reg="default:Quixote,Don,,,"><foreName>Don</foreName> <surname>Quixote</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>To do so, you have only to <quote>join the cavalry.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>Like the <rs>Don</rs>, your cavalryman goes through the land in search of adventures, and finds many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>He penetrates retired localities-odd, unknown nooksmeeting with curious characters and out-of-the-way experiences, which would make the fortune of a romance writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>Here, far away from the rushing world and the clash of arms, he finds bright faces, and is welcomed by <quote>heaven's last best gift</quote> --for woman is ever the guardian angel of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>She smiles upon him when he is gloomy; feeds him when he is hungry; and it is often the musical laughter of a girl which the cavalry-man hears as he rides on musing &mdash; not the rattle of his miserable sabre!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>Thus romance, sentiment, and poetry meet him everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>And is he fond of the grotesque?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>That meets him, too, in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>Of the pathetic?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>Ah! that salutes him often on the fierce arena of war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>Thus, living a fresh life, full of vivid emotions, he passes his days and nights, till the fatal bullet comes-laughing, fighting, feasting, starving, to the end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>His life is better than a collegiate education, for it teaches him the mysteries of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>He does not pass his days amid <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> social circles, marked by respectable uniformity and maddening common-place, but is thrown in contact with every species of <quote>moving accident,</quote> every variety of the human species; scouts, <quote>guerillas,</quote> secret agents, prisoners, night-hawks, spies, friends in blue coats, enemies in gray-all that the highways and the byways, the fields, the forests, and the day and the night contain, pass before the eyes of the cavalry-man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>He sees the adventurous life of the ranger and partisan, hears the ring of the sabre, the crack of sharpshooters, the roar of cannon, and the shouts of the squadrons as they charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>His is the existence of the rover: the sudden peril, the narrow escape, and the fun and frolic of the bivouac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>When he summons his recollections, it is not so much the <quote>great events</quote> of war as its pictures and incidents of which he discourses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>He revives its romantic scenes and gay adventures, only-remembering its smiles, sighs, laughter, tears, its gloom or sunlight, as it actually lowered or shone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>The writer of this eulogy has carried a musket, albeit he never did hard work with it; has served in the artillery, and loves it, as he honours the great arm which thundered upon every battle-field, and held the rear, all along the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, against <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0011.0014.00163.00916" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, and fired the last gun of the war at Appomatox.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>It is simply not possible that he could utter a word against those heroes of the infantry and artillery whom he is proud to call his comrades; but he remembers with most interest and pleasure the gay days when he-<quote>followed the feather</quote> of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0011.0014.00163.00917" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, that <hi rend="italics">fleur des chevaliers</hi>. In the saddle, near that good knight of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century, war became a splendid drama, rather than mere bloody work; a great stage, whereon the scenes were ever shifting, and the <quote>exits</quote> were all made to the sound of the bugle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>That sound was stirring; and recalling now his various experiences, the writer of this page hears the ring of the bugle, not the roll of the drum; remembers the life of the cavalry rather than that of the infantry or the artillery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>Some of these memories are here recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>The narratives are necessarily egotistical in appearance, since the writer was compelled to speak of what he saw in person, not by others' eyes, to give any value to his recollections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>The reader is solicited, <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> however, to regard this circumstance as unavoidable, and further to believe that a fondness for making himself conspicuous is not a trait of the writer's character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>For the rest, the pictures he has drawn are accurate, as far as his ability has enabled him to present figures and events in their real colours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>If the record is dull, it is the dulness of truth, not the stupidity of a bad romance. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>Fancy a man of low stature and athletic form, with an enormous brown beard; a huge moustache, ready to curl with laughter; a broad and lofty forehead; an eye, blue, brilliant, and penetrating as that of the eagle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>This figure was clad in a gray cavalry uniform, top-boots with small bright spurs; and on a chair lay his sabre and pistol, beside the brown felt hat looped up and adorned with a black feather. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>Around stand the staff, <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> and at the door are the laughing faces of couriers, who look on and listen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>In front of them stand the sable musicians, and the great performer of the breakdown-ebon-hued, dilapidated in costume, awaiting orders, and approaching the performance with serious and unmistakable satisfaction. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>The guitar is played by the <rs>General</rs>'s body-servant <persName><foreName>Bob</foreName></persName>, a young mulatto of dandified appearance &mdash; the air, indeed, of a lady killer --and an obvious confidence in his own abilities to delight, if not instruct and improve, his audience.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>The young lady listens and her eyes dance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>Her cheeks grow more rosy, her smiles brighter; even her elderly companion relaxes somewhat from her rigidly hostile expression, and pays attention to the music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>He leaps, he whirls, he twists and untwists his legs until the crowd at the door grows wild with admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>They had scarcely approached within pistol-shot of the head of the column, when they were fired upon, and a detachment spurred forward from the cavalry, calling upon them to halt, and firing upon them as they retreated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>They were rapidly pursued, and in a few moments the <rs>Federal</rs> <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> cavalry had thundered down upon the house, in front of which <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0017.00199.01133" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Jeb,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was standing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>The General had to act promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>There was no force within many miles of him; nothing wherewith to make resistance; flight or instant capture were the alternatives, and even flight seemed impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>The Federal horsemen had rushed at full gallop upon the house; the horses of the <rs>General</rs> and staff were unbridled, and the only means of exit from the yard seemed to be the narrow gate in front, scarcely wide enough for a mounted man to pass, and right in face of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>In addition to this, the little party had just been aroused; the <rs>General</rs> had even left his hat and cape upon the floor of the porch, so complete was the feeling of security; and when <persName n="Mosby,,,,," id="n0011.0017.00199.01134" reg="mostcommon:Mosby,Jack,,,:1"><surname>Mosby</surname></persName> was fired on, he was standing bare-headed at the gate. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>What followed all took place in an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>He was conducted across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> with the <rs>Confederate</rs> prisoners captured during the day, and soon found himself minus horse, pistol, and sabre-all of which had, of course, been taken from him &mdash; in front of a bonfire on the north bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>Around this fire a crowd of Federal cavalry-men were now assembled, discussing the events of the day, and many of them entered into conversation with the prisoners, their late adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/><rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W&mdash; was standing by the fire, no doubt reflecting upon the curious <quote>ups and downs</quote> of that curious trade called war, when all at once something familiar in the voice of a young officer of the <rs>Federal</rs> force, who was not far from him, attracted his attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>Looking at the officer closely, he recognised in him an old friend of his who had formerly resided in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>; and going up to him, the young <rs>Virginian</rs> made himself known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>He was greeted with the utmost pleasure, and the youths shook hands, laughing like boys at the odd meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>If I were a novelist instead of an historian, my dear reader, I would here <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> insert a lengthy dialogue between the friends; but not having been present, I can only give you the bare outline of W&mdash;&lsquo;s adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>From talk about old scenes, and things of the past, the conversation glided to the present, and the young <rs>Virginian</rs>'s unlucky situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>Relying upon their former friendship, the latter at once broached the subject of his escape. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/></p> 
<p>The young <rs>Virginian</rs>, nevertheless, determined to make the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>From that moment he kept a close watch on the movements of his captors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>Having eaten their supper, they now addressed themselves to the task of counting, assorting, and taking down the names of their prisioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>The latter were drawn up in a line near the fire, and a Federal officer went along the line, entering their names and regiments in his memorandum-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/><rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W-- was near the head of the line, and having given his name and regiment &mdash; the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA12">Twelfth Virginia</orgName> Cavalrysaw the officer pass on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>And he pointed to W&mdash;&lsquo;s old, discoloured cavalry jacket. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>The young man was, however, not thinking of the jokes of his captors; he was watching his opportunity to glide out of the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>It soon came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>The Federal soldiers were not looking at him; the recording officer had passed around the fire, the light of which thus shone for an instant in his eyes and dazzled him, and <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W&mdash; saw his opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>The space outside of the firelight was as gloomy as Eblis, and in a moment he had stepped from his place, and was lost in the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>He glided behind a tent, ran a few steps, and then paused to listen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>Had his movement been observed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>Would they go over the <pb id="p.222" n="222"/> count again, to verify the record?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>Then <num value="1">one</num> man would be found missing; he would be at once pursued, recaptured, and rewarded for his attempt to escape by painful or ignominious punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>He listened with all his ears; held his breath, and soon found that he was not missed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>The officer did not suspect the <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi> which had been played upon him; and the prisoners were marched off under guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/><rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W&mdash; saw them disappear with profound satisfaction, and then all his energies were bent to the hard task of getting out of the <rs>Federal</rs> camp and crossing the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>The prospect looked sufficiently dispiriting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>He was in the centre of a city of tents, where he could not stir a step without attracting attention; and even if he succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the men and the quarter-guard, the broad and deep current of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> lay still in his path &mdash; the single bridge heavily picketed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>The young man did not lose heart for a single moment, however, and, like a good soldier, determined to <quote>take the chances.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing was to conceal his identity from the men around the fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>He accordingly took off his gray jacket, and rolling it up, put it under his arm. His pantaloons were blue, and his hat was of an indefinable colour, which might be either Confederate or Federal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>In his bosom, between his shirt and naked breast, he concealed his spurs, which he had unbuckled and hidden when he was captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>Having thus prepared himself, <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W&mdash; walked boldly on, and lounged carelessly by the fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/><num value="1">One</num> of the men asked him what regiment he belonged to, as if they observed something unfamiliar in his demeanour; but his ready reply, giving the name of some Federal regiment, entirely disarmed suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>So much cavalry had taken part in the fight, and had been so much scattered, that W&mdash; was set down for <num value="1">one</num> of the many stragglers; and walking by the fires, and the quarter-guard, who stared at, but did not challenge him, he gained the bank of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2865"/>He had thus succeeded in his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> attempt; but obstacle <num value="3">number three</num> threatened to be more serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>The river before him was broad, deep, black, and cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>The bridge near by was guarded; he heard the sentinel pacing to and fro, and a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> at <pb id="p.223" n="223"/> the further extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>What was to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>Kill the sentinel by suddenly attacking and seizing his weapon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>That, under other circumstances, might have been done; but there was the other sentinel, who would at once give the alarm; then recapture, and a <quote>latter end worse than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>This plan was thus out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>But <num value="1">one</num> hope presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>The fugitive could not swim the river; but if by any means he could climb up to the floor of the bridge <hi rend="italics">inside</hi> of the sentinel, he might, perhaps, crawl along without being discovered, <quote>flank</quote> the sentinel beyond, and so get back to his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>Young, lithe, and determined, <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W&mdash; speedily made a reconnoissance of the abutments of the bridge to ascertain the possibility of executing his project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>To his great satisfaction he discovered a pipe running from a tank above to the water below &mdash; for this was the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName> bridge; and the rivets securing the pipe to the masonry afforded him an excellent foothold in climbing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>Gliding beneath the sentinel in the darkness, he crept into the shadow, grasped the pipe, and, with hands and knees, climbed foot by foot up the abutment, until he reached the edge of the floor-way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>His hands were torn and his knees lacerated, but he had taken another step toward liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>What now remained to be done was to crawl along the narrow edge of the parapet, under shadow of a species of low railing, and crossing the bridge, pass around the other sentinel in some manner, and escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>This, however, was the most doubtful, as it was certainly the most dangerous portion of the adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/>The bridge was very lofty, the ledge narrow, slippery, and unprotected for he must move outside of the railing for fear of discovery; a single false step would precipitate him into the river beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>Even if this danger were avoided, there was the sentinel beyond, and a picket, doubtless, beyond the sentinel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/><rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W &mdash; was revolving in his mind these various circumstances, and had begun to take a rather discouraging view of things, when his attention was attracted by the sound of steps coming from the direction of the <rs>Federal</rs> camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>A detachment of dismounted men were evidently approaching the bridge, and in a few moments the voice of the sentinel was heard giving the <pb id="p.224" n="224"/> challenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/><quote>Relief,</quote> was the reply; and then came, <quote>Advance relief!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>which was immediately followed by the appearance of the relief-guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>The new sentinel was relieved from his post, and took his place among the guard, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was posted, and the detachment was heard tramping across the bridge to relieve in the same manner the other sentinels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>As they came on, tramp!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>tramp! like the statue of the commander in <quote><persName n="Giovanni,,Don,,," id="n0011.0020.00224.01235" reg="default:Giovanni,Don,,,"><foreName>Don</foreName> <surname>Giovanni</surname></persName>,</quote> the young <rs>Virginian</rs> conceived.an idea as bold as it was original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>It was difficult to crawl along the narrow ledge without falling into the black gulf below, and it was questionable whether any friendly water-pipe would enable him to <quote>flank</quote> the sentinel at the opposite extremity of the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>Why not <quote>fall in</quote> in the darkness with the unsuspecting detachment, pass <hi rend="italics">through</hi> the guard beyond, and then take the chances of making his escape?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>His resolution was at once taken; and as the guard came opposite his place of concealment behind the low woodwork of the railing, he crouched lower, waited until they had passed, and then quietly stepping over a railing, fell in behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>The movement had been undiscovered; he was now advancing with measured step to <quote>assist,</quote> as the <rs>French</rs> say, at relieving the <orgName n="Old Guard" type="newspaper">Old guard</orgName> on the bridges-himself an honorary member of the relief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>His <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi> was crowned with complete success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>He passed with the detachment undiscovered to a point beyond the bridge; and then stepping from the ranks &mdash; a manoeuvre which the pitch darkness rendered by no means difficult-he concealed himself until the unsuspecting Federals disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>He then crawled on his hands and knees, crouching close to the ground by another picket which he saw upon the road, and reaching a point where he believed himself beyond range, rose to his feet and commenced moving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>All at once he saw before him another picketfire; and not knowing whether it was that of friends or enemies, he again crouched down and slowly approached the fire, crawling upon his chest along the surface of the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>He had succeeded too well up to this time to risk anything; and he accordingly continued to <quote>snake along</quote> toward the fire, in order to discover, before making himself known, whether the <pb id="p.225" n="225"/> ground around it were friends or enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>In this slow and cautious manner he approached until he was within <measure n="10yards" type="distance">ten yards</measure> of it; where, hidden behind a stump, he attentively reconnoitred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>The result was indecisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>He could not possibly succeed in discovering whether the pickets were Federal or Confederate; and in relating his adventure afterwards, <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W&mdash; declared that his heart now throbbed with greater anxiety than at any other time during the whole affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>He continued for some time thus crouching behind the stump, and his doubt was painful and protracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>At last it came to an end; he breathed freely again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/><num value="1">One</num> of the men rose from the ground, yawned, and said: <quote>I don't believe there will be a Yankee on this side of the river by the morning.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/></p> 
<p>Whereupon <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W &mdash; rose up, approached the fire, and with a laugh, made himself known, to the profound astonishment and confusion of the sleepy pickets, who had thus received a practical illustration of the ease with which an enemy might approach and send a bullet through their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>They, however, received <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> W&mdash; with military hospitality, gave him a portion of their rations, divided their blankets; and overcome with fatigue, he lay down and slept until daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>Before sunrise he was at <placeName><persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0020.00225.01236" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,James,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, and was relating his curious adventure, to the huge amusement of the laughing cavalier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>He was without horse, arms, or other clothes than those which he wore; but he was free, and he had his spurs, carried throughout against his naked breast. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>It had, indeed, become absolutely necessary to his peace of mind to come into collision with his friends across the way, and he set about devising the best plan for arriving at his object. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>The Southern cavalry to which the <rs>Major</rs> was attached, at that time occupied the county of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002155">Culpeper</placeName>, and picketed along the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>His pistol revolved at the touch, with a clear ringing click; and you could see your face in his sabre blade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>Thus accoutred, and mounted on a good, active horse, he set off from <placeName reg="Hazel, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124592">Hazel river</placeName>, and making a detour around <placeName key="tgn,2112436" n="1.000 8" reg="jeffersonton, culpeper, virginia">Jeffersonton</placeName>, came to an elevation in rear of <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> &mdash;&lsquo;s house, where he stopped to reconnoitre. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>With the <rs>Major</rs> execution followed conception rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>Pushing boldly over the crest from behind which he had made his reconnoissance, he charged across the field at a thundering gallop, whirling his burnished sabre around his head, yelling in a manner that was truly awful; and shouting as he rode to a supposititious squadron: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>As the warlike figure, surrounded by the brilliant lightning of the flashing sabre, swept on, the videttes probably saw at least a squadron of <quote>Rebel cavalry</quote> in the dust which rose behind; and hastily mounting, darted away, pursued by the triumphant <rs>Major</rs>, whose yells were now more tremendous than ever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>Across the broad field, past the house, on toward the bridge, <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> galloped the furious assailant, bent on striking terror to the enemy's hearts, and successfully completing his adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>On toward the bridge, and into the midst of the picket fled the videttes; and as the <rs>Major</rs>'s shouts, and vociferous orders to his cavalry to charge, and let no <num value="1">one</num> escape, resounded nearer, the pickets, too, mounted in hot haste, and clattered across the bridge, pursued by the <rs>Major</rs>'s pistol shots. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>In vain did the officer in charge of the picket-post shout to his men: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4136"/>If the characters of my <num value="2">two</num> friends are sufficiently indicated by the above sketch, the reader will comprehend with what pleasure they obtained permission in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> last (<dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>) to go on a romantic little scout into the lines of the enemy, beyond the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4137"/><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0011.0026.00313.01800" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> was then getting ready to cross at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and his cavalry scouted daily along the north bank of the river, up and down-so the commission of entering <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> was an exciting <num value="1">one</num>, promising no little adventure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4138"/>But to procure information of the enemy's designs was only a part of their orders &mdash; the most agreeable portion remains behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4139"/>They were directed not only to spy out the land, and the position of the foe, but also to escort a young lady, then in <placeName reg="King George, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002547">King George county</placeName>, through the enemy's lines into our own. As the reader will imagine, this was far from disagreeable to the chivalric young officers; and they made their preparations with alacrity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4140"/>Leaving their swords behind, as calculated to impede their movements when they entered the enemy's country, as they must do, on foot, they took only pistol and carbine, and set out for a point down the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4141"/>The place which they chose for crossing was <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName>, that lovely little village which nestles down prettily, like a bird, in the green fields-and here, leaving their horses at the house of a friend, they were taken across in a canoe, by a sympathizing boatman, and landed on the northern bank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4142"/>From that moment it was necessary to bring into play all the keenness and ready faculties of the woodman and the scout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4143"/><pb id="p.314" n="314"/> They were armed, as I have said, with pistol and carbine; but these were of little use against the enemy, who, if encountered at all, would outnumber and overpower them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4144"/>Their only hopes of success lay in eluding such scouting parties as they came across, and <quote>snaking it</quote> to their destination and back again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4145"/>Soon after leaving the river their adventures commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4146"/>Avoiding the roads, and making their way through the woods, they came all at once upon a large Federal camp, and passed so near it that they could hear the words uttered by the soldiers, but fortunately the darkness of the night prevented them from being seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4147"/>Leaving the camp to the right, they continued their way, walking all night, and giving a wide berth to such picket fires as they saw glimmering near their route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4148"/>They thus reached in safety the house of a lady whom <num value="1">one</num> of the party knew, and where they were certain of food and rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4149"/>These were now greatly needed by the young adventurers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4150"/>Their tramp had been exciting and prolonged, over very rough ground &mdash; they had not tasted food since the preceding day-and the whole night had been spent upon the road, or rather in the woods, without rest or sleep. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4151"/>Reaching the hospitable mansion about daybreak, they aroused the lady, and informed her, in a few words, of their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4152"/><quote>Up went the hushed amaze of hand and eye,</quote> as the <rs>English</rs> laureate says; but the worthy dame acted quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4153"/>Without stopping to parley she admitted them, closed the door, and had an excellent breakfast prepared at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4154"/>Having done full honour to the meal, the young men, worn out with fatigue and want of sleep, went to bed, and slept several hours, quite oblivious of the fact that they were far within the lines of the enemy, and subject at any moment to be <quote>caught napping.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4155"/></p> 
<p>Rising at last, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing which they did was to look around for something more to eat!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4156"/>It was ready on the table, awaiting them, and they attacked the substantial viands as if they had not eaten before for a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4157"/>Some excellent cider accompanied the solids-and this, it appeared, was a present from a young lady who, living close by, had been informed of their presence, and thus manifested her sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4158"/><pb id="p.315" n="315"/> </p> 
<p>As they rose from the table, the young lady in question entered the dining-room; and looking very attentively at <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> T &mdash; , said, smiling: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4159"/> </p> 
<p>I have your picture, sir!</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4160"/>The young man was naturally astonished at the announcement, as he had certainly never seen the young girl before; and said, with a laugh, that she must be mistaken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4161"/><quote>No, indeed I am not,</quote> was the smiling reply; <quote>are you not <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> T&mdash;?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/></p> 
<p><quote>Yes, madam.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4163"/></p> 
<p><quote>As I thought.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4164"/></p> 
<p>And the explanation followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4165"/>The young lady had a cousin who had gone to school with <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> T&mdash; , and the <num value="2">two</num> had become great friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4166"/>When they parted, they had recourse to a friendly means of remembering each other, very common with young men &mdash; they had their daguerreotypes taken together, both in the same picture, and each took <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4167"/>The young lady's cousin had presented his own to her; and thus as soon as she saw <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> T , she recognised the original of the friend of whom her cousin had often spoken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4168"/>This romantic little incident was far from putting the young adventurers in a bad humour with their enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4169"/>They tarried at the house of the hospitable dame long enough to become excellent friends with the pretty maiden, and to procure all the information which the laides could give them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4170"/>Then, as soon as the shades of evening drew on, they took up the line of march again toward their destination-passing more Federal camps, but running the gauntlet successfully between them all --and arriving safely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4171"/>Disappointment awaited them here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4172"/>The fair lady whom they came to carry off to the <quote>happy land of Dixie,</quote> was not ready to return with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4173"/>For some reason-doubtless a good <num value="1">one</num>, which I may have heard, but have now forgotten-she determined to remain where she was; and the young men, having secured valuable information of the number and positions of the enemy, set out on their return. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4174"/>They succeeded, after many adventures, in reaching the vicinity <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> of the river again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4175"/>To recross was the great difficulty-for there was no longer a sympathizing friend near at hand with a boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4176"/>In addition to this, the banks were at this point thoroughly picketed, and they were in danger of being stopped by a musket-ball if they even secured a canoe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4177"/>The attempt to cross was necessary to be made, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4178"/>It was now night, and if they were detained on the north bank of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName> until the next day, they would be in imminent danger of capture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4179"/>They accordingly set to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4180"/>Necessity, the benign mother of invention, pointed out <num value="2">two</num> logs, lying in a sort of marsh, on the edge of the stream; and these logs the young men proceeded to lash together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4181"/>Having no cords of any description, they used their suspenders, and finally succeeded in launching the impromptu raft upon the stream. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4182"/>As it floated off, they found all at once that they were moving into view of a sentinel posted upon the rising ground beyond the swampy bottom; and every moment expected to be challenged &mdash; the challenge to be succeeded by the whizzing of balls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4183"/>The enterprise terminated for the moment, differently, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4184"/>The raft had been constructed without very profound science; the suspenders gave way; and <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> T&mdash; found himself astraddle <num value="1">one</num> log, and <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> H&mdash; the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4185"/>Grand tableau!--and the aforesaid <quote>happy land of Dixie</quote> as far off as ever! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4186"/>They were forced to return to the northern bank, which they succeeded in doing with difficulty, and <quote>as wet as drowned rats.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4187"/>It was necessary to scout along the stream, to find if possible some better means of crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4188"/>This river is difficult to pass --<persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n0011.0026.00316.01801" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> was, at the same moment, engaged in the same task which absorbed the energies of the gay youths. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4189"/>Ascending the bank, and flanking the picket, they plunged into the wood, and struck down the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4190"/>They were not to be so fortunate as before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4191"/>Seeing no picket-fires for a long way ahead, they ventured into the road-but were suddenly startled by the tramp of cavalry coming toward them from below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4192"/><pb id="p.317" n="317"/> </p> 
<p>They leaped the ditch and brushwood fence, and were about to scud across the field, when the troop was upon them, and discovered the moving figures in the dim starlight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4193"/><quote>Halt!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4194"/>came from the officer in command, as he drew up; and seeing that their further progress would be arrested by a shower of carbine balls, the young men threw themselves upon the ground close beside the brush fence, trusting to the darkness to hide them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4195"/><quote>I certainly saw men there,</quote> said the officer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4196"/><quote>I don't think it was anything but cows,</quote> said another voice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4197"/><quote>Send a man to see.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4198"/></p> 
<p>And a trooper pushed across into the field, and rode up to the truants, who, finding themselves discovered, put the best face upon the matter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4199"/>They were conducted to the officer in command, who said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4204"/>We are now looking for the camp.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4205"/></p> 
<p>This was uttered in the most plausible manner imaginable, and as the darkness hid the young man's Confederate uniform, there was nothing suspicious about him to the eyes of the officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4206"/>The <num value="2">two</num> youths seemed to be what they represented themselves-stragglers or sick, trying to rejoin their companiesand no doubts appeared to rest upon the <rs>Federal Captain</rs>'s mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4207"/>He reprimanded them for dodging about, and proceeded on his way-taking the precaution, however, of a good officer, of leaving a mounted man in charge of them, with orders to conduct them to the camp of the regiment to which he belonged, about half a mile distant, and report to the <rs>Colonel</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4208"/>The troop was soon out of sight, and the cavalry-man and his prisoners proceeded slowly in the same direction; their conductor holding a cocked pistol in his right hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4209"/><pb id="p.318" n="318"/> </p> 
<p>The young men exchanged glances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>Now or never was their opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4211"/>In fact, something more than loss of liberty was involved in their capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4212"/>They had represented themselves as members of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3INCav">Third Indiana Cavalry</orgName>; were within the <rs>Federal</rs> lines; they were clearly reducible under the head of <hi rend="italics">spies</hi>; and in that character would have a short shrift and a stout rope for their pains. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4213"/>The camp was near, the time short, action was necessary. </p>

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4221"/>It was quickly discharged, and again, and again; but strange to say, not a single ball took effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4222"/><rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> H-- retreated, and the trooper turned round and rode at <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> T&mdash; , who was armed with a carbine which he had borrowed from me for the expedition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4223"/>As the trooper rode at him, he raised the weapon, took aim, and fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4224"/>In narrating this portion of his adventures, the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> says: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4226"/>To continue my narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4227"/>The situation of the youths was more critical than ever after the <quote>suppression</quote> of the trooper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4228"/>The company of cavalry were not far off; the firing had certainly been heard, and a detachment would speedily be sent back to inquire what had occasioned it, even if the riderless horse did not announce fully all that had taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4229"/>No time <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> was to be lost, and the adventurous youths leaped the brush fence, ran across the field, and took shelter in a pine thicket, through which they continued to advance as before, down the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4230"/>They did not observe any signs of pursuit, and after a weary march, reached the vicinity of <placeName reg="Port Conway, King George, Virginia" key="tgn,2593837">Port Conway</placeName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>I travelled in a light <orgName type="regiment" key="1Cav">one-horse</orgName> vehicle, an unusual mode of conveyance for a soldier, but adopted for the convenience it afforded me in transporting my blankets, clothes, sword, and other personal effects, which would certainly have sunk a horseman fathoms deep in the terrible mud of the region, there to remain like the petrified <name>Roman</name> sentinel dug out from <placeName reg="Centreville, Louisa, Virginia" key="tgn,2230916">Pompeii</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>Lonely cavalrymen appeared and disappeared; scrutinizing eyes reconnoitred the suspicious vehicle as it passed; noises of stamping horses were heard in the depths of the thicket.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>Mile after mile was thus traversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>Still the interminable road through the pines stretched on and on. Its terminus seemed as distant as the crack of doom. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>The <rs type="place">Warrenton turnpike</rs> did not appear, though I knew it was but a mile or <num value="2">two</num> through to it. Where was it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4459"/>From several slight indications, it was obvious that the courier had just returned after carrying a dispatch, and that he experienced to its fullest extent the grateful sensation of having performed all the duty that could be expected of him, and regarded himself as legally and equitably entitled to at least <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure> sleep, in the fond embrace of his white blanket. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4486"/></p> 
<p>I had gone round <num value="2">two</num> sides of a triangle and was quietly advancing as I might have done over the same route! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4487"/>There was this disagreeable difference, however, that the night was now dark; that the pickets were numerous and on the alert; that neither I nor the courier knew the precise point to turn off; and that <persName n="Wheat,,,,," id="n0011.0027.00331.01844" reg="mostcommon:Wheat,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheat</surname></persName>'s <quote>Tigers,</quote> then on picket, had an eccentric idea that everybody stirring late at night, at such a time, was a <hi rend="italics">Yankee</hi>, and to be fired upon instantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4488"/>This had occurred more than once &mdash; they had shot at couriers-and as they had no fires you never knew when a picket was near. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4489"/>This was interesting, but not agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4490"/>To have a friendly <quote>Tiger</quote> regret the mistake and be sorry for killing you is something, but not affecting seriously the general result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4491"/>Such appeared to be the view taken by my friend the courier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4492"/>He was in a tremendous state of excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4493"/>I was not composed myself; but my disquiet was connected with the idea of supper, which I feared would be over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4494"/>A day's fasting had made me ravenous, and I hurried my driver constantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4495"/>This proceeding filled my friend the courier with dire forebodings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4496"/>He several times rode back from his place some <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> in advance to beg me pathetically to drive slower-he could not hear the challenge if I drove so fast, and <quote>they would shoot!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4497"/>This view I treated with scorn, and the result was, that my guide was nearly beside himself with terror. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4498"/>He besought me to be prudent; but as his idea of prudence <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> was to walk slowly along listening with outstretched neck and eager ears for the challenge of the pickets from the shadow of the huge trees, and to shout out the countersign immediately upon being halted, with a stentorian voice which could be heard half a mile; as his further views connected with the proprieties of the occasion seemed to impel him to hold long and confidential conversations with the <quote>Tigers,</quote> to the effect that he and I were, in the fullest sense of the term, <quote>all right;</quote> that I was Aide to <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0027.00332.01845" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>; that I had come that day from <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>; that I had lost my way; that I was not a suspicious character; that <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was in charge of me &mdash; as this method of proceeding, I say, seemed to constitute the <hi rend="italics">prudence</hi> which he urged upon me so eloquently, I treated his remonstrances and arguments with rude and hungry disregard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4499"/>Instead of waiting quietly while he palavered with the sentinels, I broke the dialogue by the rough and impolite words to the sentinel: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>When I left home, my dear boys, I promised to write to you whenever an opportunity occurred, and give you some of my views and opinions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>I have an opportunity to-morrow to send you this; and as the characters of great men are valuable guides to growing boys who are shaping their own, I will take this occasion to tell you something about the famous <rs>Commander</rs> of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00353.01950" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>I will <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> describe his appearance; for I have always observed that when we know how a great man looks, we take far more interest in his sayings and doings, for we have an accurate idea of the sort of person who is talking or acting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>I remember reading once that <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00353.01951" reg="nearbymention:Caesar,Augustus,,,"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>, the celebrated Roman General, was a dandy in his youth &mdash; a sort of <quote>fine gentleman</quote> about <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>; and had lost all his hair, which he regretted greatly, and tried to conceal with the laurel crown he wore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>Also, that when he conquered <persName n="Gaul,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00353.01952" reg="mostcommon:Gaul,nomatch:0"><surname>Gaul</surname></persName> he was thin and pale, had frequent fainting fits, and yet was so resolute and determined that while he was riding on horseback, over mountains and through rivers, he would dictate dispatches to as many as <num value="7">seven</num> secretaries at a time, who were carried in litters at his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>I also remember reading how the <rs>Emperor</rs> <pb id="p.354" n="354"/> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00354.01953" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> looked, and all about his old gray overcoat, his cocked hat, his habit of taking snuff from his waistcoat pocket, and his dark eyes, set in the swarthy face, and looking at you so keenly as he spoke to you. I was greatly helped, too, in my idea of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00354.01954" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>-whom <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00354.01955" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, to my thinking, greatly resembles-by finding that he was tall, muscular, and carried his head erect, repulsing with a simple look all meddling or impertinence, and impressing upon all around him, by his grave and noble manner, a conviction of the lofty elements of his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>Knowing these facts about <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00354.01956" reg="nearbymention:Caesar,Augustus,,,"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00354.01957" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName>, I noticed that I had a much better understanding of their careers, and indeed seemed to see them when they performed any celebrated action which was related in their biographies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00354.01958" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is now so justly famous that, although posterity will be sure to find out all about him, my grandchildren (if I have any) will be glad to hear how he appeared to the eyes of <persName n="Shabrach,Corporal,,,," id="n0011.0030.00354.01959" reg="nearbymention:Shabrach,Solomon,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Shabrach</surname></persName>, their grandfather, <num value="1">one</num> of the humble soldiers of his army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>I have seen the <rs>General</rs> frequently, and he once spoke to me, so I can describe him accurately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>He has passed middle age, and his hair is of an iron gray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>He wears a beard and moustache, which are also gray, and give him a highly venerable appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>He has been, and still is, an unusually handsome man, and would attract attention in a crowd from his face alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>Exposure to sun and wind has made his complexion of a ruddy, healthy tint, and from beneath his black felt hat a pair of eyes look at you with a clear, honest intentness, which gives you thorough confidence both in the ability and truthfulness of their owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>I have always observed that you can tell the character of a man by his eyes, and I would be willing to stake my farm and all I am worth upon the statement that there never was a person with such eyes as <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00354.01960" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s who was not an honest man. As to his stature, it is tall, and his body is well knit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>You would say he was strong and could bear much fatigue, without being heavy or robust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>His bearing is erect, and when his head bends forward, as it sometimes does, it appears to stoop under the weight of some <pb id="p.355" n="355"/> great scheme he is concocting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>His dress is very simple, consisting generally of an old gray coat, dark-blue pantaloons, a riding cape of the same colour; boots worn outside, and a black hat. Sometimes a large dark overcoat is worn over all. He seldom carries a sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/>He rides fine horses, and is my model of an old Virginia Cavalier, who would rather be torn to pieces by shell and canister than give up any of his rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4885"/>If I was asked to describe <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00355.01961" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s ordinary appearance and attitude, either in the saddle, in front of the line-of-battle, or standing with his field-glass in his hand, reconnoitring the enemy keenly from beneath the gray eyebrows, I should say, in words I have met with in some book, that his attitude was <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend="italics">supreme invincible repose</hi>. Here you see a man whom no anxieties can flurry, no reverses dismay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>I have seen him thus a dozen times, on important occasions; and that, if nothing else, convinces me that he is, in the foundations of his character, a very great man. No man in public affairs now, to my thinking at least, is so fine a representative and so truthful a type of the great <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> race of old times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>As to his character, everybody has had an opportunity of forming an opinion upon the subject-at least of his <hi rend="italics">military</hi> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>Some persons, I know-<persName n="Quattlebum,Captain,,,," id="n0011.0030.00355.01962" reg="mostcommon:Quattlebum,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Quattlebum</surname></persName> for instance, who is a man of no great brains himself, however, confidentially speaking-say that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00355.01963" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> is not a great general, and compares him to <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00355.01964" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, who, they say, won greater victories, and followed them up to better results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>Such comparisons, to my thinking, are foolish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>I am no great scholar, but I have read enough about <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s times to know that they were very different from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00355.01965" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s. He, I mean <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00355.01966" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, was at the head of a French army, completely disciplined, and bent on <quote>glory.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>They wanted their general to fight on every occasion, and win more <quote>glory.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>If he didn't go on winning <quote>glory</quote> he was not the man for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>The consequence was that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00355.01967" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, who was quite as fond of <quote>glory</quote> as his men, fought battles whenever he could get at the enemy, and as his armies were thoroughly disciplined, with splendid equipments, and plenty of provisions and ammunition, he was able to follow up <pb id="p.356" n="356"/> his successes, as he did at <placeName reg="Marengo, Iowa, Iowa" key="tgn,2035190">Marengo</placeName> and <placeName reg="Austerlitz, Lucas, Ohio" key="tgn,2140495">Austerlitz</placeName>, and get the full benefit of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00356.01968" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> is in a very different situation from <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00356.01969" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>This is an army of volunteers, who did not come into the field to gain <quote>glory,</quote> but to keep the <rs>Yankees</rs> from coming further South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>They have no disposition to rebel and get rid of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00356.01970" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> if he does not feed them on a dish of <quote>glory</quote> every few weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4897"/>They are not as well organized as they ought to be, and are badly equipped, provisioned, and ammunitioned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4898"/>With such an army it is unreasonable to expect <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00356.01971" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to fight as often and as desperately as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00356.01972" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> did, or to follow up his victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4899"/>He takes the view, I suppose, that he is <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in the field; that <quote>glory</quote> is a secondary matter; that worrying out the enemy is the best tactics for us, with our smaller number and superior material; and that no risks ought to be run with our army, which, once destroyed by an unlucky step, could not be replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>Altogether, for the reasons stated above, I think <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00356.01973" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is a better soldier for the place he occupies than <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00356.01974" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> would be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>I can look back to many occasions where I think a different course from that which he pursued would have been better, but I do not, on that account, mean to say that he was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>I think he was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/>My dear boys, there is no man so wise as he who explains what ought to have been done, <hi rend="italics">after the event</hi>. It is like the progress of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>A child, in the year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, knows <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> things that the wisest philosopher of <dateStruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></dateStruct> knew nothing about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>So a boy may be able to understand that this or that would have been better, from what he now knows, when our wisest generals, from want of information at the time, could not. It is a solemn thing to be in command of an army which cannot be renewed, if once destroyed; especially when that army is the only breakwater against the torrent attempting to sweep us away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>I have, on all occasions, expressed these opinions of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00356.01975" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and I intend to go on expressing them, with many others like them, and if anybody thinks I do so from interested motives they are welcome to their opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>It is not likely that the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> <pb id="p.357" n="357"/> will ever know whether <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num> <persName n="Shabrach,Corporal,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01976" reg="nearbymention:Shabrach,Solomon,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Shabrach</surname></persName> likes or dislikes him-whether he admires him, or the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>I am glad of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>I consider myself just as good as <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01977" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> as long as I am honest and a good soldier, doing my duty to the country in the upright, brave, and independent attitude of a free Virginian; and let me tell you that the <rs>General</rs> would be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to acknowledge it. My dear boys, there is nobody so simple and unassuming as a gentleman, and I tell you again that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01978" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is not only a gentleman, but a great man, and <persName n="Shabrach,Corporal,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01979" reg="nearbymention:Shabrach,Solomon,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Shabrach</surname></persName> takes off his hat and salutes him, whether noticed by the <rs>General</rs> or not. It is his duty to salute him, and he performs that duty without expecting to be promoted to <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> Corporal for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>I will therefore say of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01980" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> that, to my thinking, his character bears the most striking and surprising resemblance to that of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01981" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>When I say this, you will know my opinion of him, for I have always taught my boys to revere the name of the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>In saying this about <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01982" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, I do not mean any empty compliment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>It is very easy to talk about a <quote><num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></quote> without meaning much, but I mean what I say. I read <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01983" reg="mostcommon:Marshall,nomatch:0"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName>'s Life of the <rs>General</rs> some years since, and I remember taking notice of the fact that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01984" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> appeared to be the tallest and strongest of all the great men around him. I did not see that he excelled <hi rend="italics">each <num value="1">one</num></hi> of them in <hi rend="italics">every particular</hi>. On the contrary, there was <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>; he could make a better speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/>There was <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01985" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>; he could write a better <quote>State paper.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>And there was <persName n="Hamilton,,Alexander,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01986" reg="default:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, who was a much better hand at figures, and the hocus-pocus of currency and <quote>finance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>(I wish we had him now, if we could make him a <hi rend="italics">States' Rights</hi> man.) But <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01987" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, to my thinking, was a much greater man than <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName>, or <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01988" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00357.01989" reg="nearbymention:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>He was <hi rend="italics">wiser</hi>. In the balance and harmony of his faculties he excelled them all, and when it came to his <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> nature they were nowhere at all!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>In reading his life, I remember thinking that he was the <hi rend="italics">fairest</hi> man I ever heard of. His very soul seemed to revolt against injustice to the meanest creature that crawled; and he appeared to be too proud to <pb id="p.358" n="358"/> use the power he wielded to crush those who had made him their enemy by their own wrong-doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>Although he was a man of violent temper, he had it under perfect control, and he seems to have gone through life with the view of having carved on his tombstone: <quote>Here lies a man who never did intentional injustice to a human creature.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>Now anybody that knows <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00358.01990" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> knows that this is just like <hi rend="italics">him</hi>. For my part, I am just as sure as I can be of anything, that if <num value="1">one</num> of his <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs> tried to oppress the humble <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num> <persName n="Shabrach,Corporal,,,," id="n0011.0030.00358.01991" reg="nearbymention:Shabrach,Solomon,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Shabrach</surname></persName>, he would put the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> under arrest, and make him answer for his despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>If you will look at the way <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00358.01992" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> fought, also, you will find a great resemblance to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00358.01993" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>The enemy had then, as now, to be worried out &mdash; to be evaded by falling back when the ammunition or rations gave out &mdash; to be harassed by partisans, and defeated at <num value="1">one</num> point to balance their success at another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>The account current was cast up at the end of each year, the balance struck, and preparations made to open a new account for the next year, and the next! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>That's the way we are fighting this war, and that is <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00358.01994" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s plan, I think, as it was <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>'s. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>All this army has pretty much the same opinion of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00358.01995" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> that I have, and is glad that it is commanded by <num value="1">one</num> whom it both respects and loves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>There is not doubt about the <rs>General</rs>'s popularity with the army, and its confidence in him. The men call him <quote><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>,</quote> and are proud of his notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>I told you that he once spoke to your father, who is nothing but <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num> Corporal, and you will be proud when I tell you that little <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>'s letter, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he ever wrote me, was the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>I was sitting on a stump by the roadside reading it with a delight that showed itself, I suppose, in my countenance, when, hearing horses' hoofs near me, I raised my head and saw <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0030.00358.01996" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, in his old riding-cape, with several members of his staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>I rose quickly to my feet and made the military salute-<num value="2">two</num> fingers to the hat-when what was my surprise to see the <rs>General</rs> stop with all his staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>His hand went to his hat in return for my salute, and looking at me with his clear eyes, he said in a grave, friendly voice: <pb id="p.359" n="359"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>When you come out of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, my dear boys, you have to get a passport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>As you have never yet travelled from home, I will explain what a passport is. It is a paper (always brown) which is signed by somebody or his clerk, and which induces a melancholy-looking soldier at the cars, with a musket and fixed bayonet, to let you go back from the horrors of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to the delights of camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>As without this brown paper (for unless the paper is brown the passport is not good) you cannot get back home &mdash; that is to camp, the soldier's home &mdash; there is, of course, a great crowd of applicants always at the office where the papers are delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>I was recently in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, having been sent there on business connected with the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName> of our regiment, and I will describe for your instruction the passport office, and the way you get a passport. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>I thought at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I would not need <num value="1">one</num>, because my orders were approved by several high officers, and last by <persName n="Taylor,Major,,,," id="n0011.0030.00360.02004" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> of the army, <quote>by command of General <pb id="p.361" n="361"/> <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0030.00361.02005" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:44"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>,</quote> and nobody had demanded any other evidence of my right to travel before I reached <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/></p> 
<p>This appeared to be such a good joke that I began to laugh, at which the sentinel looked very much astonished, and evidently had his doubts of my sanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>I went back and at once looked up the <quote>passport office.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>I found that it was in a long wooden building, on a broad street, in the upper part of the city, and when I reached the place I found a large crowd assembled at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>This door was about <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> wide, and <num value="1">one</num> at a time only could enter &mdash; the way being barred by a fiercelooking sentinel who kept his musket with fixed bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>I observed that everything was <quote>fixed bayonet</quote> in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, directly across the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>This ferocious individual let in <num value="1">one</num> at a time, and as each <num value="1">one</num> entered the crowd behind him, which was as tightly packed together as a parcel of herrings in a barrel, surged forward with a sort of rush, only to be driven back by the sentinel, who scowled at them pretty much as a farmer does at a parcel of lazy negroes who have neglected their work <pb id="p.362" n="362"/> and incurred the penalty of the lash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>As fast as the passports were granted, those who got them passed out at another door; a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> sentinel, with musket and fixed bayonet also, bade defiance to the crowd. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>Well, after working my way through the mass, and remaining jammed in it for over an hour, my turn came, and with a slow and reluctant motion, the sentinel, who had been eyeing me for some time with a sullen and insolent look, raised his musket and allowed me to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>His eye continued to be fixed on me, as if I had come to pick some <num value="1">one</num>'s pocket, but I did not heed him, my curiosity being too much excited by the scene before me. A row of applicants were separated from a row of clerks in black coats, by a tall railing with a sort of counter on top, and the clerks were <hi rend="italics">bullying</hi> the applicants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>That is the only word I can use to describe it. I am not mistaken about this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>Here were very respectable looking citizens, officers of the army, fine looking private soldiers, and all were being <hi rend="italics">bullied</hi>. <quote>Why do they bully people at the passport office?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>you will probably ask, boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>I don't know, but I have always observed that small <quote>official</quote> people always treat the world at large with a sort of air of defiance, as if <quote>outsiders</quote> had no right to be coming there to demand anything of them; and the strange thing is, that everybody submits to it as a matter of course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>Well, there were a large number of persons who wanted passports, and only a few clerks were ready to wait on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>A considerable number of well dressed young men who would make excellent privates &mdash; they were so stout and well fed-sat around the warm stove reading newspapers and chatting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4982"/>I wondered that they did not help, but was afterwards informed that this was not <quote>their hour,</quote> and they had nothing to do with the establishment until <quote>their hour</quote> arrived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>At last my turn came round, and I presented my orders to a clerk, who looked <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at the paper, then at me, pretty much as a cashier in a bank would do if he suspected that a draft presented to him was a forgery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5554"/>Well, I got the men, all good fellows for that sort of work, and we set out about <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> at night on our expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5555"/>The night was very dark, and you could not see the road before you; but I knew every foot of the ground, and had no difficulty on that score.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5556"/>We stopped at a house on the way, where we found <num value="2">two</num> negroes; but they could give me no information, and I pushed on in silence toward <placeName reg="Upton's house">Upton's house</placeName>, where the <rs>Yankee</rs> picket was always stationed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5557"/>Just in front of the house there is a tree, you may have noticed, which we could see easily from <placeName reg="Taylors Hill, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2713343">Taylor's Hill</placeName>, where our picket was &mdash; about <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure> off-and the men used to fire at each other, though I never did, as it was too far. Now I knew that if the enemy occupied the hill that night, their picket would be at this tree; and I accordingly made a circuit and crept up toward it, to reconnoitre, leaving the men a short distance behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5558"/>I got near the tree, which I could see indistinctly, but observed nothing in the shape of a picket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5559"/>To find if any was really there, I picked up a stone to throw at a fence; for I knew if there were any <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> there, that as soon as they heard it strike, they would jump up and exclaim, <quote>Hello!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5560"/>didn't you hear something, <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, or <persName n="Dick,,,,," id="n0011.0034.00400.02141" reg="mostcommon:Dick,nomatch:0"><surname>Dick</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5561"/>What was that?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5562"/>They would <pb id="p.401" n="401"/> naturally be startled, and would in some manner betray their presence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5563"/>Well, I threw the stone, and it struck the fence, bouncing off and making a tremendous noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5564"/>There was no reply; the silence remained entirely unbroken, and I was satisfied that there was no picket at that particular spot, at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5565"/>I therefore advanced boldly, and reached the tree, making a signal to the men to come up. The enemy had evidently been at the spot only a short time before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5566"/>There were the remains of a picket fire, and a quantity of green corn lying about, taken from the field before the house, which was about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> off, and on the tree was hanging a canteen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5567"/>I took it and put it on, and then cautiously approached the house, supposing that the <rs>Yankee</rs> pickets had gone in to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5568"/><persName n="Upton,,,,," id="n0011.0034.00401.02142" reg="mostcommon:Upton,nomatch:0"><surname>Upton</surname></persName> was then in the <rs>Yankee Congress</rs>, and his house was vacant, and I supposed the enemy used it as a place of shelter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5569"/>I walked noiselessly around the house, but could see no sign of any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5570"/>I thought I would try the same game as before, and found a stone, which I threw against the side of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5571"/>Bang! it went, but no <num value="1">one</num> replied; and I was then pretty sure that I had everything in my own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5572"/>We knocked at the door, and a sleepy voice said something-probably a negro's-but we could not get in, though we tried to prise the door open. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5573"/>I had thus got possession of the hill, and the next thing was to hold it. I reflected for a moment, and then sent <num value="2">two</num> of the men back to <persName n="Simpson,Captain,,,," id="n0011.0034.00401.02143" reg="mostcommon:Simpson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Simpson</surname></persName>, with a message to the effect that I had obtained possession of the place without resistance, and that if he would send me <num value="15">fifteen</num> men, I would stay there, engaging the enemy if they tried to recapture it. The men started off, but lost their way in the darkness &mdash; they were some of those town boys not used to scouting-and only <num value="1">one</num> arrived at last; the other went away round the whole line of the enemy, but got back safely next day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5574"/>I was thus left with only <num value="2">two</num> men; and <num value="1">one</num> of these I posted as a vedette at the house, while I returned with the other, whose name was <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0034.00401.02144" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, to the tree by the gate, where the picket fire had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5575"/><pb id="p.402" n="402"/> </p> 
<p>It was now near day, and I began to be very anxious for the appearance of the <num value="15">fifteen</num> men. The messengers had had abundance of time to go and return, but no men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5576"/>I knew the programme of the enemy now perfectly well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>They were very nervous at that time, and were always afraid of being <quote>cut off,</quote> as they called it, and every night would leave their place on the hill, retiring to the woods down in the rear to prevent being <quote>cut off</quote> by scouting parties in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5578"/>When day returned, they would resume their position at the picket tree. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5579"/>I knew, therefore, that everything depended upon getting my reinforcement promptly, or it would be too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5580"/>I could not hold the hill with <num value="1">one</num> man against them all, and I didn't like the thought of slinking off as I came, and making nothing by the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5581"/>So I listened anxiously for sounds from the direction of <placeName reg="Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia" key="tgn,2111722">Falls Church</placeName>, expecting every moment to hear the footsteps of the men. I could hear nothing, however, and for the reason I have given &mdash; that my messenger arrived so late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5582"/><persName n="Simpson,Captain,,,," id="n0011.0034.00402.02145" reg="mostcommon:Simpson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Simpson</surname></persName>, as he told me afterwards, promptly ordered out the detail I asked for; but they did not arrive in time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5583"/>All this time I was listening attentively in the opposite direction, too. I knew that if <hi rend="italics">my</hi> men did not come, the enemy <hi rend="italics">would</hi> at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> streak of daylight, and I did not wish to be caught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5584"/>I determined to <quote>fire and fall back,</quote> if I could not fight them-and the night was so still that I could hear the slightest sound made by a man before he approached me. My plan had been all arranged, counting on the arrival of the <num value="15">fifteen</num> men, and it was to place them in a cut of the road near the house-and as the enemy came up, make the men rest their guns on the bank, and pour a sudden fire into the flank of the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5585"/>I knew this would rout them completely-and everything was arranged to carry out the plan-but, as I said, the men did not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5586"/>If I held the hill I would have to do so with <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num></hi> instead of <hi rend="italics"><num value="15">fifteen</num>.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5587"/>Everything turned out as I expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5588"/>Just at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blush of day, while everything was yet hazy and indistinct, I heard the enemy-tramp!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5589"/>tramp! tramp!-coming up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5590"/>The man watching the house was <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> off; and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0034.00402.02146" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and myself were, as I have said, at the gate near the tree, hid in the <pb id="p.403" n="403"/> tall corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5591"/>He was armed with a Minie musket, and I had the same weapon, with a <num value="6">six</num>-shooter besides. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5592"/>I leaned on the fence, crouching down and listening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5593"/>The tramp of the <rs>Yankees</rs> came nearer, and, in the dim light, I could see a company of them, with an officer at their head, approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5594"/>When they were about <measure n="10yards" type="distance">ten yards</measure> off, and I could make them out perfectly distinct, I whispered, <quote>Now, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0034.00403.02147" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5595"/>and, resting my gun on the fence, I took deliberate aim at the officer, and fired, striking him in the breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5596"/>I then dropped my gun, and poured into them the fire of all the barrels of my revolver, killing a Sergeant, and wounding <num value="3">three</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5597"/>Although badly wounded, the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> in command stood gallantly, and shouted to the men, who had for the most part broken, and were running: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5598"/> <quote>Halt there!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5599"/>Fire on the scoundrels!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5600"/>Halt, I say!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5601"/>Fire on them!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5602"/></p> 
<p>Some of them turned, and I heard the click of the locks as the guns were cocked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5603"/> <quote>Look out, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0034.00403.02148" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5604"/>I whispered, and I crouched down behind the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5605"/>At the same moment a hot volley came tearing through the tall corn, and cutting the blades over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5606"/>I knew it would not do to let them discover that there were only <num value="2">two</num> men in front; so, having no more loads in my pistol, I thundered out as though addressing a company who had fired without orders: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5610"/>Steady! Dress to the right!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5611"/></p> 
<p>This completely took them in, and made them believe that they were ambushed by a large force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5612"/>In spite of all the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> could do, they broke and ran down the hill, leaving <num value="1">one</num> man &mdash; the Sergeant-dead behind them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5613"/>The <rs>Lieutenant</rs> was carried off by some of the men, and taken to a house not far from the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5614"/>I was there soon afterwards, and they told me he was shot in the left breast, just above the heart, and died of the wound. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5717"/>Well, I took <num value="2">two</num> men and went scouting down that way, and came to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gate.

<p>He hesitated for a moment, but finally lowered his pistol, and said he would not have surrendered to <num value="1">one</num> man if I had not taken him <hi rend="italics">at a disadvantage</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5755"/>Let me here again, in justice to the <rs>Captain</rs>, guard the reader from supposing that these relations were volunteered by the hero of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5756"/>Such was by no means the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5757"/>It was only after skilful manoeuvring and repeated urging that the worthy was inducedwith many preliminary protests, accompanied by a determined twisting of his mustache &mdash; to enter on the subject of his adventures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5758"/>This explanation is due to him. Nothing is more perilous than what is called egotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5759"/>When a man sits down to narrate his own performances, or when he relates them orally to a circle of listeners, the instinctive feeling of the reader or the listener is prone to be <num value="1">one</num> of doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5760"/>Human nature is so curiously constituted that whatever even <hi rend="italics">appears</hi> egotistical is offensive; and the revenge which men take for being silenced or eclipsed, is to question the truth of what the egotist utters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5767"/>Instead of being an egotist, and an incessant talker, he is really the most retiring and silent of men. You may be with him for a month, and during the whole of that time he will not once refer to any event of his experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5768"/>He will talk with you quietly, upon this or that subject, but never about his own exploits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5769"/>I cannot too often repeat, in justice to the <rs>Captain</rs>, that the narratives here given were extracted from him by the process of direct interrogation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5770"/>Having the present highly praiseworthy end in view &mdash; that of putting upon record some singular chapters of the war &mdash; I attacked him, and drew forth his recollections, as water is drawn from a well, by working at the windlass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5975"/>If you have a clear idea of this, you will understand what took place easily. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5977"/>He was anxious to keep up thorough communications with the other column, however, and as I was familiar with every part of that country, he sent me with <persName n="Conner,Captain,,,," id="n0011.0034.00423.02242" reg="mostcommon:Conner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Conner</surname></persName>, of the <name>Jeff</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5979"/>Well, I proceeded with <persName n="Conner,Captain,,,," id="n0011.0034.00423.02243" reg="mostcommon:Conner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Conner</surname></persName> along the sort of bridle path which was the lowest down of the <num value="2">two</num> which I have mentioned, as connecting the main roads, keeping a keen look-out for the enemy, who, I was pretty sure, were all around us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5980"/>About half way we met a countryman who was leading a cow by the horns, and he told us that a party of the enemy's cavalry had just passed along the other cross road above toward the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5981"/>It occurred to me at once that our men on the <placeName reg="Telegraph, Grant, New Mexico" key="tgn,2714060">Telegraph</placeName> road had fallen back more rapidly than the other column, and unmasked the mouth of the upper cross road, which the enemy had then struck into, intending to get into the <rs>Williamsburg</rs> <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> road and cut the <rs>General</rs> off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5987"/>He agreed; and I got off my horse, threw the bridle over a stump, and crept through the pine brush until I was within <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6001"/>As they came within about <measure n="15yards" type="distance">fifteen yards</measure>, I levelled my carbine at the officer in front, and pulled trigger; but the cursed thing snapped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6002"/>I had been skirmishing all day, and it had got dirty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6003"/>I fired my pistol into them, however, and the <rs>Federal Cavalry</rs> halted, both sides sitting in the saddle and banging away with carbines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6004"/>Our men had the better of it, though, as the <rs>Yankees</rs> had their sabres drawn, and we got the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire on them, killing several of them, I saw in the road afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6005"/>I <measure n="3" type="wounded">wounded three</measure> or <num value="4">four</num> myself, and was still popping at them when they concluded to give it up, and go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6006"/>They turned round, and I ran out, looking for a good horse, as several were running about without riders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6007"/>I got a good <num value="1">one</num>, but found he was wounded, and just then I saw a splendid black stallion, who took my eye wonderfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6008"/>I tried to catch him-walking up and helloing <quote>woe!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6009"/>to him-but whenever I got near, he trotted off, and I missed him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6010"/>I caught him at last, <pb id="p.426" n="426"/> mounted him, and started back toward the scene of the skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6011"/>I remember feeling in fine spirits, and looking down at my splendid stallion, who was full of fire and spirit &mdash; a big black fellow, the very horse I wanted-admiring his neck and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6012"/>I was still examining him, with my head down, as we went on at full speed toward the spot where I expected to find <persName n="Goode,Colonel,,,," id="n0011.0034.00426.02250" reg="mostcommon:Goode,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Goode</surname></persName>, when suddenly I heard a quick <quote>Halt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6014"/><quote>Here's <num value="1">one</num> of 'em!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>in front; and a carbine ball whizzed by me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>They had got reinforcements, and brought up artillery to plant in the road-and I had run right into them! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6017"/>There was only <num value="1">one</num> thing for me to do, and that was to get away from there as fast as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6018"/>I accordingly wheeled round and went back over the same road I had come, followed by a dozen men, shouting <quote>halt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6019"/>halt! halt!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6020"/>and firing at me. I leaned over on my horse, and could hear the balls whizzing by me every <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>--I afterwards found the accoutrements, especially the thick bundle behind the saddle, full of bullet holes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6021"/>I would have got away from them, but all at once my horse threw up his head &mdash; a ball had passed clean through it. He still kept on, however,--horses will go long with that sort of wound-but another bullet struck him right behind my leg, on the left side, and I felt him staggering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6022"/>The party saw this, and set up a whoop, which was rather too near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6023"/>I saw that they would catch me, if I depended on my horse, so I threw myself off and ran down a little path in the bushes, by the side of the road, and did not stop until I was well concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6024"/>They fired at me and around several times, but as they were afraid of coming on our infantry, they gave it up, and rode away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6025"/>As soon as they were gone I came out of the bushes, and went to my horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6026"/>He had fallen in the road, and I took from him several articles strapped to the saddle, and left him to die. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6027"/>I knew now that the <rs>General</rs> would retire by the <placeName reg="Beach, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110561">Beach</placeName> road, the only <num value="1">one</num> left, and I determined to strike across and join him, trusting to luck to get a horse somewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6028"/>I accordingly set out in that direction, trusting to my skill to flank the enemy's pickets, <pb id="p.427" n="427"/> which I knew I could do, and get through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6029"/>My only fear was that I would be shot by our own pickets, as it was now getting dusk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6030"/>I went on, through the woods and fields, avoiding the enemy's fires whenever I saw them, and approaching our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6031"/>I had got very nearly through, when suddenly I came upon <num value="3">three</num> cavalrymen in the middle of the road, near a little bridge I had to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6032"/>I was sure they were <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, so I cocked my pistol, and walked up to them boldly, saying in a loud commonplace tone- </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6051"/>he replied, looking through the dark, <quote>how did you know me?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6052"/></p> 
<p> <quote>By your voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6053"/>I remember meeting you at the <orgName n="Commercial Convention" type="convention">Commercial Convention</orgName> in <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, to which I was a delegate-and making your acquaintance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6054"/></p> 
<p> <quote>What is your name, sir?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6055"/></p> 
<p>I told him, and added, <quote>The regiment you are looking for is down in the fortifications, <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> in that direction; and though it will be going back, I will act as your guide.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6056"/></p> 
<p>So I went with him, and finding some friends in the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS19">Nineteenth Mississippi</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Mott,Colonel,,,," id="n0011.0034.00428.02253" reg="mostcommon:Mott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName>, a friend of mine, I lay down, and went to sleep. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6057"/>On the next morning, I was still talking with my friends of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num>, when chancing to look toward the front, I saw a line of men advancing through the brushwood, who, I was certain, were <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6058"/>It was drizzling, and no attack was expected, though we knew that the enemy was right in our front; and when I told the <rs>Lieutenant</rs>, in command of the <orgName type="company" n="Company I">company I</orgName> was with, that the men in front were certainly <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, he did not believe it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6059"/> <quote>They can't be,</quote> he said; <quote>they are a party of our own men who have been out on a scout toward the enemy, and are coming in.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6060"/></p> 
<p>As he was speaking, the line came on steadily, and I saw distinctly the blue pantaloons, and <rs n="oil cloth" type="product">oil-cloth</rs> capes thrown over their heads as a protection from the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6061"/>I knew from this that it was the enemy, as none of our men had capes; and I jumped up, crying to the men: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6062"/> <quote>They are <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6063"/>Fire, men!

<p> <quote>Hold your fire!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6071"/></p> 
<p>And I ran out pointing at them where they were advancing, within <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards</measure>, in the pines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6072"/> <quote>Don't fire, I say!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6073"/>shouted the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> to his men, <quote>they are friends!</quote>

<p> <quote>Well, <hi rend="italics">I'll</hi> take the responsibility, as far as I am concerned!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6075"/>I said; and levelling my carbine I took aim, and saw <num value="1">one</num> of the men fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6076"/>As soon as I shot, the whole party stopped suddenly, as though they were astonished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6077"/> <quote>Fire!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6078"/>I cried to the <name>Mississippians</name>, <quote>give it to 'em, boys!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6079"/>Charge!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6080"/></p> 
<p>And I blazed away with my pistol as I ran toward them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6081"/><pb id="p.429" n="429"/> They did not wait for the expected charge &mdash; it turned out to be only a company-and broke and ran. I followed, and came to the man I had shot, who was dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6082"/>His gun was lying by him, and I seized it, and fired on them as they were running; but finding no <num value="1">one</num> following me, I concluded I had better go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6083"/>When I got to the fortification I found <persName n="Mott,Colonel,,,," id="n0011.0034.00429.02254" reg="mostcommon:Mott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName> there, attracted by the firing; and showed him the gun I had brought back, telling him that they were <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6084"/> <quote>Certainly they were,</quote> he replied, <quote>and the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> in command ought to have known that there were none of our troops on the left.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6085"/></p> 
<p>As I had nothing to do, I proposed to the <rs>Colonel</rs> that if he would give me half-a-dozen men I would go and scout in front, and bring him any information I could procure of the enemy's movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6086"/>He agreed to this, and called for volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6087"/>A dozen men stepped out, but I told him I did not want more than <num value="6">six</num>; and with these, I went along in the track of the party of <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6088"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> of them was named <persName n="Bryant,,,,," id="n0011.0034.00429.02255" reg="mostcommon:Bryant,nomatch:0"><surname>Bryant</surname></persName>, a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate man, and he stuck to me all day, though he was wounded; but he would not leave me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6089"/>Well, I followed the party, marching the men in single file, and looking out every moment for the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6090"/>I came on their trail at last, and thought I could hear the hum of their voices just over a knoll in front of me. The woods there have hollows in them, and you can get very close to a party of men without knowing it if they are in <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6091"/>There was a hollow of this sort just before me, and the hill sloped up in such a way, that you could get right on them and not be perceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6092"/>I crept up the side of the hill, going from tree to tree, looking and listening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6093"/>I could not see anybody, but I was sure I heard the hum of voices not far off; and I determined to reconnoitre and ascertain who the party were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6094"/>I accordingly went cautiously up the hill, to peep over, leaving my men behind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6095"/>Just as I got near the top I heard the tramp of feet, and could see the heads of the men coming up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6096"/>The officer in command was walking in front, and before I knew it he was right on me, within <measure n="3yards" type="distance">three yards</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6097"/> <quote>Dress up to the right!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6098"/>he cried quickly to his men. <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6099"/> <quote>Dress up, yourself, sir!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6100"/>I shouted to him, suddenly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6101"/>And as I spoke, I levelled my carbine at his breast, fired, and shot him through the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6102"/>Before the enemy had recovered from their surprise, I shouted back, as if I was speaking to my company: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6103"/> <quote>Charge 'em, men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6104"/>Fire on 'em!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6105"/>Char-r-r-rge!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6106"/></p> 
<p>And I set the example by firing my pistol as fast as I could at their heads, which was all I could see above the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6107"/>They fired a volley at me, but their position was too unfavourable, and the bullets went whizzing high up in the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6108"/>My men came up promptly, and we all took trees and commenced skirmishing with them, neither side advancing, but keeping up a scattering fire all the time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6109"/>The captain, when I had shot him, sat down on the ground, and remained there leaning his shoulder against the trunk of a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6110"/>The tree I had dodged behind was not far off, and we carried on a conversation for some time; I suppose about half an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6111"/>I asked him why he had come down to the <rs>South</rs>, and he said he wished now that he had stayed at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6112"/>He said a good many things, but I don't remember them now. His name was a singular <num value="1">one</num>; he told me what it was, and I've got it somewhere; his company was the <hi rend="sub"><num value="47" type="ordinal">47th</num> </hi>Sharpshooters, New York. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6113"/>I had shot away all my ammunition, and I got up and went to him, asking him for his pistol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6114"/>He took hold of the belt, and tried to unbuckle it, but was too weak. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6115"/> <quote>It's no use,</quote> he said, <quote>I can't undo it, and you had better go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6116"/>You will just make them shoot both of us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6117"/></p> 
<p>He did not look as if he was shot; I could see no marks of a wound; but soon after I had gone back to my tree, he raised his shoulder from the trunk which he was leaning against, sat upright, and then fell upon his back, dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6118"/>About this time there was a general advance of our line upon the enemy, all along; and the company of sharpshooters fell back, firing as they went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6119"/>Our troops came along, and charged their main line, which was posted behind a fence, some distance in front; and here <persName n="Mott,Colonel,,,," id="n0011.0034.00430.02256" reg="mostcommon:Mott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName> was killed as he was leading the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6120"/>I went along with them, but had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gotten the dead <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> officer's sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6121"/>As soon as our men advanced, and the enemy went away, I came from behind the tree where I had been sitting down firing, and approached the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6122"/>He was lying on his back, with his eyes open-dead from my bullet, which had passed through his breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6123"/>I had no sword, having left mine behind that morning; so I unbuckled his belt, and drew it from under his body, and buckled it around my own waist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6124"/>It had a good pistol and cap-pouch, besides the sword, on it &mdash; I have the sword still. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6125"/>That was a hot day, <quote>concluded the <rs>Captain</rs>;</quote> this was where <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> -- got wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6135"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> put his bayonet at him, and he soon surrendered his pistol. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6136"/>Soon afterwards <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> had a duel at <measure n="10yards" type="distance">ten yards</measure> distance, with a Yankee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6137"/>They loaded and fired <num value="20">twenty</num> times without hitting each other, until <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> made a good shot and bored him through the breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6329"/>My captured horse was an animal of superb action, and I soon found that I must make him show his points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6331"/>Between these and the pickets which would certainly bar my passage, I seemed to stand little chance; but it was worth the trial, and I went on at full speed, keeping as much as possible in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6333"/>What words, however, can describe my mortification when, issuing from a dense covert, I found they had followed by a parallel road, and were on my very heels!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6710"/>On the borders of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, in the good old times, there was a <quote>Debatable land</quote> --bone of contention between Pict and Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0011.0038.00467.02372" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,Louis,,,:1"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6713"/>Our <quote>Debatable land</quote> was, in fact, all that fine and beautiful country lying between the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the last-named river, over which the opposing armies of the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> alternately advanced and retired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6714"/>This land was the home of the scout; the chosen field of the ranger and the partisan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6715"/><persName n="Mosby,,,,," id="n0011.0038.00467.02374" reg="mostcommon:Mosby,Jack,,,:1"><surname>Mosby</surname></persName> was king there: and his liegemen lived as jovial lives as did the followers of Robin Hood in Sherwood Forest, in the old days of Merry <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6717"/>The subject would become enthralling were it to be more than alluded to &mdash; the pen would drag the hand into a sketch, and not a short <num value="1">one</num>, of that splendid ranger-life amid the <name>Fauquier</name> forests, the heart of <quote><persName n="Mosby,,,,," id="n0011.0038.00467.02376" reg="mostcommon:Mosby,Jack,,,:1"><surname>Mosby</surname></persName>'s Confederacy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6718"/>Not to-day can I delineate the lithe, keen partisan, with his roving glance, his thin curling lip, his loose swaying belt containing the brace of pistols ready loaded and capped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6719"/>Some abler hand must <pb id="p.468" n="468"/> draw the chief of rangers, and relate his exploits &mdash; the design of the present writer is to record some adventures of <quote>scout life,</quote> which differs in many points from that of the regular partisan, though not wholly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6720"/>The scout proper is <quote>commanding in the field,</quote> with no <num value="1">one</num> near to give him orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6721"/>He goes and comes at will, having that about him which all pickets obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6722"/>He is <quote>on detached service;</quote> and having procured certain information, reports to the officer who has sent him, without intermediate ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6723"/>Operating within the enemy's lines at all times, he depends for success and safety on the quickness of his eye and hand-and his reliance on these is great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6724"/>He is silent in his movements, low-toned in his speech, abstemious in his habits, and as untiring on the track of the enemy as the <name>Cuban</name> blood-hound on the trail of the fugitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6725"/>He sleeps rarely in houses, preferring the woods; and always slumbers <quote>with <num value="1">one</num> eye open,</quote> on the look out for his enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6726"/>The scout has a thorough knowledge of the country, and is even acquainted with <quote>every hog path.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6727"/>He travels in the woods; and often in crossing a sandy highway dismounts, and backs his horse across the road, to mislead the enemy, on the watch for <quote>guerillas,</quote> as to the direction of his march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6728"/>He thus <quote>flanks</quote> their pickets, penetrates to their camps, reconnoitres their number and position, and strives to pick up some straggler whom he can pump for information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6729"/>Thus lurking and prowling around the enemy's camps, by night and day, the scout never relaxes his exertions until he discovers what he wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6730"/>That discovery once made &mdash; of the strength, situation, and probable designs of the enemy &mdash; the stealthy emissary <quote>snakes</quote> back as he came; mounts his trusty steed in the depth of the wood; and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> listening attentively, sets out on his return with his supply of valuable information. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6731"/>If he cannot <quote>flank</quote> the enemy's pickets, he charges them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6732"/>If he cannot glide through, he fights through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6733"/>If he meets a straggling enemy or enemies not in too great number, he puts his pistol to his or their heads, and brings him or them alongpleasantly chatting with them as he goes along, but keeping his eye and his pistol muzzle upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6734"/><pb id="p.469" n="469"/> </p> 
<p>When he relates his adventures, he does so with a laughnoting the humorous side of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6735"/>Indeed his life seems chiefly attractive to him from that very humorous phase, and he jests about his perils with a gay light spirit which is <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest charms of his society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6736"/>He has extricated himself from deadly peril safely, <quote>fooled</quote> his foe, and is chatting after the occurrence with his friends by the camp fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6737"/>Could anything be more satisfactory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6738"/>So the scout plays over the comedy for your entertainment; relates every incident in a spirit of dry humour; rolls up in his blanket by the fire when he is tired; and, before daylight, has disappeared on another expedition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6739"/>Thus toiling, watching, and fighting, enduring hardship, risking liberty and life hourly, the scout passes his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6740"/>He is not a paid spy &mdash; not a spy at all, for he goes uniformed and armed, and the work is his reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6741"/>The trump of fame will never sound for him. If he falls, it will be in the depths of some forest, where his bones will moulder away undiscovered; if he survives, he will return to obscurity as a rain-drop sinks into the ocean and is seen no more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6742"/>That will be his fate; but while he is alive, he lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6743"/>He loves his vocation, and gives to the cause what he possesses &mdash; a piercing eye, a ready hand, and a daring soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6744"/>For his services, often invaluable, and his risk of life night and day, he receives-when he can get it-<measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure> a month; and with this, or with nothing, he is perfectly content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6745"/>What he asks is simply the liberty to rove; to hunt the enemy after the fashion most agreeable to him; to have himself killed, if the killing must take place, in single combat, with the pistol, rather than in line of battle with the musket. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6746"/>It results from this that the life of the scout is apt to be crowded with adventure, contrast, and all that is picturesque.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6747"/>Here to-day, away to-morrow; closeted with the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>, while an orderly keeps off all intruders, and then disappearing like a shadow on some secret mission; passing the most obdurate pickets with a single word; silently appearing in the houses of friends far behind the enemy's lines; reconnoitring their camps, picking up stragglers, attacking them alone or in <pb id="p.470" n="470"/> company with others, upon all occasions-such are some of the phases which the scout exhibits, such some of the occupations of his stirring existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6748"/>A few of these adventurous incidents are here recorded just as I heard them from an accomplished scout of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0038.00470.02377" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6749"/>They will be found sufficiently <quote>romantic,</quote> but I believe them to be exactly true. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6750"/>As such, they possess a value which no mere fiction could. </p></div1>

<head>Hunted down.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6751"/>Among the numerous scouts employed by <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0039.00471.02378" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, none was braver or more intelligent than a young man named <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> S-. Innumerable were his adventures, almost incredible his hair-breadth escapes and his reckless, dare-devil exploits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6752"/>The annals of fiction contain nothing more curious and moving than some of his experiences; and in this and the succeeding sketch I propose to indicate the species of daily life which S &mdash; lived during the late war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/>A few words, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, of the scout himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>He certainly was a ranger born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6755"/>Passionately devoted to his dangerous calling, and following it from predilection, not from any hope of reward, or spurred on by ambition of distinction, he was never so happy as when beating up the quarters of the enemy, and throwing them into confusion by some sudden attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6756"/>He was not an officer, and never moved a finger to secure a commission; all he asked was permission to mount his horse, wander off and seek the neighbourhood of the enemy's camps, in search of incident and adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6757"/>On such occasions he preferred to be alone, to follow his appointed work without assistance, depending only upon his own strong arm and trusty weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6758"/>He cared little for society, though no <num value="1">one</num> seemed more amiable; I never saw a brighter or more friendly smile than his. That smile did not deceive; there was no deceit of any sort in S . He loved his <pb id="p.472" n="472"/> friends, but he loved his calling better still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6759"/>It might have been said of him that man delighted him not, nor woman either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6760"/>His <quote>chief delight</quote> was to penetrate the dense woods of <placeName key="tgn,1002368" n="1.000 4" reg="fauquier, virginia, united states">Fauquier</placeName>, assail the enemy wherever he found an opening, and inflict upon them all the injury in his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6761"/>In the eyes of the scout those enemies were wolves, and he hunted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6762"/>This sketch will demonstrate the fact that now and then they returned the compliment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6763"/>In person S &mdash; was suited to his calling; stout but active; a good hand with pistol and sabre; quick of eye; and with nerves which no peril could shake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6764"/>Soldiers generally prefer broad daylight and an open country to operate; S-liked a forest where no moon shone; whose soft earth gave back no sound when the hoofs of his horse fell upon it; and where even in the gloomy silence of midnight he could approach a vidette undiscovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6765"/>When he found it necessary to penetrate the hostile lines, and could not elude the watchful guardians of the night, his habit was to brace himself in his stirrups, draw his pistol, and to the quick, <quote>Halt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6766"/>Who goes there?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6767"/>shout, <quote>Form fours!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6768"/>Draw sabres!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6769"/>Charge!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6770"/>to an imaginary squadron behind him, and pass on with loud yells, firing his pistol as he advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6771"/>The result was, generally, that the picket fired wildly at him, and then fled before the tremendous onslaught of <quote>rebel cavalry,</quote> whereupon the adventurous scout passed through at a thundering gallop, drove the picket before him, and adroitly slipping, at the opportune moment, into some by-path of the woods, was <quote>within the lines.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6772"/>When the enemy made a stand at the next rising ground to receive the expected charge, none came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6773"/>When they returned to look for S--, he had disappeared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6774"/>But to come to the incident I design narrating. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6775"/>It was in <dateStruct value="1863-11-"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, when the <rs>Federal</rs> army lay around <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richardson, Pearl River, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057346">Mitchell's Station</placeName>, that S &mdash; was sent on a scout to ascertain the number, position, and movements of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6776"/>Taking with him <num value="2">two</num> companions, he crossed the upper <rs>Rapidan</rs>, passed the <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName> pickets, and carefully worked his way toward <placeName reg="Richardson, Pearl River, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057346">Mitchell's Station</placeName>. <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0011.0039.00472.02379" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> had pushed forward his lines to this point a <pb id="p.473" n="473"/> few days before-or rather established large camps there-and this fact, visible from <persName n="Clark,,,,," id="n0011.0039.00473.02380" reg="mostcommon:Clark,nomatch:0"><surname>Clark</surname></persName>'s mountain, made it desirable to ascertain, if possible, his designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6777"/>This was S&mdash;&lsquo;s mission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6778"/>In due time the small party reached the vicinity of the station, and it now became necessary to prosecute the remainder of the journey on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6779"/>They accordingly dismounted, and leaving their horses in a thick copse, <quote>snaked</quote> in the direction of a large Federal camp near at hand, taking advantage of every cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6780"/>In this manner they came close upon the camp, and were rewarded with a sight of acres of canvas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6781"/>Lazy-looking infantry were strolling about, quarter-guards walking their posts, and officers in gay uniforms went to and fro, saluted by the sentinels with a <quote>present</quote> as they passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6782"/>The size of the encampments enabled S &mdash; to form a tolerably accurate estimate of the amount of force which <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0011.0039.00473.02381" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> had concentrated at this point; and having passed the whole day thus moving cautiously around the spot, thereby discovering all which a mere reconnoissance could reveal, the scout began to look for stragglers, from whom, as his prisoners, he might derive more accurate information still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6783"/>The love of rambling is inherent in soldiers of every nation; and the prospect of butter and eggs, resulting from a foraging expedition to the neighbouring farms, was well known to be irresistible with the <rs>Federal</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6784"/>To pick up these wandering foragers, if they were not in too great numbers, was the object of S&mdash; . His method on such occasions was to come upon the individual or the party unawares, silently present the muzzle of his pistol, and <quote>take them in charge.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6785"/>Once his prisoners, all was friendly and peaceful, and all the information possible was extracted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6786"/>After a fatiguing day, S&mdash; and his party lay down in the woods near the <rs>Federal</rs> camp, to snatch an hour's sleep before proceeding to their nocturnal work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6787"/>But on this occasion, Fate had determined to play them a sorry trick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6788"/>The <quote>stragglers</quote> whom they designed hunting and entrapping during the hours of darkness were to <quote>turn up</quote> in a fashion and at a moment neither expected nor desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6789"/>The woful adventures which befell the scout and his companions I now proceed to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6790"/><pb id="p.474" n="474"/> </p> 
<p>S&mdash; had selected for his bivouac a retired spot where the encircling woods gave excellent promise of concealment, and the covert was so dense as to set him completely at his ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6791"/>Through the thick brushwood no glimmer of firelight could be seen; and the scouts ventured to kindle a fire, which the chill <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> night rendered far from unacceptable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6792"/>By the carefully shaded blaze they warmed their benumbed fingers, ate their supplies of hard bread and bacon, and spread their blankets for a brief sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6793"/>S &mdash; took off his shoes; laid his hat at his head; and having picked up somewhere a certain <quote>Life of <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n0011.0039.00474.02382" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>,</quote> recently published in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, now drew it from his haversack, and read a few passages by the firelight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6794"/>Although he did not inform me of the fact, this volume must have produced a soothing effect upon his feelings, for in a short time his eyelids drooped, the volume fell from his hands, and he sank to slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6795"/>His companions were already snoring by his side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6796"/>They slept longer than they designed doing &mdash; in fact throughout the entire night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6797"/>The weather, which had been lowering at nightfall, became gradually more threatening; and soon an imperceptible drizzle began, just sufficient to wet the blankets of the sleepers, but not to chill and awake them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6798"/>They slept on serenely; and now as day drew near, the hostile Fate approached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6799"/>It came in the shape of a squad of infantry soldiers, armed with muskets, from the adjoining camp; and this party, on their way to forage for butter, eggs, poultry, and other desirable components of a military breakfast, had stumbled on the slumbering scouts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6800"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation which S &mdash; had of the danger which menaced him was, he declared, an instinctive feeling that some dangerous foe was near; and this even before he woke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6801"/>He was not long, however, to remain in doubt, or be compelled to question his instincts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6802"/>He opened his eyes to find the blanket suddenly drawn away from his face, and to hear a harsh and sarcastic voice exclaim: <quote>How are you, <persName n="Reb,,Johnny,,," id="n0011.0039.00474.02383" reg="default:Reb,Johnny,,,"><foreName>Johnny</foreName> <surname>Reb</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6803"/>Come, get up, and we will give you more comfortable accommodations than out here in the rain!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6804"/></p> 
<p>S&mdash; was wide-awake in an instant, and through his halfclosed <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> lids reconnoitred, counting his opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6805"/>They were <num value="6">six</num> in number, all armed and ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6806"/>The situation looked ugly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6807"/>With his companions wide-awake and on the alert there might have been some ground for hope; but they were slumbering like the <num value="7">Seven</num> Sleepers, and in utter unconsciousness of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6808"/>As to S &mdash; himself, he was in their very grasp, and practically disarmed; for it was obvious that at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement which he made to draw his pistol from the holster around his waist, the <num value="6">six</num> muskets, cocked and pointing at his breast, would be discharged as <num value="1">one</num> piece, and his body riddled with bullets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6809"/>The situation was depressing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6810"/>S &mdash; and his companions were in a veritable trap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6811"/>The least movement which he made would at once put an end to him, if <num value="6">six</num> balls through the body could do so; and it was obviously necessary to surrender at once or betake himself to strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6812"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was out of the question, for S-had made up his mind never to surrender, had indeed sworn a solemn oath not to do so under any circumstances; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> alternative remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6813"/>A <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi> had already suggested itself to his quick and daring mind; and this he now proceeded instantly to carry out. To the sneering address of his opponent bidding him get up, he made no immediate reply, but again closed his eyes, pulled the blanket up again over his shoulders, and turning his back, muttered in a sleepy voice: <quote>Oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6814"/>Go away, and let me sleep, will you!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6815"/></p> 
<p>This reply highly tickled his adversaries; and so much did they relish the evident impression of the <quote><persName n="Reb,,Johnny,,," id="n0011.0039.00475.02384" reg="default:Reb,Johnny,,,"><foreName>Johnny</foreName> <surname>Reb</surname></persName></quote> that he was among his own comrades in the <rs>Confederate</rs> camp, that they shook all over in the excess of their mirth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6816"/>S-was a dangerous man, however, to jest with; and no doubt believed in the proverb which declares that <quote>they laugh best who laugh last.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6817"/>While his opponents were thus indulging their merriment, and highly enjoying the surprise and mortification he would feel when awake to the real nature of his situation, S &mdash; was busy executing the plan which he had determined upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6818"/>Pulling his blanket still further over his head, he drew a long labouring breath, turned as men do languidly in slumber, and cautiously moved his hand beneath the blanket toward the pistol in his belt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6819"/>The hand <pb id="p.476" n="476"/> slowly stole downwards under the cover, approached the weapon, and then he had grasped the handle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6820"/>A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> careless movement extracted the pistol from the holster; his finger was on the hammer-without noise the weapon was cocked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6821"/>The scout was just in time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6822"/>The squad had finished their laugh, enjoyed their little comedy sufficiently, and now designed bringing the affair to an end. The leader accordingly stooped down and dragged away the blanket-when a shot followed, with the muzzle of the pistol upon his breast, and he fell forward dead, covering S &mdash; with his blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6823"/>The scene which followed was brief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6824"/>The rest of the squad levelled their muskets at the scout, and fired with the muzzles nearly touching him, but he was wounded by none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6825"/>The body of their companion lying across him received the larger portion of the balls; and S&mdash; rose to his feet, armed with his deadly revolver, which still contained <num value="4">four</num> charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6826"/>These he fired in succession rapidly, but with good aim, and <num value="2">two</num> of the <num value="5">five</num> remaining men were wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6827"/>The <num value="3">three</num> others, finding their guns discharged, dropped them, and hastily ran toward the <rs>Federal</rs> camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6828"/>S&mdash;&lsquo;s companions had been aroused by the firing, but were of no assistance to him. <num value="1">One</num> disgracefully fled into the woods without firing a shot, and the other had committed the fatal fault of allowing his arms to become wetted by the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6829"/>When he attempted to fire his pistol the cap snapped, and none of the barrels could be discharged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6830"/>This proved, however, of no great importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6831"/>S&mdash; had repulsed the whole party for the moment, and did not need assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6832"/>What remained for them now was a rapid retreat from the dangerous locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6833"/>The sudden firing, and the men running in, had alarmed the <rs>Federal</rs> camp, and a large party were seen approaching rapidly to take vengeance for the blood of their comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6834"/>S &mdash; accordingly hastened to retire, and disappeared with his companion just as the enemy rushed upon the area near the bivouac fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6835"/>In this sudden <quote>change of base,</quote> stores of some value to him were necessarily abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6836"/>In fact he was compelled to leave his horse, hat, shoes, blanket, and <quote>Life of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0011.0039.00476.02385" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName></quote> --to fly bareheaded and in his stocking feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6837"/>Even thus <pb id="p.477" n="477"/> lightened of all superfluous weight, it was doubtful if he could escape; for the shouts which now resounded as he ran showed that the enemy were pursuing him hotly, with the evident determination of running him <quote>to earth</quote> and destroying him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6838"/>In a few moments it became plain to S- that he was to be <quote>hunted down.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6839"/>In fact, the encounter at the bivouac-resulting so disastrously to the assailants-had profoundly enraged their friends, and a large detachment speedily scattered, blocking up every avenue by which the scout could escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6840"/>In the distance cavalry could be seen preparing to cut him off from the mountain, and before S-had gone half a mile he awoke to the unpleasant consciousness that he was surrounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6841"/>Stealing along, a solitary figure &mdash; for his companion had gone another way-he peered warily from his covert, seeking a loop-hole of escape; but wherever he turned the paths were picketed, and the chances of escape seemed hopeless indeed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6842"/>Under circumstances so discouraging, an ordinary man would have lost <quote>heart of hope.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6843"/>But S- was not an ordinary man. His perilous situation only developed the strong manhood of his character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6844"/>He surveyed his position at a glance, and estimated the chances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6845"/>It seemed that nothing but his own quick eye and knowledge of woodcraft could save him; if he was caught, there appeared to be small likelihood of his escaping death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6846"/>He had penetrated the <rs>Federal</rs> lines, reconnoitred their encampments, slain their foraging parties; and although this was done in full Confederate uniform, with arms at his side, as a legitimate partisan operation, S &mdash; had little doubts of the light in which his enemies would insist upon regarding him. He felt that he would probably be treated as a <quote>guerilla,</quote> if not as a spy, and shot without benefit of clergy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6847"/>For this reason he did not intend to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6848"/>He proposed to escape if he could; if he could not, he would sell his life as dearly as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6849"/><num value="1">One</num> conviction is apt to result very powerfully from scout life &mdash; that few situations are so greatly hopeless that skill and nerve will not extricate their possessor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6850"/>S-had these qualities in great perfection, and now brought all his courage and <pb id="p.478" n="478"/> <hi rend="italics">finesse</hi> to bear upon the contest for life and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6851"/>His enemies were on every side following the trail of their game, and with videttes posted at every point around, were beating the covert for the prey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6852"/>S- had, however, been hunted before, and his brave heart did not recoil from the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6853"/>Running silently with bare head and shoeless feet through the woods, he paused from time to time to listen to the shouts of his pursuers, and it soon became obvious that they were rapidly approaching upon every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6854"/>However fleet of foot he might be, and whatever might be his accomplishments in woodcraft, the probabilities of escape grew more and more doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6855"/>As he doubled, and turned, and circled, like a hunted wolf, the enemy every instant drew nearer, and soon their detached parties were nearly upon him. It was evident that they knew the country perfectly; and such was their success in intercepting his retreat, that he very soon found himself completely hemmed in, and his enemies in every direction cutting off his escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6856"/>The parties gradually closed in upon him on every side, and in a few minutes more, unless he could discover some place of concealment, he must inevitably fall into their hands, when a bullet or a cord would terminate the hunt and his career on earth at the same time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6857"/>This conviction induced S&mdash; , whose nerve had never faltered, to seek on every side for some hiding-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6858"/>But the result was discouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6859"/>The woods were open-without undergrowth --and every moment was now precious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6860"/>S&mdash; redoubled his speed, and darting through the wood, suddenly found himself in a small open field, in the middle of which rose a clump of pines, <num value="1">one</num> of which had recently fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6861"/>In the bushy top of this fallen tree he now concealed himself, panting from his long run, and listening to the sound of his approaching foes closing in on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6862"/>To fight and die seemed his only resource; and reloading his pistol, he grimly waited for the moment which should find him at bay, in the presence of his enemies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6863"/>He did not wait long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6864"/>A few minutes only had elapsed when a party of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> Federals entered the little area, and approached the clump of pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6865"/>They passed close to the scout, <pb id="p.479" n="479"/> looking everywhere for traces of him; but he crouched down, held his breath, and they seemed about to prosecute their search in some other direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6866"/>S- was indeed congratulating himself upon his safety, when, raising his head, he caught the eye of <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy, who had lingered behind the rest, fixed steadily upon him. He was discovered; and starting to his feet, was greeted with the shout, <quote>Here he is!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6867"/>which was instantly echoed by a <num value="100">hundred</num> voices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6868"/>S- now saw that his life hung upon a thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6869"/>Unless he could force his way through the cordon hemming him in, he was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6870"/>He was unwilling to waste the loads in his pistols before the final struggle took place &mdash; the last desperate struggle which was to terminate all. But that conflict now seemed about to take place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6871"/>For a single instant the scout and his foes stood looking at each other, and neither made any movement to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6872"/>In presence of this desperate man, the enemy seemed averse to the encounter, and waited for their comrades to come up. This short pause gave the scout the opportunity to decide upon his course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6873"/>If he could only secure a short <quote>start,</quote> --if he were only mounted!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6874"/>His feet were bruised and sore, his strength greatly diminished by the close, hot chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6875"/>Oh! for a horse to charge them and break through, as he felt he could though they were <num value="40">forty</num> deep!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6876"/>As the thought flashed through his mind, his eyes fell on a mule which was grazing in the field not far from him. To dart to the animal and throw himself upon its back was the work of an instant; and in the midst of furious outcries and hastily fired shots he dug his heels into the sides of the frightened animal, and commenced his race for life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6877"/>Behold S- now, mounted on his mule, with bare head and shoeless feet, grasping the mane of the animal with <num value="1">one</num> hand, holding his pistol in the other, and driving onward like some grotesque figure of the <name>German</name> ballads!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6878"/>Such was the speed to which he forced the animal, that he would probably have distanced his pursuers had not the perversity of the brute defeated all his calculations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6879"/>The mule had no sooner recovered from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fright at finding himself so unceremoniously <pb id="p.480" n="480"/> mounted, than he made violent attempts by <quote>roaching</quote> his back, and kicking up, to unseat his rider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6880"/>S-- was an excellent horseman, and might have defied the kicking &mdash; up portion of the performance, despite the fact that he was riding without saddle or bridle; but no horsemanship could counteract the detestable roaching of the animal's spine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6881"/>At the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> or <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> kick-up, accompanied by a movement which made the mule resemble an angry cat in outline, the scout was landed on <hi rend="italics">terra firma</hi>, amid the shouts of his enemies, who rushed toward him, firing as they came. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6882"/>They reached the spot, uttering outcries and curses; but their obstinate foe had once more eluded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6883"/>The scout had risen quickly, darted into the woods, and the chase again commenced with more ardour than at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6884"/>S&mdash; now put forth all his remaining strength to distance the enemy, following more hotly than ever on his track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6885"/>Panting and worn out almost, half resolving a <num value="100">hundred</num> times to turn and fight and die, he still kept on, the shouts of his enemies in his very ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6886"/>He was growing desperate, and had become nearly exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6887"/>A burning thirst raged in his throat; and although the enemy were on his very heels, he could not resist the temptation, as he reached a little meadow through which ran a limpid stream, to pause and quench his thirst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6888"/>Throwing himself upon his knees on the margin of the brook, he stooped and swallowed <num value="1">one</num> refreshing draught of the cool water, and then rising up, found from the shouts of his pursuers that they were at last upon him-all further hope from flight of no avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6889"/>A last desperate expedient suggested itself-concealment in the undergrowth which skirted the stream; and throwing himself at full length amid the bushes, not far from the spot where he had knelt down, he hastily drew the undergrowth around him and awaited the struggle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6890"/>He had scarcely disappeared from view when his enemies reached the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6891"/>He heard their footsteps; their cries resounded; and suddenly the voice of <num value="1">one</num> of them exclaimed: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6892"/> </p> 
<p>Here's the scoundrel's knee-print in the sand where he drank just now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6893"/>He ain't far off!</p></quote> <pb id="p.481" n="481"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6894"/>This cry was the signal for all the detached parties to converge toward the spot; and very soon the field was full of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6895"/>The scout heard them deploying in every direction to guard all the outlets, preparatory to a rigid search of every species of covert in which a fugitive could conceal himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6896"/>The green meadow was dotted with clumps of bushes, which grew in thicker luxuriance along the little watercourse; and in some of these hidingplaces it was obvious to the enemy that their victim lay hidden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6897"/>The prey was at last hunted down; had taken to earth; and it was now only necessary to beat the undergrowth with efficient diligence in order to flush the dangerous game. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6898"/>The hunters proceeded to their task with energy and excellent method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6899"/>No portion of the ground was neglected, and their attention was especially directed to the bushes along the stream. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6900"/>Lying on his back in the dense jungle, with a cocked pistol in each hand, his finger on the trigger, the scout listened with ears rendered preternaturally acute to the cries and exclamations of his enemies, who moved up and down the watercourse, and on every hand searching every foot of ground for their prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6901"/>S- had not wasted a moment in deciding upon his plan of action if discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6902"/>He was exhausted, and could no longer fly; and to be taken prisoner was not an alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6903"/>He would fight as long as he could stand; give his enemies the full benefit of the <measure n="10barrels" type="mass">ten barrels</measure> of his revolvers at close range; grapple with them breast to breast; and if he could not fight his way out-die. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6904"/>Such was his plan; and he listened to the footsteps around him with that firm nerve which the brave man summons to his aid when face to face with death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6905"/>The moment had now come which was to decide his fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6906"/>The pursuers had searched every portion of the field without success, and now returned to the point from which they had set forth, subjecting the covert to a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and more rigid inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6907"/>Their feet were heard trampling amid the undergrowth; they stopped to put aside the bushes, and peer into every nook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6908"/>S&mdash; heard their very breathing, and cast an eye upon his pistols to see that he had neglected nothing; that every tube was capped, every barrel loaded, and both weapons cocked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6909"/><pb id="p.482" n="482"/> All was right, and he experienced the fierce joy of the man who feels that at least he need not die without dragging down more than <num value="1">one</num> enemy in his fall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6910"/>The steps were at his side; oaths and exclamations echoed in his very ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6911"/><num value="1">One</num> of the hostile party determined to leave no inch of the ground unexplored, and bent down, plunging his glances into the very bushes over the scout's head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6912"/>S- grasped his pistols with a firmer clutch, strung his nerves for instant contest, and prepared to rise suddenly to his feet, lay the curious individual before him dead with a pistol bullet through the heart, and throw himself like a tiger at bay into the midst of his enemies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6913"/>The bushes were thrust aside; an oath resounded within <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> of him; he had covered the heart of his enemy with the muzzle of his right-hand pistol crossed over his breast-when the autumn foliage swayed back to its place, an exclamation of disappointment followed, and the footsteps retreated from his hiding-place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6914"/>The scout drew a long breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6915"/>He was saved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6916"/>All day long he lay hidden, hearing more than <num value="1">one</num> sound which proved that his enemies were still hovering near; but they had given up the search in despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6917"/>At night he quietly rose, and found that the coast was clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6918"/>Proceeding cautiously to reconnoitre, he discovered that the ground around his hiding-place was only partially guarded, and had little difficulty in escaping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6919"/>Eluding such parties as were still prowling around, he flanked the <rs>Federal</rs> pickets, travelled all night, and before daylight was safe within the <rs>Southern</rs> lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6920"/>Such was the narrative of S&mdash; , related to me in my tent on the <rs>Rapidan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6921"/>To suspect exaggeration or inaccuracy in the narrator would be to do a brave and truthful soldier great injustice; and I have recorded this true incident as a veritable illustration of the curious <quote>scout-life</quote> of the war. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6922"/>In <quote>Hunted down,</quote> I have attempted to give some idea of scout life on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> during the late war. Another narrative of the same description may interest those readers who relish wild adventure; and the present incident will be found more curious than the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6923"/>It befell the same personage, S--, <num value="1">one</num> of <orgName n="scouts"><persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0011.0040.00483.02386" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Hardeman,,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s scouts</orgName>, and I again beg to warn the worthy reader against regarding these relations as fanciful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6924"/>Imagination has nothing to do with this <num value="1">one</num>; if it possesses no other merit, I am sure it does possess that of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6925"/>It was told me by the brave man whom it concerns, and I never knew him to boast or exaggerate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6926"/>The incident took place during the summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, in the country beyond the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, not far from the foot of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6927"/>This region &mdash; the county of <placeName reg="Fauquier, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002368">Fauquier</placeName>--was the true Paradise of the scout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6928"/>On its winding and unfrequented roads, and amid its rolling hills and mountain spurs, the scout and ranger wandered at will, bidding defiance to all comers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6929"/>The thick woods enabled him to approach unseen until almost in contact with the <rs>Federal</rs> parties or their encampments; and if pursued, he had only to leap the nearest stone wall, rush under a crest of a hill, and disappear like a shadow, or <num value="1">one</num> of those phantoms of diablerie which vanish in the recesses of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6930"/>For secret operations of every description, no country in the <pb id="p.484" n="484"/> world is more favourable; and the present writer has journeyed by roads and across fords in the immediate vicinity of hostile forces, by which a column of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men might have moved with no more difficulty than a solitary horseman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6931"/>No prying eyes followed the scout upon his way; the extensive uplands were pasture ground for grazing great herds of cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6932"/>The traveller went on, mile after mile, unespied by any <num value="1">one</num>, and in presence only of tall forests and azure mountains. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6933"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1002368" n="1.000 4" reg="fauquier, virginia, united states">Fauquier</placeName>, S- had many friends whom he was fond of visiting on his adventurous excursions; but unfortunately he had also a number of enemies in the persons of Federal soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6934"/>Detached bodies of the enemy had pitched their tents in the region, and the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry scouted the main roads, greatly harassing the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6935"/>To harass their parties in return was the work of the ranger; and scarce a day passed without some collision in the extensive fields or the forest glades, in which, on <num value="1">one</num> side or both, blood would flow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6936"/>Among the <rs>Federal</rs> forces, S-had achieved a high reputation as a scout and a partisan; and had also aroused in his enemies a profound hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6937"/>His daring reconnoissances, secret scouts, and audacious attacks on foraging parties, had made them pass a lively time-and great was the joy of a Federal <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> commanding pickets on the upper <rs>Rappahannock</rs> when he received intelligence <num value="1">one</num> day in this summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> that the well known S&mdash; was alone at a house not far from camp, where his capture would be easy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6938"/>S&mdash; was, in fact, at the house indicated, without the least suspicion that his presence had been discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6939"/>He had been sent upon a scout in that region, and finding himself in the neighbourhood of the family with whom he had long been on terms of intimacy, embraced the occasion to visit them and rest for a few hours before proceeding upon his way. On the evening when the events about to be related occurred, he was seated in the parlour, conversing with <num value="1">one</num> of the young ladies of the family, and perfectly at his ease both in body and mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6940"/>His horse &mdash; an excellent <num value="1">one</num>, captured a few days before from the enemy &mdash; was in the stable, enjoying a plentiful supply of corn; <pb id="p.485" n="485"/> he had himself just partaken of a most inviting supper, to which bright eyes and smiles had communicated an additional attraction; and he was now sitting on the sofa, engaged in conversation, not dreaming of the existence of an enemy within a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure>. Let it not be supposed, however, that S-was disarmed either of his caution or his weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6941"/>His eye wandered unconsciously, from pure habit, every few moments toward the door, and around his waist was still buckled the well-worn belt containing his pistols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6942"/>These never left his person day or night as long as he was in the vicinity of his enemies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6943"/>Such was the comfortable and peaceful <quote>interiour</quote> which the mansion presented when the incident I purpose to relate took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6944"/>S- was tranquilly enjoying himself in the society of his kind hostess, and laughing with the light-hearted carelessness of a boy who finds a <quote>spirit of mirth</quote> in everything, when suddenly his quick ear caught the clatter of hoofs upon the road without, and rising, he went to the window to reconnoitre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6945"/>A glance told him that the new-comers were the enemy; and the crack through which he looked was sufficiently large to enable him to see that they consisted of a detachment of Federal cavalry, who now rapidly approached the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6946"/>With such rapidity did they advance, that before S- could move they had reached the very door; and no sooner had they done so, than at a brief order from the officer commanding, several men detached themselves from the troop, hurried to the rear of the house, and in an instant every avenue of escape was effectually cut off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6947"/>S&mdash; was now fairly entrapped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6948"/>It was obvious that in some manner the enemy had gained intelligence of his presence at the house, and sent out a detachment for his capture or destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6949"/>The scout required no better proof of this than the systematic manner in which they went to work to surround the house, as though perfectly sure of their game, and the business-like method of proceeding generally on the part of the men and officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6950"/>To meet this sudden and dangerous advance of his foes, S &mdash; saw that he must act with rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6951"/>Skill and decision would alone save him, if anything could; and in a few rapid <pb id="p.486" n="486"/> words he explained the state of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6952"/>He informed his entertainers that he was the game for whom they were hunting; he had heard that a price was set upon his head; if there was no means of leaving the house or concealing himself, he did not mean to surrender; he would not be taken alive, but would fight his way through the whole party and make his escape, or die defending himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6953"/>Such was the tenor of the brief address made by S to his fair entertainers; but they informed him in quick words that he need not despair, they would conceal him; and then the brave hearts set to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6954"/><num value="1">One</num> ran to the window and demanded who was without; another closed the door in rear, the front door being already shut; and while these movements were in progress S&mdash; was hurried up the staircase by <num value="1">one</num> of the young ladies, who was to show him his hiding-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6955"/>Before he had reached the head of the staircase a novel proof was given by the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry of the terror which they attached to his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6956"/>A sudden explosion from without shook the windows; <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> carbineballs pierced the front door, passed through and whistled around the ladies; and a loud shout was heard, followed by heavy shoulders thrust against the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6957"/>It was afterwards discovered that the rattle of the door-latch in the wind had occasioned the volley; the noise was supposed to be that made by S&mdash; as he was about to rush out upon them! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6958"/>The scout had, meanwhile, been conducted by his fair guide to his hiding-place, which was in a garret entirely destitute of furniture, with bare walls, and apparently without any imaginable facility for enabling a man to escape the prying eyes of the <quote>party of observation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6959"/>Here, nevertheless, S &mdash; was concealed; and his hiding-place was excellent, from its very simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6960"/>The garret had no ceiling; and the joists were even unboarded; but upon them were stretched <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> loose planks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6961"/>The young lady hurriedly pointed to these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6962"/>S- understood in an instant; and, swinging himself up, he reached the joist, lay down at full length upon <num value="1">one</num> of the planks next to the caves, and found himself completely protected from observation, unless the search for him was so minute as to leave no corner unexplored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6963"/><pb id="p.487" n="487"/> </p> 
<p>Having assisted the scout to ensconce himself in his hiding place, the young lady hastened down from the garret, and descended the main staircase, just as the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers burst open the front door and swarmed into the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6964"/>From the plank beneath the eaves, as the door of the garret had been left open, S- informed me he heard every word of the following colloquy: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6965"/> </p> 
<p>Where is the guerilla we are after?</p></quote> exclaimed the officer in command, sternly addressing the lady of the house. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6973"/>This command was obeyed by a sergeant, holding an official paper in his hand; and S- had the satisfaction of hearing read aloud a paper which recited his various exploits, commented upon his character in terms far from flattering, declared him a bushwhacker and guerilla, and ordered him to be put to death wherever he was found &mdash; the men being expressly forbidden to take him prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6974"/>This order was from <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>--, commanding the neighbouring force, and S- heard every word of it. He was to be pistoled or sabred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6975"/>No hope of mercyno surrender taken.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6978"/>S-was made of the stuff which does not cower before danger, but enables a man to look the <rs>King</rs> of Terrours in the face without the shudder of a nerve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6979"/>He was armed as usual with <num value="2">two</num> pistols carefully loaded and capped &mdash; for he never neglected his arms-and before he was taken, or rather killed, he hoped to lay low more than <num value="1">one</num> of his assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6980"/>This was his calculation; but the scout was still a long way from regarding his fate as sealed, his death as certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6981"/>He had an obstinate faculty of hoping, and took the brightest view of his critical situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6982"/><pb id="p.488" n="488"/> He might not be discovered; or if discovered, he was in a position to fight to an advantage which would make the issue of the struggle exceedingly doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6983"/>He intended to spring to the door, shoot the <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> men who would probably penetrate to the garret, and hurl them down the staircase-and then placing himself at the head of the stairs, sheltered from bullets by a projection of the wood-work, defy them to ascend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6984"/><quote>They never <hi rend="italics">could</hi> have got me out of there,</quote> said S- with a laugh, <quote>unless they had burned the house, or brought <hi rend="italics">a piece of artillery to shell me out</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6985"/></p> 
<p>But not to digress from the actual <hi rend="italics">res gestoe</hi> of the occasion, the search for S- speedily commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6986"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> the parlour and dining-room were subjected to a rigid examination, and finding there no traces of the scout, the men scattered themselves over the house, ransacking every apartment, and compelling the young ladies to throw open the most private recesses of their chambers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6987"/>They looked under beds, into closets, and behind dresses hanging up in the wardrobes, in vain search for the game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6988"/>Sabres were thrust into beds, to pierce and immolate the dangerous wild animal if he were lying <hi rend="italics">perdu</hi> between the mattresses; and the points of the weapons did not spare the female clothing depending from pegs in the closets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6989"/>The scout might be straightened up against the wall, behind those white garments in closet or wardrobe; but an assiduous search failed to discover him, and soon no portion of the whole esablishment remained unexplored but the garret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6990"/>To this the party now directed their attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6991"/><quote>What room is up there?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6992"/>was the curt question of <num value="1">one</num> of the men to the young lady who stood near him. </p>

<p><quote>You see the way &mdash; I do not wish to go up there; the dust will soil my dress.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6996"/></p> 
<p>A growl greeted these quiet words, and the trooper turned to a black servant-girl who had been made to go around with the party in their search, holding a lighted candle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6997"/><pb id="p.489" n="489"/> </p> 
<p><quote>You go before, and show us the way,</quote> said the trooper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6998"/>The girl laughed, declared that nobody was up there; but on hearing the order repeated, ascended the stairs, followed by the man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6999"/>S-- had listened attentively and lost nothing; the architecture of the house enabling him to catch the least sound without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7000"/>After the protracted search in the rooms beneath, during which his hiding-place had not been approached, he began to hope that the danger was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7001"/>This hope, however, was found to be illusory, and he prepared for the crisis. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7002"/>The steps of the servant-girl were heard ascending, followed by the tramp of the trooper, whose heavy sabre rattled against the stairs as he moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7003"/>Then a long streak of light ran over the garret floor; and cautiously thrusting out his head from his hiding-place, S-saw the head of the girl and her companion, as step by step they mounted to the apartment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7004"/>The girl held up her dress with affected horror of the dust; and when she had reached a position from which a full stream of light could be directed into the room, she paused, and with a low laugh called her companion's attention to the fact that there was nothing whatever in the garret. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7005"/>This, however, did not satisfy him, and he insisted upon making a thorough search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7006"/>The girl was obliged to obey his order, and in a moment they were both standing in the room.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7007"/>S&mdash; measured the man before, or rather beneath him, through a crevice in the plank, and calculated where he could shoot him to the best advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7008"/>This resource seemed all that was left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7009"/>Discovery appeared inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7010"/>The scout was lying upon a single plank, directly over the head of his enemy, and it was only necessary, apparently, for the latter to possess ordinary eyesight to discover him. This was the scout's conviction, as he now cautiously moved his finger to the trigger of the pistol, which he had drawn and cocked, in expectation of the coming struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7011"/>He would certainly be discovered in <measure n="10seconds" type="date">ten seconds</measure>, and then for an exhibition of his prowess as a Confederate soldier <pb id="p.490" n="490"/> and scout, which should either extricate him from his peril, or force his very enemies to respect the courage of the man they overwhelmed and put to death!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7012"/>His plan, as I have said, was simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7013"/>He would throw himself upon this man, shoot him through the heart, hurl the body upon the heads of those below, and then hold his position against the whole party at the pistol's muzzle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7014"/>It was improbable that the <rs>Federal</rs> troopers could be induced to mount the narrow stairway, at the head of which stood at bay a desperate and determined man, armed with a revolver in each hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7015"/>It would be certain death to them; he must either be burned out or shelled out with artillery!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7016"/>That either of these courses, however, would be resorted to, appeared improbable; they would place a guard around the house, and either starve or attempt to dislodge him in some other manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7017"/>But then he would gain time; now if time were only gained, the scout had so much confidence in his own resources that he believed himself safe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7018"/>To return to the scene actually occurring: the <rs>Federal</rs> trooper gazed around the garret for some hidden nook or cranny wherein a rebel could be stowed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7019"/>Some empty boxes attracted his attention, but an examination of them resulted in nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7020"/>Then, all at once, the eyes of the man were directed toward the spot where the scout was concealed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7021"/>S&mdash; gave himself up for lost; his finger was on the trigger, and he was about to forestall his enemy by sending a ball through his brain, when suddenly he drew a long breath, removed his finger from the trigger, and flattened himself almost to nonentity on his plank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7022"/>The girl had adopted an excellent <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi>, and as simple as it was excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7023"/>Whilst conversing carelessly with the man, she had moved <hi rend="italics">directly beneath</hi> S , in consequence of which movement the candle threw the shadow of the plank on which he lay <hi rend="italics">directly upward</hi>. Thus the person of the scout, prone on the plank, was wholly hidden from view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7024"/>In vain did the man move from side to side, evidently suspecting something, and order the girl to hold the light in such a manner as to illuminate the dusky recess beneath the rafters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7025"/>She readily did so, but so adroitly that at every movement the shadow was made still to <pb id="p.491" n="491"/> conceal the scout; and ere long this comedy, in the issue of which the life of a man was involved, came to an end. Satisfied that the garret contained no <num value="1">one</num>, the man retired, and the clank of his sabre on the staircase as he descended gradually receded from the hearing of S . He was saved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7026"/>The Federal troopers remained at the house some time longer, their officer exhibiting the utmost anger and disappointment at the result of the expedition; but they finally departed, warning the lady of the mansion that if she harboured <quote>guerillas</quote> thereafter, her house would be burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7027"/>Leaving videttes behind, the officer then departed with his detachment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7028"/>This was the signal for S&mdash; to descend, which he did at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7029"/>A brief reconnoissance through the window revealed the dark figures posted at stated intervals around the housebut these only made him laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7030"/>He did not fear them, and had only <num value="1">one</num> regret &mdash; the impossibility of getting his horse off. The attempt would reveal his presence, involve the family in danger, and might fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7031"/>He accordingly resolved to retire on foot.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7056"/>S&mdash; had, as I have said, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> companions with him; and having slept in the woods near <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, the party proceeded toward <persName n="Catlett,,,,," id="n0011.0041.00493.02388" reg="mostcommon:Catlett,nomatch:0"><surname>Catlett</surname></persName>'s in search of adventures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7057"/>There were plenty of Federal camps there, and in the neighbourhood; and our scout promised himself much amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7058"/>Behold them then, full of the spirit of fun, and intent on celebrating the day by an exciting hunt which should result in the running down, and killing or capturing of some of the blue people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7059"/>They reached the vicinity of the railroad without adventures, and then proceeded carefully to reconnoitre for the camps known to be in that vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7060"/>This search was soon rewarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7061"/>Reaching the summit of a hill, where some trees concealed them, but the view was unobscured, they perceived in the valley beneath <num value="2">two</num> extensive camps, <num value="1">one</num> on the right, the other on the left; the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers lounging about in careless security. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7062"/>Here was S&mdash;&lsquo;s game plain before him, and waiting as it were to be trapped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7063"/>Stragglers from Federal camps-adventurous explorers of the surrounding country in search of butter, eggs, or fowls-these were the favourite victims of the scout; for <pb id="p.494" n="494"/> from such he often obtained valuable information, excellent horses and equipments, and the finest patterns of revolvers; all <quote>articles in his line.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7064"/>To lie in wait for stragglers or others was thus a very safe game; but on this occasion S- had loftier views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7065"/>He had <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> men with him, tried and trusty comrades; and with an army of this size, he felt himself able to operate in the open field; making up by dash and audacity what he lacked in numbers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7066"/>Having thus arrived at the conclusion that he could effect something important, the scout waited for his opportunity, and this opportunity soon came. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7067"/>All at once a <hi rend="italics">cortege</hi> of cavalry was seen advancing along the road in the valley from <num value="1">one</num> camp in the direction of the other; apparently the escort of some officer of distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7068"/>The party numbered at least <num value="20">twenty</num>, and the ground was unfavourable for a surprise; but S- was unable to resist the temptation to attack them, and at least throw them and their camps into confusion-your true scout and hunter of bluebirds never experiencing greater pleasure than when he can alone, or with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> companions, frighten and startle <quote>to arms</quote> a whole brigade or regiment of his enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7069"/>S&mdash; accordingly stole down the hill, as much under cover as possible, until he reached the side of the road over which the officer and his escort were approaching-then in a few words he explained his design to the others, and awaited. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7070"/>The Federal officer came on in profound security, no doubt considering himself as safe as though at home in his own country; when suddenly, with a yell that rang through the hills, S and his party darted from their place of concealment, and charged full tilt upon the frightened escort, firing on them as they charged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7071"/>The escort did not await the shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7072"/>Believing themselves waylaid by <quote>Rebel cavalry,</quote> and doomed to certain destruction if they remained, they turned their horses' heads and broke in disorder, flying back to the camp from which they came, pursued by S&mdash;&lsquo;s men. <pb id="p.495" n="495"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7073"/>Their commander, a Colonel, acted with more courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7074"/>Shad shot him through the arm, inflicting a dangerous wound; but he attempted to draw his pistol and resist, calling all the time to his cowardly escort to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7075"/>S&mdash; immediately closed in with him and attempted to kill him, but in this he failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7076"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs>'s horse set off at full speed in the direction of the camp, toward which his rider had been going, and, turning his own horse, S&mdash; followed, yelling and firing his pistol as he went. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7077"/>The chase was exciting; the situation altogether singular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7078"/>The camp of a whole brigade was directly in front, not <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards distant</measure>, and S&mdash; was on the heels of the <rs>Colonel</rs>, who was already on the outskirts of the encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7079"/>The men ran from their tents in astonishment and dismay at the firing, persuaded that a whole regiment of <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName> was charging; and still the <rs>Colonel</rs>, like <persName n="Gilpin,,John,,," id="n0011.0041.00495.02389" reg="default:Gilpin,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Gilpin</surname></persName> of old, ran his racenot for <quote>a <measure n="1000l." type="pounds"><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure>,</quote> but for a more valuable stake, his life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7080"/>S&mdash; did not relax his gait or cease pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7081"/>Now they were in the very camp; the <rs>Colonel</rs> still dashes on, and the scout still follows on his track, firing as he goes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7082"/>The <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> gesticulates violently, and shouts to the men: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7083"/> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7086"/>S&mdash; laughs and bangs away still with his revolver. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7087"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> is in a frenzy of rage; his frightened horse shies; the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s hat drops, but the owner cannot stop to regain it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7088"/>S&mdash; throws himself from the saddle, picks up the hat, and again mounts, laughing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7089"/>But by this time the game was growing too dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7090"/>The men had recovered from their astonishment and were running to their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7091"/>S&mdash; had no desire to receive a volley of musketry; and, waving the captured hat with <num value="1">one</num> hand, fired his last barrel with the other at the <rs>Colonel</rs>, and then retreated at a gallop, followed by a number of musket-balls, at which, however, he only laughed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7092"/>He soon rejoined his men, who had pursued the escort into <pb id="p.496" n="496"/> the other camp; and then, as the whole place was buzzing like a nest of hornets, they quietly disappeared and were soon lost in the extensive woods, where pursuit was impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7093"/>What S- did with his hat I am unable to say; but, doubtless, the heart of some <quote>high Confederate</quote> was charmed by the offering, for mighty is the market price of all that comes through the blockade. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7099"/>Mounted on a good fresh horse, with pistols at side, and a good stout heart to back the ready hand, the scout joyfully set forth all alone on his journey, trusting to <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> to guide him, and to his own skill and courage for the result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7100"/>The country swarmed with the enemy; and to find out all about them, their strength, position, and probable designs, was the main object of S-in going on his scout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7102"/>As will be seen, such opportunity did present itself, and was promptly improved. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7103"/>The scout reached, without adventures, the vicinity of <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, and was riding through a thick body of woods, when all at once, on turning a bend in the winding bridle-path, he <pb id="p.498" n="498"/> came suddenly upon a Federal <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, followed by <num value="2">two</num> orderlies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7104"/>The undergrowth was so thick, and the earth so soft, that he was entirely unaware of the vicinity of his foes, until the horses' heads were almost touching. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7105"/>For a moment the opponents gazed upon each other motionless and in silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7106"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> and his escort seemed to have a dim impression that the silent man before them was <hi rend="italics">a foe</hi>, and S- soon gave them good reason fbr becoming confirmed in this opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7107"/>His hand darted to his pistol, but for some moments he was unable to draw it. The <rs>Colonel</rs> was busy doing the same; and, meanwhile, something like the following dialogue took place between the opponents: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7108"/><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, <hi rend="italics">excitedly</hi>.-<quote>You are a guerilla?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7109"/></p> 
<p>scout, <hi rend="italics">sternly</hi>.-<quote>Yes, I am.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7110"/></p> 
<p><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>.-<quote>What do you want?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7111"/></p> 
<p>scout.-<quote>You.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7112"/></p> 
<p>And with these words S-- banged away with his pistol, missing his aim, but causing the <num value="2">two</num> orderlies to beat a sudden and complete retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7113"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> fired his pistol, and then turned his horse's head to retreat, but S-- was too quick for him. In an instant he was beside his man, and ordered him to drop his pistol and surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7114"/>This command was doggedly obeyed; but S&mdash; had no sooner achieved his object than he saw himself threatened with a new danger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7115"/>Horses' hoofs were heard upon the road behind him; and looking through an opening in the trees, he saw a party of Federal cavalry, who had no doubt been attracted by the report of his pistol, and were now approaching the spot at a rapid gallop, evidently bent on ascertaining the cause of the firing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7116"/>Not a moment was to be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7117"/>S&mdash; saw his prize about to be snatched from him, and was called upon to act with rapidity and resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7118"/>Cocking his pistol, which he held in his right hand, he ordered his prisoner to refrain from any outcry on peril of instant death; and then seizing the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s bridle in his left hand, he put spur to his horse and set off at a tremendous gallop &mdash; the prisoner's horse galloping beside his own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7119"/>Thus commenced the race for life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7120"/>The pursuers had evidently <pb id="p.499" n="499"/> described him and comprehended his intention, for they uttered loud shouts, calling on him to stop or they would fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7121"/>The scout laughed his grim laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7122"/>It was probable that such a threat would influence him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7123"/>He had long cultivated a contempt for bullets issuing from carbines levelled by cavalry; and if the coolest and most experienced marksmen, firing from a rest, had menaced him, the effect would have been the same with him. Even if his soul had not scouted the thought, <hi rend="italics">surrender</hi> was out of the question; and, instead of slackening his gait, he put spurs to his horse, flying even faster, and carrying along with him the <rs>Colonel</rs>, whose bridle was still grasped in his inexorable hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7124"/>The pursuers howled with rage and followed like wolves upon his track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7125"/>Every moment they seemed gaining on him, and the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s countenance began to indicate a lively anticipation of rescue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7126"/>But to aid his friends seemed hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7127"/>S&mdash; had him completely in his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7128"/>Whenever he turned his eyes toward the scout as they sped on, the grim muzzle of a pistol met his view; and the expression of the scout's countenance but too plainly proved that he would hesitate at nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7129"/>If anything was certain, this was, that S&mdash; had determined to bring him out of the lines a prisoner, or leave him dead; and the <rs>Colonel</rs>, like an intelligent man, did not venture to raise his hand, or make any open efforts to assist his friends and effect his release. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7130"/>The pursuers still thundered on the track of the scout and his prisoner; and the <num value="2">two</num> horsemen continued to fly at headlong speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7131"/>They passed out of the woods across an open space, and into the woods again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7132"/>All trace of a road, except a narrow bridlepath, was now lost, and the trunks of the trees grew so close together that it was difficult for the pursuers to follow them except in single file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7133"/>This it was soon obvious they were doing, for the shouts were again close upon the track of the fugitives; and the near approach of his friends induced the prisoner to undertake a <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi> on his own part, to assist them in their exertions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7134"/>This he proceeded to do as follows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7135"/>The wood, as I have said, was very dense, and the trees so close together as to make it difficult for S and his companion to pass along the narrow bridle-path abreast between the trunks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7136"/>On this circumstance the <pb id="p.500" n="500"/> <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> based his hopes of delaying the flight of himself and S&mdash; , and thus giving time to his friends to come up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7137"/>They were passing at this moment through a very narrow space; there was scarce room for more than a single horse; and on the side of the <rs>Colonel</rs>, that is, the left side, a stout tree-trunk made it necessary to incline his horse's head to the right, and draw in his knee well to the saddle, to avoid scaping against the trunk in passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7138"/>It was the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s object now to pass to the <hi rend="italics">left</hi> of this tree; and then force S&mdash; , as he passed on the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> of it, to loose his hold of the prisoner's bridle, who might then suddenly check his horse, wheel round, and so escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7139"/>No sooner was this <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi> determined on than it was attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7140"/>By violently turning his horse's head to the left, and digging his right heel into the animal's flanks, the <rs>Federal</rs> officer endeavoured to interpose the tree between them, and so accomplish his purpose; but S&mdash; was too quick for him. The scout was not <num value="1">one</num> to be outgeneralled by so simple and transparent a device.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7141"/>No sooner had the <rs>Colonel</rs> jerked his bridle to the left, than the scout counteracted his plan by still more violently jerking it toward himself, and forcing the animal to dart by <hi rend="italics">between</hi> himself and the tree, instead of upon the opposite side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7142"/>The consequence was, that the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s knee crashed against the trunk; his foot was dragged out of the stirrup, and his boot nearly torn from his leg, which was painfully bruised and lacerated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7143"/>He had no sooner regained his seat in the saddle than the low tones of S&mdash; , supported by a levelled pistol, were heard warning him that a repetition of that manoeuvre, or any attempt to escape whatever, would be followed by his instant death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7144"/>Having communicated this warning with an accent of voice that satisfied the listener that the speaker was ready, and even desirous to carry out his threat, S&mdash; again darted on, still followed by the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7145"/>No further effort was made by the prisoner to escape, and the pursuers began gradually to relax the ardour of the chase; but all at once a new danger presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7146"/>Directly in front of them was a large camp; and to S&mdash;&lsquo;s rapid questions, the <rs>Colonel</rs> <pb id="p.501" n="501"/> replied that the camp before them was <hi rend="italics">his own</hi>. Realize now, reader, the full comedy of the <quote>situation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7147"/>S --was charging at a thundering gallop the camp of a full Federal regiment, with scores of the men lounging about the opening of the tents; and by his side, a prisoner, was the <rs>Colonel</rs> of the regiment, charging, somewhat unwillingly, with his captor!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7148"/>This is not the fancy of a romance-writer, inventing the odd contrasts of comedy for the amusement of his readers, but an occurrence which really took place just as is here stated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7149"/>The scout was, however, equal to the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7150"/>Not only did he unhesitatingly charge <hi rend="italics">upon</hi> the camp, but <hi rend="italics">through</hi> it. No other course was left; but even if the choice had been possible, this &mdash; the boldest &mdash; was the safest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7151"/>It was necessary to take the enemy completely by surprise; and having informed his prisoner that at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> outcry which he made, a pistol bullet would be sent through his heart, he dug the spur into his horse's side, dragged his companion on, and before the thoughtless loungers of the camp realized the truth, had darted through unopposed, and was racing with his prisoner far beyond pursuit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7152"/>Once in the woods again, S- was comparatively safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7153"/>There was no cavalry near, and the slow infantry could not follow the rough rider and his captive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7154"/>To the latter S- now coolly turned, and demanded his name and regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7155"/>The reply was a sullen refusal to give the required information, and the scout saw that <quote>coercion</quote> was absolutely necessary to attain his object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7156"/>He accordingly crossed the pistol which he held in his right hand in front of his breast, covered the prisoner's heart, and said politely: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7157"/> </p> 
<p><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, I asked you your name, and the number and State of your regiment.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7158"/><quote>I refused to give it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7159"/></p> 
<p><quote>If you do not, I will kill you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7160"/></p> 
<p>This response admitted of no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7161"/>The officer looked at his captor, saw that he was quite in earnest, and replied: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7162"/> </p> 
<p>My name is <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> &mdash; , and my regiment is the--<placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7163"/><quote>All right, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>; I see we understand each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7164"/>Now I <pb id="p.502" n="502"/> wish you would tell me anything you know that will interest me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7165"/></p> 
<p>And laughing in his low fashion, the scout rode on with his prisoner, whose good-humour gradually began to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7166"/>To explain this, it may be conjectured that S&mdash; had not upon this occasion encountered a very desperate son of <persName n="Mars,,,,," id="n0011.0042.00502.02390" reg="mostcommon:Mars,nomatch:0"><surname>Mars</surname></persName>, but a philosopher who contemplated the probabilities of an early exchange, and submitted gracefully to his fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7167"/>In an hour the scout and his prisoner had become quite sociable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7168"/><quote>That was a daring act of yours,</quote> said the <rs>Colonel</rs>, <quote>and you have got out of this thing well.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7169"/></p> 
<p><quote>I rather think so, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7170"/></p> 
<p><quote>I ought to have been more on my guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7171"/>Well done-yes, very well done; especially going through my camp!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7172"/></p> 
<p>It will be seen that the <num value="2">two</num> had grown quite friendly, and this amicable understanding continued uninterrupted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7173"/>S-- had long since returned'to the black leather holster that impolite instrument <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> directed at his companion's breast, and they rode on together in the friendliest manner imaginable, still keeping in the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7174"/>Night thus surprised them; and no house being visible, a proceeding took place which will seem to display the <hi rend="italics">entente cordiale</hi> between S&mdash; and his companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7175"/>They were both sleepy; they determined to bivouac; and the scout simply took his prisoner's parole not to attempt escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7176"/><measure n="5minutes" type="date">Five minutes</measure> afterwards they were sleeping side by side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7177"/>Rising at daylight, they proceeded on their way, and in a few hours S&mdash; was within the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines with his prisoner. </p></div1>

<head>An adventure with the <quote>Bluebirds.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7178"/></head> 
<p>S&mdash; is a scout who has had many very curious adventures, as the narratives already laid before the reader will serve to show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7179"/>He is not a <quote>man of peace,</quote> nor is his life a tranquil <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7180"/>While you, my dear quiet citizen, have been sleeping in your comfortable bed, with the curtains drawn and the firelight shining on <placeName key="tgn,7007868" n="1.000 1" reg="bruxelles,bruxelles,belgie,europe">Brussels</placeName> carpeting and mahogany furniture, or luxuriously stretching out your slippered feet toward the fender in the breakfast-room, as you glance over the morning papers before going to your cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7182"/>employments down town; while you have been thus agreeably engaged, not knowing what it is to wear a soiled shirt or miss a meal, or suffer from cold or fatigue, S-has been in the saddle, hungry, weary, exposed to rain and snow and storm, hunting Bluebirds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7183"/>Bluebird hunting is not a remunerative employment in a pecuniary point of view, but it has its attractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7184"/>You don't realize a <num value="1">hundred per cent.</num> profit, and you run some risk; but the blood flows faster and much more gloriously through the veins than in trade, to say nothing of the <quote>fuller life</quote> it communicates to all the faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7185"/>But this is not denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7186"/>I proceed to give a brief account of a recent scout which S-- made into the <rs>Federal</rs> lines: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7187"/><num value="1">One</num> fine summer day in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> he took <num value="4">four</num> men, made his way unperceived across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and soon reached <pb id="p.504" n="504"/> the neighbourhood of <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7188"/>Leaving that place to his left, he struck out with his party for the railroad, and coming near a Federal camp, placed his <num value="4">four</num> men in ambush, and taking a position on the road, awaited the appearance of some prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7189"/>He had not waited long when a stray Federal cavalry-man came along, and seeing S &mdash; dressed in a blue overcoat and Federal accoutrements generally, had no fear of him. His confiding simplicity was his ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7190"/>When he had come within a few yards S&mdash; <quote>put his pistol on him,</quote> in military parlance, and took him prisoner, calling <num value="1">one</num> of his men from the woods to take charge of him. The captive had scarcely been conducted into the underwood when <num value="2">two</num> others appeared, coming from the same direction, and S&mdash; determined to capture these also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7191"/>He called to the man who had taken charge of the prisoner; but that worthy was too busy rifling the unfortunate bluebird, and did not hear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7192"/>S-then resolved to capture the <num value="2">two</num> new cavalrymen by himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7193"/>He accordingly advanced toward them, when suddenly another came out of the woods and joined them, making <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7194"/>He still designed attacking them, when another appeared, making <num value="4">four</num>; and as these now approached S&mdash; they suddenly drew their pistols, and levelling them, ordered him to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7195"/>He was within <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> of them, holding his pistol in his hand, and said coolly: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7228"/>If he was conducted to the picket he knew that his real character would be discovered, his fate to be a stout rope and a short shrift, and that his body would soon be dangling from a tree as a warning to all spies.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7230"/>He then turned his horse and dashed back until he was opposite the point where his men were concealed, when he wheeled round, and they all stopped suddenly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7231"/>S&mdash; coolly crossed his <pb id="p.506" n="506"/> leg over the pommel of his saddle, covered them with his pistol, and said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7474"/>We proceed to record the incident which we have referred to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7475"/>It occurred, as we have said, in <dateStruct value="1864-11-"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, and the scene was a mansion perched upon a hill, with a background of woods, between the little village of <placeName reg="Millwood, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2113037">Millwood</placeName> and the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7476"/>This house was well known to <persName n="Mosby,,,,," id="n0011.0046.00526.02483" reg="mostcommon:Mosby,Jack,,,:1"><surname>Mosby</surname></persName>, well known to many hundreds of Confederate soldiers, who-<name n="God" type="God">God</name> be thanked! --never left its door without food, without receiving all that it was in the power of the family to give them, and that without money and without price. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7477"/>A day or <num value="2">two</num> before the incident about to be related, <persName n="Mountjoy,,,,," id="n0011.0046.00526.02484" reg="mostcommon:Mountjoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Mountjoy</surname></persName> had gone with a considerable party of men, towards <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>; had made an attack; secured numerous horses and prisoners; and on this afternoon was returning towards Millwoodonly by the river road &mdash; to cross the <rs>Shenandoah</rs> at <persName n="Berry,,,,," id="n0011.0046.00526.02485" reg="mostcommon:Berry,nomatch:0"><surname>Berry</surname></persName>'s ferry, <pb id="p.527" n="527"/> and secure his captures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7479"/>On this occasion he was rash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7480"/>As he returned from his scout, and arrived opposite the different fords, he permitted, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num>, then another, then whole squads of his men to cross to their homes east of the <rs type="place">Ridge</rs>, so that on reaching a point nearly opposite <placeName key="tgn,2113037" n="1.000 11" reg="millwood, clarke, virginia">Millwood</placeName>, he had with him only <num value="15">fifteen</num> men guarding the numerous horses and prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7481"/>Then came the hostile fate-close on his heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7482"/>The attack made by him upon the enemy down the river had greatly enraged them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7483"/>They had hastily mustered a considerable force to pursue him and recapture the prisoners, and as he reached <placeName reg="Morgan's Lane">Morgan's Lane</placeName>, near the <rs>Tilthammer Mill</rs>, this party, about <num value="100">one hundred</num> in number, made a sudden and unexpected attack upon him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7484"/>The force was too great to meet front to front, and the ground so unfavourable for receiving their assault, that <persName n="Mountjoy,,,,," id="n0011.0046.00527.02487" reg="mostcommon:Mountjoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Mountjoy</surname></persName> gave the order for his men to save themselves, and they abandoned the prisoners and horses, put spurs to their animals, and retreated at full gallop past the mill, across a little stream, and up the long hill upon which was situated the mansion above referred to. Behind them the <num value="100">one hundred</num> Federal cavalrymen came on at full gallop, calling upon them to halt, and firing volleys into them as they retreated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7485"/>We beg now to introduce upon the scene the female <hi rend="italics">dramatis personce</hi> of the incident-<num value="2">two</num> young ladies who had hastened out to the fence as soon as the firing began, and now witnessed the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7486"/>As they reached the fence, the <num value="15">fifteen</num> men of <persName n="Mountjoy,Captain,,,," id="n0011.0046.00527.02488" reg="mostcommon:Mountjoy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mountjoy</surname></persName> appeared, mounting the steep road like lightning, closely pursued by the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry, whose dense masses completely filled the narrow road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7487"/>The scene at the moment was sufficient to try the nerves of the young ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7488"/>The clash of hoofs, the crack of carbines, the loud cries of <quote>halt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7489"/>halt!! halt!!!</quote> --this tramping, shouting, banging, to say nothing of the quick hiss of bullets filling the air, rendered the <quote>place and time</quote> more stirring than agreeable to <num value="1">one</num> consulting the dictates of a prudent regard to his or her safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7490"/>Nevertheless, the young ladies did not stir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7491"/>They had half mounted the board fence, and in this elevated position were <pb id="p.528" n="528"/> exposed to a close and dangerous fire; more than <num value="1">one</num> bullet burying itself in the wood close to their persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7492"/>But they did not move-and this for a reason more creditable than mere curiosity to witness the engagement, which may, however, have counted for something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7493"/>This attracted them, but they were engaged in <quote>doing good</quote> too!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7494"/>It was of the last importance that the men should know where they could cross the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7495"/><quote>Where is the nearest ford?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7496"/>they shouted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7501"/></p> 
<p>And waving her hand, the speaker directed the rest, amid a storm of bullets burrying themselves in the fence close beside her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7502"/>The men went at full gallop towards the ford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7503"/>Last of all came Mountjoy-but <persName n="Mountjoy,,,,," id="n0011.0046.00528.02489" reg="mostcommon:Mountjoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Mountjoy</surname></persName>, furious, foaming almost at the mouth, on fire with indignation, and uttering oaths so frightful that they terrified the young ladies much more than the balls, or the <rs>Federal</rs> calvary darting up the hill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7504"/>Let us here, in parenthesis, as it were, offer a proof of that high-breeding we have claimed for <persName n="Mountjoy,Captain,,,," id="n0011.0046.00528.02490" reg="mostcommon:Mountjoy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mountjoy</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7505"/>A young lady expressed afterwards her regret that so brave a gentleman should have uttered an oath, and this came to his ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7506"/>He at once called to see her and said gravely, in his calm, sad voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7507"/><quote>I am sorry that I swore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7508"/>I will try not to do so again, but I was very angry that day, as the men might have whipped the enemy in spite of their numbers, if I could only have gotten them to make a stand, and this was before <hi rend="italics">you.</hi></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7509"/>But that was when his blood was cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7511"/>Nevertheless he stopped in the very face of the enemy, besought the young ladies to leave the fence where they were exposing themselves to imminent danger, and then, still furious, he disappeared, most of all enraged, as he afterwards explained, that this stampede of his men and himself should have taken place in the presence of the young ladies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7512"/>The partisan had scarcely disappeared in the woods, when the <pb id="p.529" n="529"/> enemy rushed up, and demanded which way the <rs>Confederates</rs> had taken. </p>

<p>The scene which followed has more than once been described to the present writer, and it made a dolorous impression on his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7543"/>The wounded man lay upon the couch, struggling against death, writhing with his great agony, and bleeding so profusely that the couch was saturated with his blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7549"/>Unable to undo the belt, the young lady quickly drew the pistol from its holster, secreted it in a closet, and turning round, saw that in this moment the dying man had rolled from the couch upon the floor, where he was exclaiming: <quote><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, have pity upon me!</quote>

<p>She hastened back to him, and at the same instant the house was literally crowded suddenly with Federal soldiers, who burst open the doors, tore the ornaments from the mantelpiece, broke everything which they could lay their hands upon, and exhibited violent rage at the escape of the <rs>Confederates</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7576"/>He still held the hand of the young lady who had removed his pistol; to this he clung with an unrelaxing clutch; and the sight of her tearful face, as she knelt beside him, seemed to afford him the only satisfaction of which he was capable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7604"/>At nightfall the <rs>Federal</rs> troops had torn the house to pieces, taken all which they could not destroy, and had vanished.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7606"/>Then a strange and unexpected difficulty arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7607"/>It is safe to say that the young ladies of New York or <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, at that moment buried in slumbers in their happy homes, surrounded by every comfort &mdash; it is safe to say that they would have found it difficult then &mdash; will find it difficult now &mdash; to conceive even the great dilemma which their young rebel <quote>sisters</quote> were called upon to face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7608"/>The death of a friend would have been sad to the young <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName> or Philadelphian, but at least they would have seen his body deposited in a rosewood coffin; the head would have rested on its satin cushion; lace handkerchiefs raised to streaming eyes, in the long procession of brilliant equipages, would have been soothing to his friends, as indicating the general grief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7609"/>Here, in that good or bad year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, on the border, things were different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7610"/>There were no equipages &mdash; no lace handkerchiefs --no satin, and rosewood, and silver &mdash; not even a coffin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7611"/>In the midst of their grief for the loss of that brave soldier of <num value="1">one</num> of the old <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> families, their connexions, the young Confederate girls were met by this sudden obstacle-by this gross, material question, this brutal difficulty &mdash; where shall a coffin for the dead be procured?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7612"/>There lay the dead body pale, cold, terrible-how bury it as Christians bury their dead? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7613"/>They did not cry or complain, but courageously set to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7614"/>Beside themselves, there were in the house <num value="2">two</num> young cousins now, who had hastened to the place, <persName n="Phil,,,,," id="n0011.0046.00533.02503" reg="mostcommon:Phil,nomatch:0"><surname>Phil</surname></persName> &mdash; and <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName> &mdash; , at that time mere boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7615"/>These went to the mill, past which <persName n="Mountjoy,,,,," id="n0011.0046.00533.02504" reg="mostcommon:Mountjoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Mountjoy</surname></persName> had retreated, and painfully raising upon their shoulders some broad and heavy planks lying there, bore them up the hill to the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7616"/>Then, accompanied by the youngest of the girls, they went to an old saw-mill near the river, gathered together a number of rails from old timber there, returned, and began their lugubrious work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7617"/><pb id="p.534" n="534"/> </p> 
<p>The details of their employment were as sombre as the employment itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7618"/>The dead body was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be measured; and this was courageously undertaken by the youngest girl, who, placing <num value="1">one</num> end of a cord upon the dead man's forehead, measured to his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7619"/>The length was thus determined, and the boys set to work, assisted by the girl, sawing, hammering, and nailing together the rude box which was to contain all that remained of the poor youth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7620"/>The work absorbed them throughout the short <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> day, and only at nightfall was it finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7621"/>Then the fear seized upon them that they had made the coffin too long; that the corpse would not lie securely in it, and move when carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7622"/>A singular means of testing the length of the coffin was suddenly hit upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7623"/>The eldest of the young ladies, who had been watching the corpse during the work, now approached, and without shrinking, lay at full length in the coffin, which was then found to be amply large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7624"/>Then the body was deposited in it &mdash; the p16us toil had been accomplished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7625"/>Was not that painfully in contrast with the decent city <quote>arrangements,</quote> which take from the mourner all the gross details --permitting his grief to hover serenely in the region of sentiment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7627"/>It consisted of <num value="300">three hundred</num> horsemen, silent, muffled, and armed to the teeth, for the enemy were close by in heavy force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7956"/>He had fought as long as he could, and done all in his power to extricate his army from a position in which it had been placed by no fault of his. Now he did not hesitate in his course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7957"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he had recoiled from the idea of surrender when it was suggested to him by, I think, <persName n="Pendelton,General,,,," id="n0011.0048.00560.02664" reg="mostcommon:Pendelton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pendelton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7960"/>Now the current had set too strongly against him, and he was forced to yield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7966"/>Strange, incredible announcement! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7967"/>The effect which it produced upon the troops is hard to describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7968"/>They seemed to be stupefied and wholly unable to realize the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7969"/>For <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0048.00561.02671" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Custis,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, the invincible, to yield up his sword was an incredible thing; and when the troops could no longer have any doubt, men who had fought in <num value="20">twenty</num> battles, and faced death with unshrinking nerve, cried like children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7970"/>To yield is a terrible thing &mdash; a bitter humiliation; and if the private soldiers felt it so keenly, we may imagine the feelings of the leader who was thus called upon to write that word <quote>Surrender</quote> at the end of so great a career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7971"/>He had said once that he <quote>intended for himself to die sword in hand;</quote> but now not even this was permitted him. He must sacrifice his men or surrender, and he decided without difficulty or hesitation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7972"/>If there are any poor creatures so mean as to chuckle at this spectacle of a great man letting fall the sword which has never been stained by bad faith or dishonour, they can indulge their merriment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7974"/>The scenes which took place between <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0011.0048.00561.02672" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his men were indescribably pathetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7975"/>I shall not speak of them, except to <pb id="p.562" n="562"/> say that the great heart of the soldier seemed moved to its depths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7976"/>He who had so long looked unmoved upon good fortune and bad, and kept, in the midst of disaster and impending ruin, the equanimity of a great and powerful soul, now shed tears like a child. </p>

<p>It may be asked why I have omitted from my sketch the scene of surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7979"/>There was no such scene, except afterwards when the troops stacked arms and marched off. The real surrender was an event which was felt, not seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7980"/>It was nothing apparently; the mere appearance of a Federal column waving a white flag, and halting on a distant hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7981"/>But the tragic event was read in the faces of all. No guns in position with that column so near; no line of battle; no preparations for action!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7982"/>A dreamy, memorial sadness seemed to descend through the <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> air and change the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7983"/>Silence so deep that the rustle of the leaves could be heard --and <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0011.0048.00562.02673" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s veterans, who had steadily advanced to attack, moved back like mourners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7984"/>There was nothing visible in front but that distant column, stationary behind its white flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7985"/>No band played, no cheer was heard; the feelings of the <rs>Southern</rs> troops were spared; but there were many who wanted to die then. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7986"/>This retreat was a terrible episode of military life, unlike any which the present writer ever before saw; but he does not regret having borne his part in its hardships, its sufferings, and its humiliations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7987"/>He is glad to have seen the struggle out under <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0011.0048.00562.02674" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Custis,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and to have shared his fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7989"/>He had done his best, and accepted his fate with manly courage, and that erect brow which dares destiny to do her worst; or rather, let us say, he had bowed submissively to the decree of that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in whom he had ever placed his reliance.
