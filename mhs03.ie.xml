<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">Forasmuch as the good education of children is of singular behoof and benefit to any commonwealth, and whereas many parents and masters are too indulgent and negligent of their duty in that kind</q> the selectmen of every town were directed by the law of <dateStruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></dateStruct> to have <q direct="unspecified">a vigilant eye</q> over their neighbors, to see to it that the education of the children be not neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The law of <dateStruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></dateStruct> made it obligatory on towns of <num value="50">fifty</num> families to maintain elementary schools, where children should be taught to read and write, and those of <num value="100">one hundred</num> families should also have a grammar school, <q direct="unspecified">the masters thereof being able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the university.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/></p> 
<p>Good citizenship was then as now <num value="1">one</num> of the great aims of the public school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The idea of what constituted this was explained by our ancestors in the preamble just quoted, and the law of <dateStruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></dateStruct> adds a further explanation, as follows: <q direct="unspecified">It being <num value="1">one</num> chief project of Satan to keep men from the knowledge of the <name>Scripture</name>, as in former times keeping them in unknown tongues, so in these latter times by persuading from the use of tongues, that so at least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded and corrupted with false glosses of deceivers; to the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the <rs>Lord</rs> assisting our endeavors: It is therefore ordered by the court and authority <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> thereof,</q> etc. The penalty on the towns for nonful-filment of the law requiring an elementary school in towns of <num value="50">fifty</num> families and a grammar school in those having <num value="100">one hundred</num> was placed at <measure n="5l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure> in <dateStruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></dateStruct>, but increased to <measure n="10l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> in <dateStruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></dateStruct>, and again to <measure n="20l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> in <dateStruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The grammar school thus established must not be confounded with our present application of the term, but it is the use still prevailing in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and was the <num value="1">one</num> contemplated by the law, that is, it is what we know as a <orgName n="Latin School" type="school">Latin School</orgName> or a <orgName n="High School" type="school">High School</orgName> that prepares pupils for the university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Upon the list of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> taxpayers for the <name>Province</name> rate of <measure n="12l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="12">12</num></measure>-16s levied <dateStruct value="1719-10-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="10">Oct.</month>, <year>1719</year>,</dateStruct> while the inhabitants were agitating the question of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school, were the names of <num value="70">seventy</num> taxpayers, so that we may fairly infer that if <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> was not actually compelled to support an elementary school at this time she had about reached that limit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The establishment of that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school is so important, so interesting, as well as so characteristic of the way town business was transacted in those early days, that the whole evidence regarding it is here presented, even though some of it has been given before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The people of <dateStruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></dateStruct> did not suddenly rouse themselves to the idea of teaching their children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Probably most of them could read and write already, receiving the instruction either in the home or in the neighboring town of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>That such a proposition as establishing a school in the town was not an entirely new thought to the people is evident from <num value="1">one</num> of the votes about building a meeting-house, passed at a town-meeting held <dateStruct value="1691-11-30"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg="30">30</day>, <year reg="1691">1691</year></dateStruct>, which reads: <q direct="unspecified">At A meeting of the <name>Inhabitants</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> voted that <persName n="Hall,Mister,John,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00002" reg="default:Hall,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Hall</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Sen.</rs> and <persName n="Tufts,Captain,Peter,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00003" reg="default:Tufts,Peter,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Peter</foreName> <surname>Tufts</surname></persName> shall intreat <persName n="Wade,,Mada,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00004" reg="default:Wade,Mada,,,"><foreName>Mada</foreName> <surname>Wade</surname></persName> and the overseer of maior Jonathan Wades farme for <num value="1">one</num> quarter of an acre of land for the erecting and setting a meeting house near or upon the <name>Land</name> that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> maior formerly appointed for a Schoole house that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> meadford may injoy for their <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> publick house.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Thus <num value="1">one</num> citizen, at least, had previous to the year <dateStruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></dateStruct> given some thought to the establishment of a school, though there is no evidence that the town ever took any action upon the matter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>There were at this time only <num value="28">twenty eight</num> names on the tax list, so a school was not compulsory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Nothing further appears about a school for nearly <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure>, the meeting-house question probably filling the minds and emptying the pockets of the people so that there was no chance for school or school-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The meeting-house, the agitation for which was here begun, was completed in <dateStruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></dateStruct>; but no mention is made of a school till <dateStruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></dateStruct>, when, as before mentioned, the number of householders probably necessitated action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><dateStruct value="1719-07-10"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="10">10</day>, <year reg="1719">1719</year></dateStruct>, in the warrant calling a town meeting for the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> was an article <q direct="unspecified">to consider what may be proper to be <persName><foreName>Don</foreName></persName> in order to Setting up a <orgName n="Writing School" type="school">writing school</orgName> in S<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Town.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The voters assembled on the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> and adjourned to the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num>, without coming to a vote on the matter, though we can scarcely believe that so important and really revolutionary a matter did not receive full discussion on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="2">15th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But on the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> it was <q direct="unspecified">put to vote whether the <rs type="place">Town</rs> will have some meet person to keep a <orgName n="Writing School" type="school">writing school</orgName> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Town for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winter season,</q> and passed; and next, <q direct="unspecified">Att s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> meeting putt to vote whether the <rs type="place">Town</rs> will choose a Commity of <num value="5">five</num> men to treet with some meet person or persons to keep a <orgName n="Writing School" type="school">writing school</orgName> in the town as aformentioned.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The committee took time enough to give the subject careful consideration, for not until <dateStruct value="-11-13"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="13">13</day></dateStruct> was the warrant issued for a town-meeting to hear the report of this committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The voters assembled <dateStruct value="1719-11-30"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg="30">30</day>, <year reg="1719">1719</year></dateStruct>, but the committee had evidently come to no agreement, <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> for no <q direct="unspecified">meet person</q> was brought forward for the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But the inhabitants voted to have the school kept the ensuing winter at the house of <persName n="Willis,,Thomas,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00012" reg="default:Willis,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Willis</surname>, <genName n="junior">Jr.</genName></persName>, which was probably situated not far from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting-house, near the junction of <address><street n="Woburn Street">Woburn</street></address> and <address><street n="High Street">High</street></address> streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A committee of <num value="3">three</num>, <persName n="Bradshaw,Ensign,John,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00013" reg="default:Bradshaw,John,,,"><roleName n="Ensign">Ensign</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bradshaw</surname></persName>, <persName n="Brooks,Captain,Ebenezer,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00014" reg="default:Brooks,Ebenezer,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Ebenezer</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Willis,,John,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00015" reg="default:Willis,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Willis</surname></persName>, was appointed to secure a teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In considering the location of this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school, and also of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school-house, we must bear in mind that that part of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> known as Symmes Corner belonged to <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 11" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, that there were families residing there, and on <address><street n="Grove street">Grove street</street></address>, and that east of the <rs type="place">Square</rs> there were very few residents, so that this location for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school was undoubtedly near the centre of population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <persName n="Wade,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00016" reg="nearbymention:Wade,Mada,,,"><surname>Wade</surname></persName> property, and the lot of land that the major had <q direct="unspecified">appointed for a school house,</q> was probably too far to the east to suit the majority of the voters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>As we read farther in the records we see stronger and stronger evidence of the tendency of the <name>east</name> and <name>west</name> ends of the town to pull in opposite directions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At the next meeting of the town, <dateStruct value="1719-12-11"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg="11">11</day>, <year reg="1719">1719</year></dateStruct>, the voters chose, undoubtedly on the recommendation of this committee of <num value="3">three</num>, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Davison,Mister,Henery,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00017" reg="default:Davison,Henery,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Henery</foreName> <surname>Davison</surname></persName>, to keep a school in said Town for <num value="1">one</num> q<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of a year next ensuing.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The whole record of this meeting of <dateStruct value="1719-12-11"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg="11">11</day>, <year reg="1719">1719</year></dateStruct>, is interesting and valuable, showing how minutely the voters scrutinized every act and how cautiously they took each step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school-master had been chosen, <q direct="unspecified">Att said meeting put to vote whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town will alow <persName n="Davison,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00018" reg="nearbymention:Davison,Henery,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davison</surname></persName> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sume of <num value="3">Three</num> Pound money for keepin school the time above s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and also to diet him for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> term above said,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Voted for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afft.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The meeting then proceeded to appoint <persName n="Tufts,Mister,Thomas,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00028" reg="default:Tufts,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Tufts</surname></persName> and <persName n="Brooks,Captain,Ebenezer,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00029" reg="default:Brooks,Ebenezer,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Ebenezer</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> (<num value="1">one</num> from each end of the town, as was very fitting) to collect the subscription in accordance with their previous vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Whether this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school was thus paid for can be simply a matter of inference, but the absence of any tax levy for this purpose leads us to suppose that the subscription was successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Whenever the town found it necessary to raise money for the minister's salary, for the province tax, or for any other purpose, it was made out in a separate rate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This <num value="8">eight</num>-pound levy that was voted appears nowhere on the record, so that the inference seems fair that <persName n="Tufts,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00030" reg="nearbymention:Tufts,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tufts</surname></persName> and <persName n="Brooks,Captain,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00031" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Ebenezer,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> were sufficiently persuasive to render it unnecessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Thus was our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school established, called in the vote of the town a <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="Writing School" type="school">writing school</orgName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But the name signified little, for it was probably <num value="1">one</num> of those elementary schools of the olden time which aimed to teach simply the <q direct="unspecified"><num value="3">three</num> R's.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In the later votes of the town it is mentioned as a <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="Writing School" type="school">writing school</orgName>,</q> as a <q direct="unspecified">writing and reading school,</q> as a <q direct="unspecified">reading school,</q> and also as a <q direct="unspecified">reading, writing and ciphering school,</q> the only reason so far as I can see for giving it any name at all being to <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> indicate its elementary nature and to differentiate it from a grammar school as understood in those days.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step had been taken and the school launched, the people began to agitate the school-house question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>It is possible that the old tax of <measure n="3d." type="currency"><num value="3">three</num> pence</measure> per week which the town decided in <dateStruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></dateStruct>, <q direct="unspecified">that those persons that send there children or servants to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Scoole</q> should pay was still enforced to meet the ordinary running expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>However the payment had been made before, henceforth the expense was borne by the town, and each year the only duties of the <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school committee</orgName> are to select a teacher and procure wood.

<p>How long the action of the committee of <dateStruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></dateStruct> giving the girls opportunity for instruction remained in force we cannot tell, but it must have fallen into disuse either through lack of patronage or unwillingness on the part of the teachers to teach girls, for we find that on <dateStruct value="1787-04-02"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="2">2</day>, <year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, the town found it necessary to vote <q direct="unspecified">that the <rs>Committee</rs> that provides a School master be desired to see what he will ask to keep the <name>Girls</name> <num value="1">one</num> Hour in the forenoon and <num value="1">one</num> Hour in the afternoon for <measure n="4Months" type="date">four Months</measure> &amp; Report at <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> meeting.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>The roof was a single pitch, running from the eaves of the old building down to the height of a single story on the back or west side (see This is the old familiar style so common in those days, and known as a leanto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num></hi>, I will refer to the window already spoken of in the south elevation that shows just above the roof of the porch, a part of which was originally below the roof of this porch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>It will also be noticed that this lower window has a straight head, while those above have segment-heads, thus indicating a different period of construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>The probabilities are that this lower window was placed on <num value="1">one</num> side of the stairway, so as to throw as much light as possible into the room under the roof of the leanto, while at the time the windows in the stories above were constructed no <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> such reason for thus lighting the chambers existed, as they had plenty of light from the rear or courtyard side of the building, and they were therefore placed near the centre of the stairway so as to light both the upper and lower parts of the same.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> step in the evolution of this building consisted in raising the east slope of the roof (see C, south end) so as to give an additional elevation to the east or front wall of the building, and to allow of upright windows in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story, giving the front of the building its present appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>There are marks on the east side of the southwest chimney that would seem to indicate that the pitch of the roof was as shown in the drawing, that is, at a right angle with that of the main building (see a, sketch).

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>Standing to the left and slightly in the rear of the mansion house is a building familiarly known as the <q direct="unspecified">slave quarters.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>This building, like its more aristocratic neighbor, has been evolved from a very small beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step in its evolution was a brick and wooden building <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> in width, its length unknown (from <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> an examination of the south foundation wall it appears to have been about <measure n="11feet" type="distance">eleven feet</measure>, see b, sketch), <num value="1">one</num> story in height, the west wall only being of brick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>The chimney was built against and into this west wall, and what is believed to be a portion of this chimney can be seen above the roof of the present building (see c, sketch). The use to which this building was put is unknown, and although it is not like the mansion house and stable shown upon the plan of the estate made in <dateStruct value="1732-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1732">1732</year></dateStruct>, still it is probable that it was in existence at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>It is quite likely that the <persName n="Royall,senior-Colonel,,,," id="n0334.0016.00149.01189" reg="nearbymention:Royall,Isaac,,,"><roleName n="senior-Colonel">senior Colonel</roleName> <surname>Royall</surname></persName> built some portion of the present building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>Bringing with him from the <placeName reg="Antigua" key="tgn,7004640">island of Antigua</placeName> <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> slaves, he must have required more accommodations for <figure id="fig.149"> 
<head>Slave quarters.</head></figure> them than this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> building would furnish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>The next step in the evolution of the slave quarters was the brick portion of the present building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>This building is <num value="2">two</num> stories in height and contains <num value="2">two</num> rooms, with a deep cellar under the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>The lower room, with its ample fireplace and brick oven, was the kitchen, where tradition says the food of the slaves was prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>The upper room was probably used as a sleeping-apartment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>It will be seen that in the construction of this addition the brickwork on the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> sides was butted <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> against the brick end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> building, thus making the old brick wall a part of the new addition (a, sketch). The brickwork in the south side and west end of this structure has in every <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> course a course of headers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>This is the same construction as appears in the new part of the mansion house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>The bond in the north brick wall is the old Flemish bond, every course alternate headers and stretchers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> step in the evolution of this building is the wooden portion of the present building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>There is little of interest in this addition except that a small portion of the cellar has been partitioned off by a solid stone wall and lighted by <num value="2">two</num> small windows, <num value="1">one</num> on each side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>A doorway connects it with the cellar under the brick addition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>This cellar may possibly be the dungeon tradition speaks of as a place that once existed for the punishment of the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>The chimney of this addition (this may be the original chimney) is laid up against the chimney of the brick addition, and the <num value="2">two</num> united at the top so as to give the appearance of a single chimney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>On the west side of the brick portion of the building was at <num value="1">one</num> time a wooden addition <num value="2">two</num> stories in height, length unknown, the only visible proof of this addition being the mortar that still adheres to the brick wall on the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> sides, where the outside finish lapped over on the brick building, and the joints of which were plastered over to keep out the weather (see d, sketch). This is the same arrangement that exists in the present building, where the brick and wooden parts are joined together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>As has been before stated, the dates of the construction of these several additions are unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>I have endeavored to show what this building is and has been, and will leave our readers to draw their own conclusions.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>Behind the house, as we view it, was an enclosed garden of half an acre or more, with walks, fruit-trees, and a summer house at the farther extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>No doubt this was the favorite resort of the family and their guests.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>This summer house, a veritable curiosity in its way, is placed upon an artificial mound with <num value="2">two</num> terraces, and is reached by broad flights of red sandstone steps.</p>
