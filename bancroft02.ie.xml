<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The restoration of the legitimate dynasty was attended by a corresponding change in colonial policy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The revolution, which was now come to its end, had been in its origin a democratic revolution, and had apparently succeeded in none of its ultimate purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>In the gradual progress of civilization, the power of the feudal aristocracy had been broken by the increased authority of the monarch; and the people, now beginning to claim the lead in the progress of humanity, prepared to contend for equality against privilege, as well as for freedom against prerogative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The contest failed for a season, because too much was at once attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Immediate emancipation from the decaying institutions of the past was impossible; hereditary inequalities were themselves endeared to the nation, from a love for the beneficent institutions with which close union had identified them; the mass of the people was still buried in the inactivity of listless ignorance; even for the strongest minds, public experience had not yet generated the principles by which <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> a reconstruction of the government on a popular basis<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Chap <num value="11">XI</num>.}</note> could have been safely undertaken; and thus the democratic revolution in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 11" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was a failure, alike from the events and passions of the fierce struggle which rendered moderation impossible, and from the misfortune of the age, which had not as yet acquired the political knowledge that time alone could gather for the use of later generations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The councils of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> were divided by hesitancy, rivalries, and the want of plan; while the popular leaders were full of energy and union, and were animated by what seemed a distinct purpose, the desire of limiting the royal authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The movement in the public mind, though it derived its vigor as well as its origin from the rising influence of the <name>Puritans</name>, was not directed towards vindicating power for the people, but only aimed at raising an impassable barrier against the encroachments of royalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The object met with favor from a majority of the peerage, and from royalists among the commons; and the past arbitrary measures of the court found opponents in <placeName key="possibilities=12" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Hyde</placeName>, the inflexible tory and faithful counsellor of the <name>Stuarts</name>; in the more scrupulous <persName><foreName>Falkland</foreName></persName>, who hated falsehood and intrigue, and whose imagination inclined him to the popular side, till he began to dread innovations from its leaders more than from the ambition of the king; and even in Capel, afterwards <num value="1">one</num> of the bravest of the <name>Cavaliers</name>, and a martyr on the scaffold for his obstinate fidelity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The highest authority in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 11" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> began to belong to the majority in parliament; no <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">republican party</orgName> as yet existed; the <orgName type="division" n="division 1">first division</orgName> ensued between the ultra royalists and the vast undivided party of the friends of constitutional monarchy; and though the house was in a great measure filled with members of the aristocracy, the moderate royalists were united with the friends of the people; and, on the choice of speaker, an immense majority appeared in favor of the constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Parliament, in its turn, subverted the constitution, by establishing its own paramount authority, and making itself virtually irresponsible to its constituents; it was evident a parliamentary despotism would ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The <name>English</name> government was substantially changed, in a manner injurious to the power of the executive, and still more dangerous to the freedom of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The king, in so far as he opposed the measure, was the friend of popular liberty; the passage of the act placed the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 11" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, not less than the king, at the mercy of the parliament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The methods of tyranny are always essentially the same; the freedom of the press was subjected to parliamentary censors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The usurpation foreboded the subversion of the throne, and the subjection of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The liberators of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 11" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were become its tyrants; the rights of the nation had been asserted only to be sequestered for their use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The contest was between a permanent parliament and an arbitrary king.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The people had no mode of intervention except by serving in the armies; they could not come forward as mediators or as masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The parliament was become a body, of which the duration depended on its own will; unchecked by a supreme executive, or by an independent coordinate branch of legislation; and, therefore, of necessity, a multitudinous despot, unbalanced and irresponsible; levying taxes, enlisting soldiers, commanding the navy and the army, enacting laws, and changing at its will the forms of the <rs>English</rs> constitution.
