<head>Preface.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>in the initial number of the rebellion record, it was stated that the work proposed to furnish, <quote>in a digested and systematic shape, a comprehensive history of this struggle; sifting fact from fiction and rumor; presenting the poetical and picturesque aspects, the notable and characteristic incidents, separated from the graver and more important documents.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>It was observed that we did not aim either to <quote>supersede or to keep pace with the newspapers, but to subject them, both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, to the crucible of <hi rend="italics">time;</hi> following them at such distance as may be required to verify and classify all that is best worth preserving out of the immense mass of leaders, speeches, letters, and reports, which crowd the daily press;</quote> <quote>everys important document and extended narrative being given in consecutive order, and numbered, with references from the <name>Diary</name>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The editor, aiming at entire impartiality, has collected, from <hi rend="italics">every quarter</hi>, whatever appeared to be of general interest, in any way connected with the great topics of the day, or likely to elucidate, in the slightest degree, the questions at issue, or the spirit and temper of the people, whether loyal or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Thus it will be found that a very considerable portion of the volume is occupied with <quote>secession documents,</quote> or articles from the <quote>secession</quote> press, reprinted <hi rend="italics">verbatim</hi>, without alteration, or comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Every individual who has spoken or written with effect on either side, or <quote>on the fence,</quote> has been placed <quote>on record,</quote> and his utterances are here electrotyped for the benefit of future generations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The volume is paged in <num value="3">three</num> divisions, viz., <persName n="Diary,,I.,,," id="n0082.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Diary,I.,,,"><foreName>I.</foreName> <surname>Diary</surname></persName> of Events; <num value="2">II</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Documents and Narratives; <num value="3">III</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Poetry, Rumors, Incidents, etc. A full Index and a Table of Contents are added; and the whole is preceded by the able and comprehensive address by <persName n="Everett,Mister,Edward,,," id="n0082.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Everett,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName>, discussing with even more than <pb n="iv"/>his accustomed vigor, eloquence, and force, the principles and conclusions involved in this great contest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The work will be continued during the rebellion, and will embrace its entire history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The concluding numbers will contain a comprehensive historical sketch, in which the whole story will be presented in a clear and connected narrative form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>To do this properly at present, in the midst of the turmoil, and the conflicting reports and opinions of the day, is manifestly impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>When the smoke of the battle shall be fairly cleared away; when the results shall be correctly ascertained; and when the nation is restored, as all <hi rend="italics">faith</hi>ful citizens believe it will be speedily, to a peaceful and prosperous Union, it will be time enough to trace accurately and consecutively the outline of the most extraordinary and unjustifiable conspiracy and rebellion which the world has ever witnessed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In closing this volume, the <rs>Editor</rs> acknowledges his obligations to the numerous individuals from whom he has received valuable assistance; and especially to the officers of the <orgName n="U.

<head>Prosperous State of the country last year.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>A twelvemonth ago, nay, <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> ago, our country was regarded and spoken of by the rest of the civilized world, as among the most prosperous in the family of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It was classed with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, as <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> leading powers of the age.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were particularly referred to, on all occasions and in all countries, as an illustration of the mighty influence of free governments in promoting the prosperity of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, notwithstanding some diplomatic collisions on boundary questions and occasional hostile reminiscences of the past, there has hardly been a debate for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> in parliament on any topic, in reference to which this country in the <pb id="p.6" n="6"/>nature of things afforded matter of comparison, in which it was not referred to as furnishing instructive examples of prosperous enterprise and hopeful progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>At home, the country grew as by enchantment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Its vast geographical extent, augmented by magnificent accessions of conterminous territory peacefully made; its population far more rapidly increasing than that of any other country, and swelled by an emigration from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> such as the world has never before seen; the mutually beneficial intercourse between its different sections and climates, each supplying what the other wants; the rapidity with which the arts of civilization have been extended over a before unsettled wilderness, and, together with this material prosperity, the advance of the country in education, literature, science, and refinement, formed a spectacle, of which the history of mankind furnished no other example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>That such was the state of the country <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago was matter of general recognition and acknowledgment at home and abroad.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.intro.2" type="section" n="c.intro.2"> 
<head>The Presidential election and its results</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>There was, however, <num value="1">one</num> sad deduction to be made, not from the truth of this description, not from the fidelity of this picture for that is incontestable, but from the content, happiness, and mutual good will which ought to have existed on the part of a People, favored by such an accumulation of Providential blessings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I allude, of course, to the great sectional controversies which have so long agitated the country, and arrayed the people in bitter geographical antagonism of political organization and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Fierce party contentions had always existed in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as they ever have and unquestionably ever will exist under all free elective governments; and these contentions had, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, tended somewhat to a sectional character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They had not, however, till quite lately, assumed that character so exclusively, that the minority in any <num value="1">one</num> part of the country had not had a respectable electoral representation in every other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Till last <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, there has never been a Southern Presidential Candidate, who did not receive electoral votes at the <rs>North</rs>, nor a Northern Candidate who did not receive electoral votes at the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>At the late election and for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, this was not the case; and consequences the most extraordinary and deplorable have resulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The country, as we have seen, being in profound peace at home and abroad, and in a state of unexampled prosperity &mdash; Agriculture, Commerce, Navigation, Manufactures, <name>East</name>, <name>West</name>, <name>North</name>, and <name>South</name> recovered or rapidly recovering from the crisis of <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>--powerful and respected abroad, and thriving beyond example at home, entered in the usual manner upon the electioneering campaign, for the choice of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I say in the usual manner, though it is true that parties were more than usually broken up and subdivided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The normal division was into <num value="2">two</num> great parties, but there had on several former occasions been <num value="3">three</num>; in <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct> there were <num value="4">four</num>, and there were <num value="4">four</num> last <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The South equally with the <rs>West</rs> and the <rs>North</rs> entered into the canvass; conventions were held, nominations made, mass meetings assembled; the platform, the press enlisted with unwonted vigor; the election in all its stages, conducted in legal and constitutional form, without violence and without surprise, and the result obtained by a decided majority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>No sooner, however, was this result ascertained, than it appeared on the part <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and her example was rapidly followed by others, that it had by no means been the intention of those States to abide by the result of the election, except on the <num value="1">one</num> condition, of the choice of their candidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The reference of the great sectional controversy to the peaceful arbitrament of the ballot box, the great safety valve of republican institutions, though made with every appearance of good faith, on the part of our brethren at the <rs>South</rs>, meant but this: if we succeed in this election, as we have in <num value="15">fifteen</num> that have preceded it, well and good; we will consent to govern the country for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> more, as we have already governed it for <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure>; but we have no intention of acquiescing in any other result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We do not mean to abide by the election, although we participate in it, unless our candidate is chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>If he fails we intend to prostrate the <rs>Government</rs> and break up the <rs>Union</rs>; peaceably, if the <name>States</name> composing the majority are willing that it should be broken up peaceably; otherwise, at the point of the sword.</p></div2>

<head><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> Secedes from the <rs>Union</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The election took place on the <dateStruct value="-11-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, and in pursuance of the extraordinary programme just described, the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, acting by a Convention chosen for the purpose, assembled on the <dateStruct value="-12-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, and on the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="2">20th</day></dateStruct>, passed unanimously what was styled <quote>an ordinance to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs> between the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> and other States united with her, under the compact entitled the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution, of the United States</rs> of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It is not my purpose on this occasion to make a documentary speech, but as this so-called <quote>Ordinance</quote> is very short, and affords matter for deep reflection, I beg leave to recite it in full: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/></p> 
<p> We, the <name>People</name> of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, in Convention assembled, do declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, that the ordinance adopted by us in Convention on the <dateStruct value="-05-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> day of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="1788--">in the year of our Lord <year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct>, whereby the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was ratified, and also all acts and parts of acts of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">general assembly</orgName> of this State, ratifying the amendments of the said Constitution, are hereby repealed, and that the <rs>Union</rs> now subsisting between <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and other States, under the name of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>, is dissolved.</p></quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This remarkable document is called an <quote>Ordinance,</quote> and no doubt some special virtue is supposed to reside in the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But names are nothing except as they truly represent things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>An ordinance, if it is any thing clothed with binding force, is a Law, and nothing but a Law, and as such this ordinance, being in direct violation of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, is a mere nullity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The Constitution contains the following express provision: <quote>This Constitution and the <name>Laws</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> made in pursuance thereof, and the treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Such being the express provision of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, which the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> adopted in <dateStruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct>, just as much as they ever adopted either of their State Constitutions, is it not trifling with serious things to claim that, by the simple expedient of passing a law under the name of an ordinance, this; provision and <pb id="p.8" n="8"/>every other provision of it may be nullified, and every magistrate and officer in <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>, whether of the <rs>State</rs> or Union, absolved from the oath which they have taken to support it?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But this is not all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It was intended, of course, by calling the act of ratification an ordinance to infer a right of repealing it by another ordinance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It is important, therefore, to observe that the act of ratification is not, and was not at the time called, an ordinance, and contains nothing which by possibility can be repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It is in the following terms:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><quote>The Convention [of the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>], having maturely considered the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or form of government, reported to Congress by the <orgName n="Delegates Convention" type="convention">convention of delegates</orgName> from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>, and submitted to them, by a resolution of the <name>Legislature</name> of this State passed the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> and <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> days of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of the said <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and their posterity, do, in the name and in behalf of the people of this State, hereby assent to and ratify the same.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Here it is evident that there is nothing in the instrument which, in the nature of things, can be repealed; it is an authorized solemn assertion of the <name>People</name> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, that they assent to, and ratify a form of government, which is declared in terms to be paramount to all State laws and constitutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>This is a great historical fact, the most important that can ever occur in the history of a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The fact that the <name>People</name> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="1788-05-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1788</year>,</dateStruct> assented to and ratified the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, in order, among other objects, to secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and <quote>their posterity,</quote> can no more be repealed in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, than any other historical fact that occurred in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> in that year and on that day. It would be just as rational, at the present day, to attempt by ordinance to repeal any other event, as that the sun rose or that the tide ebbed and flowed on that day, as to repeal by ordinance the assent of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Again: it is well known that various amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> were desired and proposed in different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the amendments proposed by <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> was as follows :--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/><quote> Whereas it is essential to the preservation of the rights reserved to the several States and the freedom of the <name>People</name> under the operation of the <rs>General Government</rs>, that the right of prescribing the manner, times, and places of holding the elections of the <orgName n="Federal Legislature" type="legislature">Federal Legislature</orgName> should be <hi rend="italics">forever inseparably</hi> annexed to the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>; this Convention doth declare that the same ought to remain to <hi rend="italics">all posterity</hi>, a perpetual and fundamental right in the <hi rend="italics">local</hi>, exclusive of the interference of the <hi rend="italics">general</hi> Government, except in cases where the <name>Legislature</name> of the <name>States</name> shall refuse or neglect to perform or fulfil the same, according to the tenor of the said Constitution.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Here you perceive that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> herself in <dateStruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct> desired a provision to be made and annexed inseparably to her sovereignty, that she should forever have the power of prescribing the time, place, and manner of holding the elections of <pb id="p.9" n="9"/>members of Congress;--but even in making this express reservation, to operate for all posterity, she was willing to provide that, if the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> refuse or neglect to perform the duty, (which is precisely the case of the <rs>Seceding States</rs> at the present day,) then the <rs>General Government</rs> was, by this <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> amendment, expressly authorized to do it. <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct>, by a sort of prophetic foresight, looked forward to the possibility that the <name>States</name> might <quote>refuse or neglect</quote> to cooperate in carrying on the <rs>Government</rs>, and admitted, in that case, that the <rs>General Government</rs> must go on, in spite of their delinquency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I have dwelt on these points at some length, to show how futile is the attempt, by giving the name of <quote>ordinance</quote> to the act, by which <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> adopted the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and entered the <rs>Union</rs>, to gain a power to leave it by a subsequent ordinance of repeal.<note anchored="yes">

<head>Neither a granted nor a reserved right.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>This assumed right of Secession rests upon the doctrine that the <rs>Union</rs> is a compact between Independent States, from which any <num value="1">one</num> of them may withdraw at pleasure in virtue of its sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>This imaginary right has been the subject of discussion for more than <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, having been originally suggested, though not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> much dwelt upon, in connection with the kindred claim of a right, on the part of an individual State, to <quote>nullify</quote> an Act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It would, of course, be impossible within the limits of the hour to review these elaborate discussions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I will only remark, on this occasion, that none of the premises from which this remarkable conclusion is drawn, are recognized in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and that the right of Secession, though claimed to be a <quote>reserved</quote> right, is not <hi rend="italics">expressly</hi> reserved in it. That instrument does not purport to be a <quote>compact,</quote> but a Constitution of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It appears, in its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sentence, not to have been entered into by the <name>States</name>, but to have been ordained and established by the <name>People</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, for <quote>themselves and their posterity.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The States are not named in it; nearly all the characteristic powers of sovereignty are expressly granted to the <pb id="p.10" n="10"/>General Government and expressly prohibited to the <name>States</name>, and so far from reserving a right of secession to the latter, on any ground or under any pretence, it ordains and establishes in terms the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> as the <rs>Supreme Law</rs> of the land, any thing in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or Laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>It would seem that this is as clear and positive as language can make it. But it is argued, that, though the right of secession is not reserved in terms, it must be considered as implied in the general reservation to the <name>States</name> and to the <name>People</name> of all the powers not granted to Congress nor prohibited to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>This extraordinary assumption, more distinctly stated, is that, in direct defiance of the express grant to Congress and the express prohibition to the <name>States</name> of nearly all the powers of an independent government, there is, <hi rend="italics">by implication</hi>, a right reserved to the <name>States</name> to assume and exercise all these powers thus vested in the <rs>Union</rs> and prohibited to themselves, simply in virtue of going through the ceremony of passing a law called an Ordinance of Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>A general reservation to the <name>States</name> of powers not prohibited to them, nor granted to Congress is an implied reservation to the <name>States</name> of a right to exercise these very powers thus expressly delegated to Congress and thus expressly prohibited to the <name>States</name>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The Constitution directs that the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> shall have power to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy, and that the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by and with the advice and consent of the <name>Senate</name>, shall make treaties with foreign powers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>These express grants of power to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are followed by prohibitions as express to the several States:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/><quote> No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation, grant letters of marque or reprisal: no State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>These and numerous other express grants of power to the <rs>General Government</rs>, and express prohibitions to the <name>States</name>, are further enforced by the comprehensive provision, already recited, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> and Laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are paramount to the laws and Constitution of the separate States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>And this Constitution, with these express grants and express prohibitions, and with this express subordination of the <name>States</name> to the <rs>General Government</rs>, has been adopted by the <name>People</name> of all the <name>States</name>; and all their judges and other officers, and all their citizens holding office under the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> or the individual States, are solemnly sworn to support it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>In the face of all this, in defiance of all this, in violation of all this, in contempt of all this, the seceding States claim the right to exercise every power expressly delegated to Congress and expressly prohibited to the <name>States</name> by that Constitution, which every <num value="1">one</num> of their prominent men, civil and military, is under oath to support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>They have entered into a confederation, raised an army, attempted to provide a navy, issued letters of marque and reprisal, waged war, and that war,--Merciful Heaven forgive them,--not with a foreign enemy, not with the wild tribes which still desolate the unprotected frontier; (they, it is said, are swelling, armed with tomahawk and scalping-knife, the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName>;) but with their own <pb id="p.11" n="11"/>countrymen, and the mildest and most beneficent government on the face of the earth!</p></div2>

<head>Is the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> oppressive and tyrannical?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>An oppressive and tyrannical government!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Let us examine this pretence for a few moments, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the general, and then ill the detail of its alleged tyrannies and abuses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>This oppressive and tyrannical Government is the successful solution of a problem, which had tasked the sagacity of mankind from the dawn of civilization; viz.: to find a form of polity, by which institutions purely popular could be extended over a vast empire, free alike from despotic centralization and undue preponderance of the local powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It was necessarily a complex system; a Union at once federal and national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It leaves to the separate States the control of all matters of purely local administration, and confides to the central power the management of Foreign affairs and of all other concerns in which the <rs>United</rs> family have a joint interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>All the organized and delegated powers depend directly or very nearly <pb id="p.23" n="23"/>so on popular choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>This Government was not imposed upon the <name>People</name> by a foreign conqueror; it is not an inheritance descending from barbarous ages, laden with traditionary abuses, which create a painful ever-recurring necessity of reform; it is not the conceit of heated enthusiasts in the spasms of a revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It is the recent and voluntary frame-work of an enlightened age, compacted by wise and good men, with deliberation and care, working upon materials prepared by long Colonial discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>In framing it, they sought to combine the merits and to avoid the defects of former systems of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The greatest possible liberty of the citizen is the basis; just representation the ruling principle, reconciling with rare ingenuity the federal equality of the <name>States</name>, with the proportionate influence of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Its legislative and executive magistrates are freely chosen at short periods; its judiciary alone holding office by a more permanent, but still sufficiently responsible, tenure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>No money flows into or out of the <name>Treasury</name> but under the direct sanction of the representatives of the <name>People</name>, on whom also all the great functions of Government for peace and war, within the limits already indicated, are devolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>No hereditary titles or privileges, no distinction of ranks, no established church, no courts of <orgName n="High Commission" type="commission">high commission</orgName>, no censorship of the press, are known to the system; not a drop of blood has ever flowed under its authority for a political offence; but this tyrannical and oppressive Government has certainly exhibited a more perfect development of equal republican principles, than has ever before existed on any considerable scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Under its benign influence, the country, every part of the country, has prospered beyond all former example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Its population has increased; its commerce, agriculture, and manufactures have flourished; manners, arts, education, letters, all that dignifies and ennobles man, have in a shorter period attained a higher point of cultivation than has ever before been witnessed in a newly settled region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The consequence has been consideration and influence abroad and marvellous well-being at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The world has looked with admiration upon the <rs>Country</rs>'s progress; we have ourselves contemplated it, perhaps, with undue self-complacency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Armies without conscription; navies without impressment, and neither army nor navy swelled to an oppressive size; an over-flowing treasury without direct taxation or oppressive taxation of any kind; churches without number and with no denominational preferences on the part of the <rs>State</rs>; schools and colleges accessible to all the people; a free and a cheap press;--all the great institutions of social life extending their benefits to the mass of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Such, no <num value="1">one</num> can deny, is the <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> of this oppressive and tyrannical government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>But perhaps this Government, however wisely planned, however beneficial even in its operation, may have been rendered distasteful, or may have become oppressive in <num value="1">one</num> part of the country and to <num value="1">one</num> portion of the people, in consequence of the control of affairs having been monopolized or unequally shared by another portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>In a Confederacy, the people of <num value="1">one</num> section are not well pleased to be even mildly governed by an exclusive domination of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>In point of fact this is the allegation, the persistent allegation of the <rs>South</rs>, that from the foundation of the <rs>Government</rs> it has been wielded by the people of the <rs>North</rs> for their special, often exclusive, benefit, and to the injury and oppression of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Let us see. Out of <measure n="72years" type="date">seventy-two years</measure> since the organization of the <rs>Government</rs>, the <rs>Executive</rs> chair has, for <measure n="64years" type="date">sixty-four years</measure>, been filled nearly all the time by Southern <pb id="p.24" n="24"/><rs type="role2">Presidents</rs>; and when that was not the case, by <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> possessing the confidence of the <name>Sputh</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>For a still longer period, the controlling influences of the <rs>Legislative</rs> and Judicial departments of the <rs>Government</rs> have centred in the same quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Of all the offices in the gift of the central power in every department, far more than her proportionate share has always been enjoyed by the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>She is at this moment revolting against a Government, not only admitted to be the mildest and most beneficent ever organized this side Utopia, but <num value="1">one</num> of which she has herself from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, almost monopolized the administration.</p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>But are there no wrongs, abuses, and oppressions, alleged to have been suffered by the <rs>South</rs>, which have rendered her longer submission to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> intolerable, and which are pleaded as the motive and justification of the revolt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Of course there are, but with such variation and uncertainty of statement as to render their examination difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The document does not state that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> herself ever lost a slave in consequence of these laws, it is not probable she ever did, and yet she makes the existence of these laws, which are wholly inoperative as far as she is concerned, and which probably never caused to the entire <rs>South</rs> the loss of a dozen fugitives, the ground for breaking up the <rs>Union</rs> and plunging the country into a civil war. But I shall presently revert to this topic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Other statements in other quarters enlarge the list of grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>In the month of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, after the result of the presidential election was ascertained, a very interesting discussion of the subject of secession took place at <placeName key="tgn,2023617" n="1.000 65" reg="milledgeville, baldwin, georgia">Milledgeville</placeName>, before the members of the <orgName n="Georgia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Georgia</orgName> and the citizens generally, between <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen of great ability and eminence, since elected, the <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, the other <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> of the new Confederacy; the former urging the necessity and duty of immediate secession;--the latter opposing it.

<head>Representation of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the slaves.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>I trust I have shown the flagrant injustice of this whole attempt to fasten upon the <rs>North</rs> the charge of wielding the powers of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to the prejudice of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>But there is <num value="1">one</num> great fact connected with this subject, seldom prominently brought forward, which ought forever to close the lips of the <rs>South</rs>, in this warfare of sectional reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>Under the old Confederation, the <rs>Congress</rs> consisted of but one <persName n="House,,,,," id="n0082.0002.00035.00476" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName>, and each State, large and small, had but a single vote, and consequently an equal share in the <rs>Government</rs>, if Government it could be called, of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>This manifest injustice was barely tolerable in a state of war, when the imminence of the public danger tended to produce unanimity of feeling and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>When the country was relieved from the pressure of the war, and discordant interests more and more disclosed themselves, the equality of the <name>States</name> became a positive element of discontent, and contributed its full share to the downfall of that short-lived and ill.compacted frame of Government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Accordingly, when the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was formed, the great object and the main difficulty was to reconcile the equality of the <name>States</name>, (which gave to <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> and <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName> equal weight with <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>,) with a proportionate representation of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Each of these principles was of vital importance; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> being demanded by the small States, as due to their equal independence, and the last being demanded by the large States, in virtue of the fact that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was the work and the <rs>Government</rs> of the people, and in conformity with the great law in which the <name>Revolution</name> had its origin, that representation and taxation should go hand in hand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The problem was solved, in the <rs>Federal Convention</rs>, by a system of extremely refined arrangements, of which the chief was that there should be two Houses of Congress, that each State should have an equal representation in the <name>Senate</name>, (voting, however, not by States, but <hi rend="italics">per capita</hi>,) and a number of representatives in the <rs type="place">House</rs> in proportion to its population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>But here a formidable difficulty presented itself, growing out of the anomalous character of the population of the slave-holding States, consisting as it did of a dominant and a subject class, the latter excluded by local law from the enjoyment of all political rights, and regarded simply as property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>In this state of things, was it just or equitable that the slaveholding States, in addition to the number of representatives to which their free population entitled them, should have a further share in the government of the country, on account of the slaves held as property by a small portion of the ruling class?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>While property of every kind in the non-slaveholding States was unrepresented, <pb id="p.36" n="36"/>was it just that this species of property, forming a large proportion of the entire property of the <rs>South</rs>, should be allowed to swell the representation of the slave-holding States?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>This serious difficulty was finally disposed of, in a manner mutually satisfactory, by providing that Representatives and direct Taxes should be apportioned among the <name>States</name> on the same basis of population, ascertained by adding to the whole number of free persons <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>It was expected at this time that the <rs>Federal Treasury</rs> would be mainly supplied by direct taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>While, therefore, the rule adopted gave to the <rs>South</rs> a number of representatives out of proportion to the number of her citizens, she would be restrained from exercising this power to the prejudice of the <rs>North</rs>, by the fact that any increase of the public burdens would fall in the same increased proportion on herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>For the additional weight which the <rs>South</rs> gained in the presidential election, by this adjustment, the <rs>North</rs> received no compensation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>But now mark the practical operation of the compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>Direct taxation, instead of being the chief resource of the <name>Treasury</name>, has been resorted to but <num value="4">four</num> times since the foundation of the <rs>Government</rs>, and then for small amounts; in <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct> <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of dollars, in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct> <num value="3000000">three millions</num>, in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct> <num value="6000000">six millions</num>, in <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct> <num value="3000000">three millions</num> again, in all <num value="14000000">fourteen millions</num>, the sum total raised by direct taxation in <measure n="72years" type="date">seventy-two years</measure>, less than an average of <measure n="200000dollars" type="currency">200,000 dollars</measure> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>What number of representatives, beyond the proportion of their free population, the <rs>South</rs> has elected in former Congresses I have not computed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>In the last Congress she was represented by <num value="20">twenty</num> members, in behalf of her slaves, being nearly <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> part of the entire <orgName n="House" type="government">House</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>As the increasing ratio of the <num value="2">two</num> classes of population has not greatly varied, it is probable that the <rs>South</rs>, in virtue of her slaves, has always enjoyed about the same proportionate representation in the <rs type="place">House</rs>, in excess of that accruing from her free population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>As it has rarely happened in our political divisions that important measures have been carried by large majorities, this excess has been quite sufficient to assure the <rs>South</rs> a majority on all sectional questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>It enabled her to elect her candidate for the <name>Presidency</name> in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, and thus effect the great political revolution of that year, and is sufficient of itself to account for that approach to a monopoly of the <rs>Government</rs> which she has ever enjoyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Now, though the consideration for which the <rs>North</rs> agreed to this arrangement, may be said to have wholly failed, it has nevertheless been quietly acquiesced in. I do not mean that in times of high party excitement it has never been alluded to as a hardship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>The <orgName n="Hartford Convention" type="convention">Hartford Convention</orgName> spoke of it as a grievance which ought to be remedied; but even since our political controversies have turned almost wholly on the subject of slavery, I am not aware that this entire failure of the equivalent, for which the <rs>North</rs> gave up to the <rs>South</rs> what has secured to her, in fact, the almost exclusive control of the <rs>Government</rs> of the country, has been a frequent or a prominent subject of complaint.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>So much for the pursuit by the <rs>North</rs> of measures hostile to the interests of the <rs>South</rs>;--so much for the grievances urged by the <rs>South</rs> as her justification for bringing upon the country the crimes and sufferings of civil war, and aiming at the prostration of a Government admitted by herself to be the most perfect the world has seen, and under which all her own interests have been eminently protected and <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>favored; for to complete the demonstration of the unreasonableness of her complaints, it is necessary only to add, that, by the admission of her leading public men, there never was a time when her <quote>peculiar institution</quote> was so stable and prosperous as at the present moment.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>my dear Sir: Since I came home, I have looked carefully at the ratification of the <rs>Constitution</rs> by <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>The formal instrument, sent to Congress, seems to be much more in the nature of a Deed or <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0082.0003.00043.00494" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, than of an <hi rend="italics">Ordinance</hi>. An ordinance would seem to be an instrument adopted by a public body, for the regulation of a subject that in its nature remains under the regulation of that body;--to operate until otherwise ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>A Deed, or <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0082.0003.00043.00495" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, on the other hand, operates to pass some things; and unless there be a reservation of some control over the subject-matter by the <name>Grantor</name>, his cession is necessarily irrevocable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>I can perceive no reason why these distinctions are not applicable to the cession of political powers by a People, or their duly authorized representatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>The question submitted to the <name>People</name> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, by the <rs>Congress</rs>, was, Whether they would cede the powers of government embraced in an instrument sent to them, and called the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>In other words, they were asked to make a Grant of those Powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>When, therefore, the duly authorized Delegates of the <name>People</name> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> executed an instrument under seal, declaring that they, <quote>in the name and behalf</quote> of that people, <quote>assent to and ratify the said Constitution,</quote> I can perceive no propriety in calling this Deed an <hi rend="italics">Ordinance</hi>. If they had adopted an instrument entitled, <quote>An Act [or Ordinance] for the government of the <name>People</name> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>,</quote> and had gone on, in the body of the instrument, to declare that the <name>Powers</name> embraced in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> should be exercised by the agents therein provided, until otherwise ordered, there would have been something left for a repeal to operate upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>But nothing like this was done, and everybody knows that such a ratification could not have been accepted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>There are those, as you are well aware, who pretend that the most absolute and unrestricted terms of cession, which would carry any other subject entirely out of tho grantor, do not so operate when the subject of the grant is political sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>But a political school which maintains that a deed is to be construed in <num value="1">one</num> way when it purports to convey <num value="1">one</num> description of right, such as political sovereignty, and in another <pb id="p.44" n="44"/>way when it purports to convey a right of another kind, such as property, would hold a very weak brief in any tribunal of jurisprudence, if the question could be brought to that arbitrament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>The American people have been very much accustomed to treat political grants, made by the sovereign power without reservation, as irrevocable conveyances and executed contracts; and although they hold to the right of revolution, they have not yet found out how a deed, absolute on its face, is to be treated in point of law, as a repealable instrument, because it deals with political rights and duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>If any court in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> were now to have the question come before it, whether the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are still binding upon their citizens, I think they would have to put their denial upon the naked doctrine of <hi rend="italics">revolution;</hi> and that they could not hold that, as matter of law and regular political action, their ratification deed of <dateStruct value="1788-05-23"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="23">23d</day>, <year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct>, is <quote>repealed</quote> by their late ordinance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The letter I read in the speech which I made in <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName>, should be conclusive evidence that, at its date, <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0082.0003.00044.00501" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> denied the right of secession, as a constitutional right, either express or implied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>But, in addition to this, I had frequent opportunities of knowing that this was his opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>It was my good fortune to be a member of the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>, whilst he was <num value="1">one</num> of its greatest ornaments, for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, from <dateStruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct>, until I became a member of <persName n="Taylor,General,,,," id="n0082.0003.00044.00502" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,Bayard,,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s administration, and during <num value="2">two</num> sessions (I think <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>) I lived in the same house with him. He did me the honor to give me much of his confidence, and frequently his nullification doctrine was the subject of conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Time and time again have I heard him, and with ever increased surprise at his wonderful acuteness, defend it on <placeName reg="Constitutional grounds">Constitutional grounds</placeName>, and distinguish it, <hi rend="italics">in that respect</hi>, from the doctrine of Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>This last he never, with me, placed on any other ground than that of revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>This, he said, was to destroy the <rs>Government</rs>; and no Constitution, the work of sane men, ever provided <hi rend="italics">for its own destruction</hi>. The other was to preserve it, was, practically, but to amend it, and in a constitutional mode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>As you know, and he was ever told, I never took that view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>I could see no more constitutional warrant for this than for the other, which, I repeat, he ever in all our interviews repudiated, as wholly indefensible as a constitutional remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>His mind, with all its wonderful power, was so ingenious that it often led him into error, and at times to such an extent as to be guilty of the most palpable inconsistencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>His views of the tariff and internal improvement powers of the <rs>Government</rs>, are instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opinions upon both were decided, and almost ultra.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>His earliest reputation was won as their advocate, and yet <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> before his death he denounced both, with constant zeal and with rare power, and, whilst doing so, boldly asserted his uniform consistency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>It is no marvel, therefore, with those who have observed his career and studied his character, to hear it stated now that he was the advocate of constitutional secession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>It may be so, and perhaps is so; but this in no way supports the doctrine, as far as it is rested on his authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> views were well considered and formed, without the influence of extraneous circumstances, of which he seemed to me to be often the victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/><pb id="p.45" n="45"/>Pure in private life and in motives, ever, as I believe and have always believed, patriotic, he was induced, seemingly without knowing it, in his later life, to surrender to section what was intended for the whole, his great powers of analysis and his extraordinary talent for public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>If such a heresy, therefore, as constitutional secession could rest on any individual name, if any mere human authority could support such an absurd and destructive folly, it cannot be said to rest on that of <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0082.0003.00045.00503" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>The inevitable effect in the <rs>South</rs> was that she believed slavery to be an evil &mdash; weakness &mdash; disgraceful &mdash; nay, a sin. She shrunk from the discussion of it. She cowered under every threat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>But a few bold spirits took the question up &mdash; they compelled the <rs>South</rs> to investigate it anew and thoroughly, and what is the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Why, it would be difficult to find now a Southern man who feels the system to be the lightest burden on his conscience; who does not, in fact, regard it as an equal advantage to the master and the slave, elevating both, as wealth, strength, and power, and as <num value="1">one</num> of the main pillars and controlling influences of modern civilization, and who is not now prepared to maintain it at every hazard.
