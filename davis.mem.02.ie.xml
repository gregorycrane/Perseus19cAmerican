<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The inauguration of the permanent government, amid the struggles of war, was welcomed by our people as a sign of the independence for which all their sacrifices had been made, and the increased efforts of the enemy for our subjugation were met by corresponding determination on our part to maintain the rights our fathers left us at whatever cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>We now enter upon those terrible scenes of wrong and blood in which the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, driven to desperation by our successful resistance, broke through every restraint of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, of national law, of justice, and of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>But before commencing this fearful <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> narration, let us sum up the hostile acts and usurpations committed during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Our people had been declared to be combinations of insurrectionists, and more than <num value="150000">one hundred fifty thousand</num> men had been called to arms to invade our territory; our ports were blockaded for the destruction of our regular commerce, and we had been threatened with denunciation as pirates if we molested a vessel of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and some of our citizens had been confined in cells to await the punishment of piracy; <num value="1">one</num> of our states was rent asunder and a new state constructed out of the fragment; every proposition for a peaceful solution of pending issues had been spurned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>An indiscriminate warfare had been waged upon our peaceful citizens, their dwellings burned and their crops destroyed; a law had been passed imposing a penalty of forfeiture on the owner of any faithful slave who gave military or naval service to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and forbidding military commanders to interfere for the restoration of fugitives; the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> had refused to agree to an exchange of prisoners, and suffered those we had captured to languish in captivity; it had falsely represented us in every court of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, to defeat our efforts to obtain a recognition from foreign powers; it had seized a portion of the members of the legislature of <num value="1">one</num> state and confined them in a distant military prison, because they were thought merely to sympathize with us, though they had not committed an overt act; it had refused all the propositions of another state for a peaceful neutrality, invaded her and seized important positions, where not even a disturbance of the peace had occurred, and perpetrated the most despotic outrages on her people; it rejected the most conciliatory terms offered for the sake of peace by the governor of another state, claimed for itself an unrestricted right to move and station its troops whenever and wherever its officers might think it to be desirable, and persisted in its aggressions until the people were involved in conflicts and a provisional government became necessary for their protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Within the <rs>Northern</rs> states, which professed to be struggling to maintain the <rs>Union</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs>, its only bond, and the laws made in pursuance of it, were in peaceful, undisputed existence; yet even there the government ruled with the tyrant's hand, and the provisions for the freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the personal liberty of the citizen were daily violated, and these sacred rights of man suppressed by military force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>But some of these hostile actions require here a more specific consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>They were the antecedents of oppressive measures which the enemy strove to enforce upon us during the entire war. <pb id="p.3" n="3"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> session of the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">provisional Congress</orgName> commenced at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> on <dateStruct value="1861-07-20"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="20">20</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and ended on <dateStruct value="-08-31"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="31">31st</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>At the previous session a resolution had been passed authorizing the <rs>President</rs> to cause the several executive departments, with the archives thereof, to be removed to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> at such time as he might determine prior to <dateStruct value="-07-20"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In my message to the <rs>Congress</rs> of that date, the cause of removal was stated to be that the aggressive movements of the enemy required prompt, energetic action; that the accumulation of his forces on the <rs>Potomac</rs> sufficiently demonstrated that his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> efforts were to be directed against <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 16" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and from no point could necessary measures for her defense and protection be so effectively provided as from her own capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>My remarks to Congress at this session were confined to such important facts as had occurred during the recess, and to the matters connected with the public defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><q direct="unspecified">The odious features of the policy and purposes of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> stood revealed; the recent grant of <num value="0.5">a half</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> of men and <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars by their Congress, was a confession that their intention was a subjugation of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/></p> 
<p>The fact thus briefly presented in the message was established by the course pursued since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> advent to power of those who had come into possession of the sword and the purse of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Not only by the legislation cited was the intent to make war for the purpose of subjugating the <rs>Southern</rs> states revealed, but also, and yet more significantly, was the purpose manifested in the evasion and final rejection of every proposition of the <rs>Southern</rs> states for a peaceful solution of the issues arising from secession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Such extreme obstinacy was unnatural, unreasonable, and contrary to the general precedents of history, except those which resulted in civil war. This unfavorable indication was also observable in the original party of abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Its intolerance had a violence which neither truth nor justice nor religion could restrain, and it was transferred undiluted to their successors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The resistance to the demands of the states and persistence in aggressions upon them were the occasion of constant apprehensions and futile warnings of their suicidal tendency on the part of the statesmen of the period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>For <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> had patriotism and wisdom pointed to dissolution by this perverse uncharitableness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Had the <rs>North</rs> been contending for a principle only, there would have been a satisfactory settlement, not indeed by compromising the principle, but by adjusting the manner of its operation so that only good results should ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But when the contest is for supremacy on <num value="1">one</num> side and self-defense <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> on the other&mdash;when the aim of the aggressor is <q direct="unspecified">power, plunder, and extended rule</q>&mdash;there will be no concessions by him, no compromises, no adjustment of results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The alternative is subjugation by the sword, or peace by absolute submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The latter condition could not be accepted by us. The former was, therefore, to be resisted as best we might.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>An amazing insensibility seemed to possess a portion of the <rs>Northern</rs> people as to the crisis before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They would not realize that their purpose of supremacy would be so resolutely resisted; that, if persisted in, it must be carried to the extent of bloodshed in sectional war. With them the lust of dominion was stronger than the sense of justice or of the fraternity and the equal rights of the states, which the <rs>Union</rs> was formed to secure, and so they were blind to palpable results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Otherwise they must have seen, when the remnants of the old <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> joined hands with abolitionism, that it was like a league with the spirit of evil, in which the conditions of the bond were bestowal of power on <num value="1">one</num> side, and the commission of deeds meet for disunion on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The honest masses should have remembered that when scheming leaders abandon principle, and adopt the ideas of dreamers and fanatics, the ladder on which they would mount to power is <num value="1">one</num> on which they cannot return, and up which it would be a fatal delusion to follow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The reality of armed resistance on our part the <rs>North</rs> was slow to comprehend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The division of sentiment at the <rs>South</rs> on the question of the expediency of immediate secession, was mistaken for the existence of a submission party, whereas the division was confined to expediency, and wholly disappeared when our territory was invaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Then was revealed to them the necessity of defending their homes and liberties against the ruthless assault on both, and then extraordinary unanimity prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Then, as <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0129.0001.00004.00007" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,Alexander,,,:1"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n0129.0001.00004.00008" reg="mostcommon:Madison,James,,,:1"><surname>Madison</surname></persName> had stated, war against the states had effected the depreciated dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Adjustment by negotiation the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> had rejected, and had chosen to attempt our subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This course, adopted without provocation, was pursued with a ferocity that disregarded all the laws of civilized warfare, and must permanently remain a stain upon the escutcheon of a government once bright among the nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The vast provision made by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the material of war, the money appropriated, and the men enrolled, furnished a sufficient refutation to the pretense that they were engaged only in dispersing rioters, and suppressing unlawful combinations too strong for the usual course of judicial proceedings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Further, they virtually recognized the separate existence of the <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> by an interdictive embargo, and blockade of all commerce between them and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, not only by sea but by land; not only with those who bore arms, but with the entire population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They waged an indiscriminate war upon all: private houses in isolated retreats were bombarded and burned; grain crops in the field were consumed by the torch; when the torch was not applied, careful labor was bestowed to render complete the destruction of every article of use or ornament remaining in private dwellings after their female inhabitants had fled from the insults of brutal soldiers; a petty war was made on the sick, including women and children, by carefully devised measures to prevent them from obtaining the necessary medicines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Were these the appropriate means by which to execute the laws, and in suppressing rioters to secure tranquillity and preserve a voluntary union?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Was this a government resting on the consent of the governed?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At this session of the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> additional forces were provided to repel invasion, by authorizing the <rs>President</rs> to accept the services of any number of volunteers not exceeding <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> men. Authority was also given for suitable financial measures hereafter stated, and the levy of a tax. An act of sequestration was also adopted as a countervailing measure against the operations of the confiscation law enacted by the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> on <dateStruct value="1861-08-06"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="6">6</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This act of the <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States Congress</orgName>, with its complement passed in the ensuing year, will be considered further on in these pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most indicative of the sections, however, provided that whenever any person claimed to be held to labor or service, under the laws of any State, shall be permitted, by the person to whom such labor or service is claimed to be due, to take up arms against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or to work, or to be employed in or upon any fort, entrenchment, etc., or in any military or naval service whatever against the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the person to whom such labor is claimed to be due shall forfeit his claim, and to any attempt to enforce it a statement of the facts shall be a sufficient answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in his message of <dateStruct value="1861-12-03"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="3">3</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, stated that numbers of persons held to service had been liberated and were dependent on the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and must be provided for in some way. He recommended that steps be taken for colonizing them at some places in a climate congenial to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>As the <rs>President</rs> and the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> had declared this to be a war for the preservation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, it may not be <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> out of place to see what course they now undertook to pursue under the pretext of preserving the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It had been conceded in all time that the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> had no power to legislate on slavery in the states, and that this was a subject for state legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the powers not granted in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but <q direct="unspecified">reserved to the <name>States</name> respectively.</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> 
<p><rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, Article X.</p></note> All the powers of the federal government were delegated to it by the states, and all which were reserved were withheld from the federal government, as well in time of war as in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The conditions of peace or war made no change in the powers granted in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The attempt by Congress to exercise a power of confiscation, <num value="1">one</num> not granted to it, was therefore a mere usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The argument of forfeiture for treason does not reach the case, because there could be no forfeiture until after conviction, and the <rs>Constitution</rs> says, <q direct="unspecified">No attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/><hi rend="italics">Ibid</hi>., Article <num value="3">III</num>, section <num value="3">3</num>.</note> The confiscation act of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> undertook to convict and sentence without a trial, and entirely to deprive the owner of slaves of his property by giving final freedom to the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Still further to show how regardless the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> was of the limitations imposed upon it by the compact of Union, the reader is referred to the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> article of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> amendment, being <num value="1">one</num> of those cases in which the people of the several states, in an abundance of caution, threw additional protection around rights which the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> thought already sufficiently guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The last <num value="2">two</num> clauses of the article read thus: No person <q direct="unspecified">shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/></p> 
<p>Here was a political indictment and conviction by the <rs>Congress</rs> and <rs>President</rs>, with total forfeitures inflicted in palpable violation of each and of all the cited clauses of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><num value="1">One</num> can scarcely anticipate such effrontery as would argue that <q direct="unspecified">due process of law</q> meant an act of Congress, that judicial power could thus be conferred upon the <rs>President</rs>, and private property be confiscated for party success, without violating the <rs>Constitution</rs> which the actors had sworn to support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The unconstitutionality of the measure was so palpable that when the bill was under consideration <persName n="Stevens,,Thaddeus,,," id="n0129.0001.00006.00009" reg="default:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><foreName>Thaddeus</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, a member of Congress from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, said: <q direct="unspecified">I thought the time had come when the <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> laws of war were to govern our action; when constitutions, if they stood in the way of the laws of war in dealing with the enemy, had no right to intervene.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It is to be remembered in this connection that pillage and the wanton destruction of private property are not permitted by the laws of war among civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>When the leaders of a government aspire to the acquisition of absolute, unlimited power, and the sword is drawn to hew the way, it would be more logical and respectable to declare the laws silent than to attempt to justify unlawful acts by unwarranted legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The reader may observe the tenacity with which the authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and, behind them, the <rs>Northern</rs> states, clung to this theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Upon its strict maintenance depended the success of their bloody revolution to secure absolute supremacy over the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>He was several miles away from the bank of the <placeName reg="Poor Fork Cumberland River, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,2592540">Cumberland</placeName>, so that both the river and creek intervened between him and <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n0129.0002.00016.00055" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Early in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, I reached <placeName reg="Mill Springs, Wayne, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040311">Mill Springs</placeName>, and found, to my surprise, <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n0129.0002.00016.00057" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName> still on the right bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>He called on me immediately, and informed me that his messenger who bore back my order had lost several days in returning and that when it was received he supposed that I would arrive almost immediately; and, hoping to be able to convince me that it would be better to remain on the right bank, he had postponed crossing until, by a rise in the river, it had become impossible to do so; that all his artillery and a large portion of his wagons were on the right bank, and his only means of transferring them to the other bank were a small ferry-boat and a very small stern-wheel steamer, entirely inadequate to the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>I was dissatisfied, but, as I knew that the <rs>General</rs> had been actuated by pure motives, I accepted his excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Details were promptly placed in the woods, to prepare timber for flat-boats to transport the artillery and wagons to the left bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The weather was execrable, and the men unskilled, so that the work progressed slowly.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Such was the posture of affairs, when, on the <dateStruct value="-01-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, I was informed that <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0129.0002.00016.00058" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was approaching with a large force of all arms, and would encamp that night within a few miles of us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It rained violently throughout this day until late in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>It occurred to me that <placeName key="tgn,1133204" n="1.000 6" reg="fishing creek, kentucky, kentucky">Fishing Creek</placeName> must so rise as to render it impossible for <persName n="Schopf,,,,," id="n0129.0002.00016.00060" reg="mostcommon:Schopf,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>Schopf</surname></persName> to connect with <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0129.0002.00016.00061" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Acting upon this idea, I summoned a council of superior officers, and, laying before them the circumstances of the case, asked their advice.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Accordingly, at <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> in the night, we marched for the position of the enemy, ascertained to be some <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>We had scarcely taken up the line of march, when the rain began to fall, the darkness became intense, and the consequent confusion great, so that day dawned before we reached his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The attack, as a surprise, failed; nevertheless, it was promptly made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>It rained violently throughout the action, rendering all the flint-lock guns useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The men bearing them were allowed to fall back on the reserve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The action was progressing successfully, when the fall of <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n0129.0002.00017.00063" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName> was announced to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>My apprehensions were well founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>I found the line of battle in confusion and falling back, and, after a vain effort to restore the line, yielded to necessity, and, by the interposition of the reserve, covered the shattered line and effected my retreat to camp without loss.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>I reached camp late in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Not long afterward the enemy opened fire at long range; night coming on, he ceased to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The few shot and shells that fell in the camp so plainly demonstrated the demoralization of the men, that I doubted, even if I had had rations, which I had not, whether the camp could have been successfully defended for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. There was not, and had not been for some time in the camp, rations beyond the daily need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>This state of affairs was due to the exhaustion of the neighboring country, and the impracticability of the roads.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It became now my sole object to transfer the men with their arms, the cavalryhorses, and teams to the left bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>This was successfully accomplished by dawn of the next day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>I attributed the loss of the battle, in a great degree, to the inferiority of our arms and the untimely fall of <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n0129.0002.00017.00064" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>, who was known and highly esteemed by the men, who were almost all Tennesseeans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Under these circumstances, to attack <num value="1">one</num> portion of the enemy, when a junction with the other part could not be effected, was to act in accordance with <num value="1">one</num> of the best-settled rules of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The unforeseen accident of renewed rain, with intense darkness, delayed his march beyond reasonable expectation; whereas the whole force <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> should have reached the enemy's encampment before dawn, the advance of <num value="2">two</num> regiments only reached there after broad daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>To hesitate would have been to give the enemy time for preparation, and I think it was wisely decided to attack at once and rely upon the rear coming up to support the advance; the rear, encumbered with their artillery, were so far behind that, though the advance were successful in their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encounter, they did not receive the hoped &mdash; for support until they had suffered severely, and then the long-known and trusted commander of the forces there, the gallant and most estimable <persName n="Zollicoffer,,,,," id="n0129.0002.00018.00066" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>, fell&mdash;whence confusion resulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Had the whole force been in position at early dawn, so as to have surprised the enemy, the plan would have been executed, and victory would have been the probable result; after which, <persName n="Schopf,,,,," id="n0129.0002.00018.00068" reg="mostcommon:Schopf,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>Schopf</surname></persName>'s force might have been readily disposed of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>I therefore think the strategy not only defensible but commendable, and the affair to be ranked with <num value="1">one</num> of the many brilliant conceptions of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>I refrained, well knowing that heavy censures would fall upon me, but convinced that it was better to endure them for the present, and defer for a more propitious time an investigation of the conduct of the generals; for, in the mean time, their services were required and their influence was useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Let us now review the events which had brought such unmeasured censure on <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0129.0003.00037.00256" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> for some months preceding this correspondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>We have seen him, with a force numerically much inferior to that of the enemy in his front, holding the position of <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana" key="tgn,2031150">Bowling Green</placeName>, and, by active operations of detached commands, keeping up to foe and <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> friend the impression that he had a large army in position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>With selfsacrificing fortitude he remained silent under reproaches for not advancing to attack the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>When <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Forts Donelson</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName> were more immediately threatened, he gave reenforcements from his small command until his own line became more like <num value="1">one</num> of skirmishers than an entrenched line of battle; when those forts were surrendered, and his position became both untenable and useless, he withdrew in such order and with such skill that his retreat was unmolested by the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Though he continued to be the subject of unreasoning vituperation, he sought not to justify himself by blaming others, or telling what he would have done if his government had sent him the arms and munitions he asked for, but which his government he learned did not possess.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>There are yet those who, self-assured, demand why <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0129.0003.00038.00257" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,S.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> did not go himself to <persName n="Donelson,,,,," id="n0129.0003.00038.00258" reg="mostcommon:Donelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Donelson</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName>, and why his forces were not there concentrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>A slight inspection of the map would suffice to show that, <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana" key="tgn,2031150">Bowling Green</placeName> abandoned, the direct road to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> would be open to the advance of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n0129.0003.00038.00259" reg="mostcommon:Buell,D.,C.,,:1"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Then the forts, if held, would cease to answer their purpose, and, being isolated and between hostile armies above and below, would be not only valueless but only temporarily tenable; of his critics it may be asked, Who else than himself could, with the small force retained at <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana" key="tgn,2031150">Bowling Green</placeName>, have held the enemy in check so long, and at last have retired without disaster?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>To collect the widely separated troops of his command so as to form an army which might offer battle to the invading foe was a problem which must have been impossible, if the organized armies by which he was threatened had been guided by a capacity equal to his own. It was done, and with the genius of a great soldier he seized the opportunity, by the rapid combination of new levies and of forces never before united, to attack the armies of the enemy in detail while they were endeavoring to form a junction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The southwestern states presented a field peculiarly favorable for the application of a new power in war. Deep rivers, with banks frequently but little elevated above the water, traverse the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>On these rivers iron-plated steamboats with heavy guns may move with a rapidity incomparably greater than that of marching armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>It is as if forts, with armaments, garrison, and stores, were endowed with locomotion more swift and enduring than that of cavalry.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>My own opinion, founded upon the statements of those who were near him, and upon my long acquaintance with him and close observation of him under trying circumstances, is that his iron nerve and extraordinary concentration of mind made him regardless of his wound, in the fixed purpose to dislodge the enemy from his last position, and while thus struggling to complete the victory within his grasp, he unheedingly allowed his life blood to flow away.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>His plan was to throw forward his left across the <rs type="place">Meadow Bridge</rs>, drive back to the enemy's right flank, and then, crossing by the <rs type="place">Mechanicsville Bridge</rs> with another column, to <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> attack in front, hoping by his combined forces to be victorious on the north side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>; meanwhile the small force on the entrenched line south of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> should hold the left of the enemy in check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>I pointed out to him that our force and entrenched line between that left flank and <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was too weak for a protracted resistance, and if <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0129.0009.00110.01101" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:2"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was the man I took him for when I nominated him for promotion in a new regiment of cavalry, and subsequently selected him for <num value="1">one</num> of the <orgName n="Military Commission" type="commission">military commission</orgName> sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> during the <rs>War</rs> of the <name>Crimea</name>, as soon as he found that the bulk of our army was on the north side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, he would not stop to try conclusions with it there, but would immediately move upon his objective point, the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>The principle thus announced had regulated all the legislation of Congress from the beginning of its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> session in <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct> down to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> session of the <num value="30">Thirty</num>seventh Congress, commencing <dateStruct value="1861-07-04"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>A few months after the inaugural address above cited and the announcement of the fact above quoted were made, Congress commenced to legislate for the abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>If it had the power now to do what it before had not, whence was it derived?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>There had been no addition in the interval to the grants in the <rs>Constitution</rs>; not a word or letter of that instrument had been changed since the possession of the power was disclaimed; yet after <dateStruct value="1861-07-04"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, it was asserted by the majority in Congress that the government had power to interfere with slavery in the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>Whence came the change?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>The answer is, It was wrought by the same process and on the same plea that tyranny has ever employed against liberty and justice&mdash;the time-worn excuse of usurpers &mdash;necessity; and excuse which is ever assumed as valid, because the usurper claims to be the sole judge of his necessity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>The formula under which it was asserted was as follows: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>Whereas the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have been for some time past and now are opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, etc., by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings. . . </p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>Therefore, says the plea of necessity, a new power is this day found under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>This means that certain circumstances had transpired in a distant portion of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the powers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> had thereby become enlarged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>The inference follows with equal reason that, when the circumstances cease to exist, the powers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> will be contracted again to their normal state; that is, the powers of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> are enlarged or contracted according to circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>Mankind cannot be surprised at seeing a government administered on such an interpretation of powers blunder into a civil war, and approach the throes of dissolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>Nevertheless, these views were adopted by the <orgName n="United STATES Congress 37" type="congress">Thirty-seventh Congress of the United States</orgName>, and a system of legislation was devised which embraced the following usurpations: universal emancipation in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> through confiscation of private property of all kinds; prohibition of the extension of slavery to the territories; emancipation <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> of slavery in all places under the exclusive control of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; emancipation with compensation in the border states and in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>; practical emancipation to follow the progress of the armies; all restraints to be removed from the slaves, so that they could go free wherever they pleased, and be fed and clothed, when destitute, at the expense of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, literally to become a <q direct="unspecified">ward of the government.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/></p> 
<p>The emancipation of slaves through confiscation in states where the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>Heavy fines were imposed, and property was sold in fee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>It was private property, outside of the conflict of arms, and forfeited, not because it was the instrument of offense, but as a penalty for the assertion of his rights by the owner, which was imputed to him as a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>The practical operation, therefore, of these laws was that, under a Constitution which defined treason to consist in levying war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which would not suffer the traitor to be condemned except by the judgment of his peers, and, when condemned, would not forfeit his estate except during his life, the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> did proceed against <num value="6000000">six million</num> people, without indictment, without trial by jury, without the proof of <num value="2">two</num> witnesses, did adjudge our <num value="6000000">six millions</num> of people guilty of treason in levying war, and decree to deprive us of all our estate, real and personal, for life, and in fee, being nearly <num value="5000">five thousand</num> <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>The agitation of this subject brought out another still more alarming usurpation in Congress, and showed that the majority were ready to throw aside the last fragments of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in order to secure our subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>The argument for this usurpation was thus framed: assuming that the state of the <q direct="unspecified">nation</q> was <num value="1">one</num> of general hostility, and that, being so involved, it possessed the power of self-defense, it was asserted that the supreme power of making and conducting war was expressly placed in Congress by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>The ordinary provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs> peculiar to a state of peace, and all laws and municipal regulations, were to yield to the force of martial law, as resolved by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>The act emancipated all persons of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> descent held to service within the <rs>District</rs>, immediately upon its passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>On his approval of the act, the <rs>Executive</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> sent a message to Congress, in which he said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>For the previous <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> the subject had again and again been presented in Congress, and was always rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>This step showed the justness of our apprehensions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>Among the rights guaranteed to every citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, including the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, was the right of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>No <num value="1">one</num> could be deprived of his property by the government, except in the manner prescribed and authorized by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>Its words are these:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>Whenever it was necessary in the administration of affairs that the government should take private property for public use, it had the right to take that private property on the condition of making compensation for it, and on no other condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>Also, it could not be taken except for public use, even by making just compensation for it; nor could it be taken to be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>The simple and sole condition on which the inviolability of private property could be broken by the government itself was, that it was necessary for public use. Otherwise, there was no constitutional right on the part of the government to take the property at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>Again, this property, thus necessary, must be taken by due process of <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> law. The government had not the right to declare the mode, and arbitrarily fix the limit of price which should be paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>The negro could be taken only as other property, even admitting that he could be taken for emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>The due process of law required that the citizen's property be appraised judicially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>A court must proceed judicially in every case, summon a jury, appoint commissioners, and, under the supervision and sanction of the court, the valuation of the slave by them must proceed as it does in relation to any other property of the citizen that might be taken by the lawful exercise of the power of Congress or of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>Thus it will be seen that by this usurpation of power the <rs>Constitution</rs> was violated, not only by taking private property for other purposes than for public use, but in the neglect to observe the due process of law which the <rs>Constitution</rs> required.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>The next step in the usurpation of power for the destruction of the right of citizens to hold property in slaves was the passage by Congress of an act which declared that, after its passage&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>In this instance Congress passed an act declaring that they should not be delivered up on such claim; as a penalty for disobedience, any officer of the army or navy should be dismissed from the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>The words <q direct="unspecified">no person held to service</q> included every slave in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>In Article I, section <num value="9">9</num>, and in Article V, are exceptions suspending the operation of the general provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>The provision was designed to include every slave, and to be in force under all circumstances.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>Perhaps it may be urged, as an objection to this assertion, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were out of the <rs>Union</rs> and beyond the protection of the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>The attention of the reader is now invited to a series of usurpations in which the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was the principal actor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>On <dateStruct value="1862-03-06"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="6">6</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, he began a direct and unconstitutional interference with slavery by sending a message to Congress recommending the adoption of a resolution which should declare that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ought to cooperate with any state which might adopt the gradual abolition of slavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state in its discretion, to compensate for the inconvenience, public and private, produced by such change of system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>The reason given for the recommendation of the adoption of the resolution was that the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> would find its highest interest in such a measure as <num value="1">one</num> of the most important means of self-preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>He said, in explanation, that <q direct="unspecified">the leaders of the existing rebellion entertain the hope that this Government will ultimately be forced to acknowledge the independence of some part of the disaffected region, and that all the slave States north of such part will then say, <quote>The Union for which we have struggled being already gone, we now choose to go with the <rs>Southern</rs> section.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>To deprive them of this hope substantially ends the rebellion, and the initiation of emancipation deprives them of it and of all the <name>States</name> initiating it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/><pb id="p.152" n="152"/></p> 
<p>When it was asked where the power was found in the <rs>Constitution</rs> to appropriate the money of the people to carry out the purposes of the resolution, it was replied that the legislative department of the government was competent, under these words in the preamble of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">to provide for the general welfare,</q> to do anything and everything which could be considered as promoting the general welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>It was further said that this measure was to be consummated under the war power; that whatever was necessary to carry on the war to a successful conclusion might be done without restraint under the authority, not of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but as a military necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>It was further said that the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had thus far failed to meet the just expectations of the party which elected him to the office he held; that his friends were to be comforted by the resolution and the message, while the people of the border slave states could not fail to observe that with the comfort to the <rs>North</rs> there was mingled an awful warning to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>It was denied by the <rs>President</rs> that it was an interference with slavery in the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>It was an artful scheme to awaken a controversy in the slave states, and to commence the work of emancipation by holding out pecuniary aid as an inducement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>In every previous declaration the <rs>President</rs> had said that he did not contemplate any interference with domestic slavery within the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>The resolution was passed by large majorities in each house.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>This proposition of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0129.0012.00152.01429" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:10"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was wholly unconstitutional, because it attempted to do what was expressly forbidden by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>It proposed a contract between the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">state of Missouri</placeName> and the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which, in the language of the act, shall be <q direct="unspecified">irrepealable without the consent of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>The words of the <rs>Constitution</rs> are as follows: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation, grant letters of marque and reprisal, coin money, etc.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/> 
<p>Article <num value="1">I</num>, section <num value="10">10</num>.</p></note></p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>This is a prohibition not only upon the power of <num value="1">one</num> state to enter into a compact, alliance, confederation, or agreement with another state, but also with the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>Again, if the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">state of Missouri</placeName> could enter into an irrepealable agreement or compact with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, that slavery should not therein exist after the acceptance on the part of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> of the act, then it would be an agreement on the part of that state to surrender its sovereignty and make the state unequal in its rights of sovereignty with the other states of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>The other states would have the complete <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> right of sovereignty over their domestic institutions while the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">state of Missouri</placeName> would cease to have such right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>The whole system of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> would be abrogated by such legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>Again, it is a cardinal principle of the system that the people in their sovereign capacity may, from time to time, change and alter their organic law; a provision incorporated in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> that slavery should never thereafter exist in that state could not prevent a future <orgName n="Sovereign Convention" type="convention">sovereign convention</orgName> of its people from reestablishing slavery within its limits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>It will be observed, from what has been said in the preceding pages, that the usurpations by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, both by the legislative and executive departments, had not only been tolerated but approved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>Feeling itself, therefore, fortified in its unlimited power from <q direct="unspecified">necessity,</q> the wheels of the revolution were now to move with accelerated velocity in their destructive work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>Accordingly, a manifesto soon comes from the <rs>Executive</rs> on universal emancipation.

On <dateStruct value="-05-9"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="9">9th</day></dateStruct> the same officer issued another order, declaring <q direct="unspecified">the persons held as slaves in those States to be for ever free.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>The Executive of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, on <dateStruct value="-05-19"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="19">19th</day></dateStruct>, issued a proclamation declaring the order to be void, and said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>This pressure consisted in the demanding of his extreme partisans that the whole authority of the government should be exerted for the immediate and universal emancipation of the slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>By a reference to the statement of the causes of our withdrawal from the <orgName n="United States Union" type="union">Union of the United States</orgName>, it will be seen that <num value="1">one</num> of them consisted in the conviction that the newly-elected officers of the government would <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> wield its powers for the destruction of the institutions of the <rs>Southern</rs> states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>The facts already related in these pages furnish ample proofs of the justice and accuracy of this conviction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>The time was now close at hand when the mask was to be thrown off and, at a single dash of the pen, <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of our property was to be annihilated, the whole social fabric of the <rs>Southern</rs> states disrupted, all branches of industry disarranged, good order destroyed, and a flood of evils many times greater than the loss of property inflicted upon the people of the <rs>South</rs>, thus consummating the series of aggressions which had been inflicted for more than <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>. All constitutional protections were to be withdrawn, and the powers of a common government, created for common and equal protection to the interests of all, were to be arrayed for the destruction of our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>How easy it would have been for the <rs>Northern</rs> people, by a simple, honest obedience to the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to have avoided the commission of all these crimes and horrors!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>For the law which demands obedience to itself guarantees in return life and safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>It is not necessary to ask again where the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> or the <rs>Congress</rs> found authority for their usurpations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>But it should be remembered that, if the necessity which they pleaded was an argument to justify their violations of all the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the existence of such a necessity on their part was a sufficient argument to justify our withdrawal from union with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>If necessity on their part justified a violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, necessity on our part justified secession from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>If the preservation of the existence of the <rs>Union</rs> by coercion of the states was an argument to justify these violent usurpations by the <orgName n="U. S.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>The power of the river when in flood, and the driftwood it bore upon it, broke the raft; another was constructed which, when the driftwood accumulated upon it, met a like fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>At the then high stage of the river, all the land between it and the swamps was so saturated with water that regular approaches could not have been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>There were also several small river steamers which were lightly armed, and their bows were protected so that they could act as rams and otherwise aid in the defense of the river; from the reports received, however, they seem, with a few honorable exceptions, to have rendered little valuable service.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>In the meantime, while the fleet moved up the river, there was kept up from the mortars a steady bombardment on the forts, and these opened a fire on the columns of ships and gunboats which, from the failure to send down the fire rafts to light up the river, was less effective than it otherwise would have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>There was nothing to obstruct the ascent of the river between <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Forts Jackson</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017764" n="1.000 1" reg="Buras, Plaquemines, Louisiana">St. Philip</placeName> and the batteries on the river where the interior line of defense rested on its right and left banks, about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> below the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>The guns were not sufficiently numerous in these batteries to inspire much confidence; they were nevertheless well served until the ammunition was exhausted, after which the garrisons withdrew and made their way by different routes to join the forces withdrawn from New Orleans.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>Under the supposition entertained by the generals nearest to the operations, the greatest danger to New Orleans was from above, not <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> from below, the city; therefore, most of the troops had been sent from the city to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and <persName n="Hollins,Captain,,,," id="n0129.0014.00187.01557" reg="mostcommon:Hollins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hollins</surname></persName>, with the greater part of the river fleet, had gone up to check the descent of the enemy's gunboats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>Batteries like those immediately below the city had been constructed where the interior line touched the river above, and armed to resist an attack from that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>Doubtful as to the direction from which, and the manner in which, an attempt might be made to capture the city, such preparations as circumstances suggested were made against many supposable dangers by the many possible routes of approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>To defend the city from the land, against a bombardment by a powerful fleet in the river before it, had not been contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/>All the defensive preparations were properly, I think, directed to the prevention of a near approach by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>To have subjected the city to bombardment by a direct or plunging fire, as the surface of the river was then higher than the land, would have been exceptionally destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>Had the city been filled with soldiers whose families had been sent to a place of safety, instead of being filled with women and children whose natural protectors were generally in the army and far away, the attempt might have been justified to line the levee with all the effective guns and open fire on the fleet, at the expense of whatever property might be destroyed before the enemy should be driven away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>The case was the reverse of the hypothesis, and nothing could have been more unjust than to censure the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> for withdrawing a force large enough to induce a bombardment, but insufficient to repel it. His answer to the demand for the surrender showed clearly enough the motives by which he was influenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>His refusal enabled him to withdraw the troops and most of the public property, and to use them, with the ordnance and ordnance stores thus saved, in providing for the defense of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, but especially it deprived the enemy of any pretext for bombarding the town and sacrificing the lives of the women and children.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>The argument that the guns were not of sufficiently large caliber to stop the fleet is not convincing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>If all the guns had been of the largest size, that would not have increased the accuracy but would have diminished the rapidity of the fire, and therefore in the same degree would have lessened the chances of hitting objects in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>Further, it appears that the forts always crippled or repulsed any vessels which came up in daylight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>The forts would have been better able to resist bombardment if they had been heavily plated with iron; that would not, however, have prevented the fleet from passing them as they did. Torpedoes might have been placed on the bar at the mouth of the river before the enemy got possession of it, and subsequently, if attached to buoys, they might have been used in the deep channel above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>Many other things which were omitted might and probably would have been done had attention been earlier concentrated on the danger which at last proved fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>If the volunteer <orgName n="River Defense Fleet" type="fleet">river-defense fleet</orgName> was ineffective, as alleged, because it was not subject to the orders of the naval commander, that was an evil without a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>The governor of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> had arranged with the projectors that they should not be subject to the naval commander, and the alternative of not accepting them with that condition was that they <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> would not agree to convert their steamers into war vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>The fall of New Orleans was a great disaster, over which there was general lamentation, mingled with no little indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>The excited feeling demanded a victim, and conflicing testimony of many witnesses most nearly concerned made it convenient to select for censure those most removed and least active in their own justification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>To the embarrassments above mentioned were added interruptions by calling off the workmen occasionally for exercise and instruction as militiamen, the city being threatened by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>From these causes, unexpected delay in the completion of the ship resulted, regret for which increased as her most formidable character was realized.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>At the commencement of the war the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was not only without a navy, all the naval vessels possessed by the states having been, as explained elsewhere, left in the hands of our enemies; worse than this was the fact that shipbuilding had been almost exclusively done in the <rs>Northern</rs> states, so that we had no means of acquiring equality in naval power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>The numerous deep and wide rivers traversing the <rs>Southern</rs> states gave a favorable field for the operation of gunboats suited to such circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>The enemy rapidly increased their supply of these by building on the <rs>Western</rs> waters as well as elsewhere, and converting existing vessels into ironclad gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>The intrepidity and devotion of our people met the necessity by new expedients and extraordinary daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>[His lordship then read a passage from Story and others.] These gentlemen are authorities which show that, when <num value="2">two</num> belligerents are carrying on a war, a neutral power may supply, without any breach of international law and without a breach of the <rs>Foreign Enlistment Act</rs>, munitions of war&mdash;gunpowder, every description of arms, in fact, that can be used for the destruction of human beings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>Why should ships be an exception?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>I am of opinion, in point of law, they are not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>The title of an act is not at all times an exact indication or explanation of the act, because it is generally attached after the act is passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>But, in adverting to the preamble of the act, I find that provision is made against the equipping, fitting out, furnishing, and arming of vessels, because it may be prejudicial to the peace of <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty's</name> dominions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>The question I shall put to you is, Whether you think that vessel was merely in a course of building to be delivered in pursuance of a contract that was perfectly lawful, or whether there was any intention in the port of <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, or any other <name>English</name> port, that the vessel should be fitted out, equipped, furnished, and armed for purposes of aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>That appears to be a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>The statute is not made to provide means of protection for belligerent powers, otherwise it would have said, <q direct="unspecified">You shall not sell powder or guns, and you shall not sell arms</q>; and, if it had done so, all <placeName reg="Birmingham, Birmingham, England" key="tgn,7010955">Birmingham</placeName> would have been in arms against it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>The <rs>Alexandra</rs> was clearly nothing more than in the course of building.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3131"/>The reader will observe the promptitude with which the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> not only accorded belligerent rights, but, even more, recognized the independence of nations struggling for deliverance from oppressive rulers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>The instances of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> and the <name>South American</name> republic are well known, and that of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> must be familiar to everyone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/><num value="1">One</num> could scarcely believe, therefore, that the chief act of hostility, or rather, the great crime of the government of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the eyes of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, was the recognition by the latter of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as a belligerent power, and that a state of war existed between them and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>This was the constantly repeated charge against the <rs>British</rs> government in the dispatches of the <orgName n="U. S.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>What is alleged on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is, that the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation, which, by conceding belligerent rights to the insurgents, lifted them up for the purpose of insurrection to an equality with the nation which they were attempting to overthrow, was premature because it was unnecessary, and that it was, in its operation, unfriendly because it was premature.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>Again he says, and, if sincerely, shows himself to be utterly ignorant of the real condition of our affairs: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>Before the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation of neutrality, the disturbance in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was merely a local insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>It wanted the name of war to enable it to be a civil war and to live, endowed as such, with maritime and other belligerent rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>Without the authorized name, it might die, and was expected not to live and be a flagrant civil war, but to perish a mere insurrection.</p></quote> <pb id="p.232" n="232"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> extract in itself contains a fiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>If the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation possessed such force as to raise the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to an equality with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as a belligerent, perhaps another proclamation of the <rs>Queen</rs> might have possessed such force, if it had been issued, as to have lifted the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> from the state of equality to <num value="1">one</num> of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>This is a novel virtue to be ascribed to a <rs type="role2">Queen</rs>'s proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>This idea must have been borrowed from our neighbors of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, where a <hi rend="italics">pronunciamiento</hi> dissolves <num value="1">one</num> and establishes a rival administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>How much more rational it would have been to say that the resources and the military power of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> placed them, at the outset, on the footing of a belligerent, and the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation only declared a fact which the announcement of a blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had made manifest!&mdash;blockade being a means applicable only against a foreign foe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>Nevertheless the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, although refusing to concede belligerent rights to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, was very ready to take advantage of such concession by other nations whenever an opportunity offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>The voluminous correspondence of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> of the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>On this foundation was based the subsequent claim for damages, advanced by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> against that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>; for the pretended lack of <q direct="unspecified">due diligence</q> in watching the actions of this Confederate belligerent in her ports, she was mulcted in a heavy sum by the <rs>Geneva Conference</rs>, and paid it to the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>It is a remarkable fact that the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in no <num value="1">one</num> instance from the opening to the close of the war, formally spoke of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> or states as belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>Although on many occasions it acted with the latter as a belligerent, yet no official designations were ever given to them or their citizens but those of <q direct="unspecified">insurgents,</q> or <q direct="unspecified">insurrectionists.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>Perhaps there may be something in the signification of the words which, combined with existing circumstances, would express a state of affairs that the authorities of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were in no degree willing to admit, and vainly sought to prevent from becoming manifest to the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>The party or individuality against which the government of the <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was conducting hostilities consisted of the people within the limits of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3153"/>Was it against them as individuals in an unorganized condition, or as organized political communities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>In the former condition they might be a mob; in the latter condition they formed a state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3155"/>By the actions of unorganized masses may arise insurrections, and by the actions of organized people or states, arise wars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>The government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> adopted a fiction when it declared that the execution of the laws in certain states was impeded by <q direct="unspecified">insurrection.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>The persons whom it designated as insurrectionists were the organized people of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>The ballot boxes used at the elections were state boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>The judges who presided at the elections were state functionaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>The returns of the elections were made to the state officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>The oaths of office of those elected were administerd by state authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>They assembled in the legislative chambers of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>The results of their deliberations were directory to the state, judicial, and executive officers, and by them put in operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>Is it not evident that only by a fiction of speech can such proceedings be called an insurrection?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>Why, then, did an intelligent and powerful government like that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> so outrage the understanding of mankind as to adopt a fiction on which to base the authority and justification of its hostile action?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> is the result of a compact between the states&mdash;a written Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>It owes its existence simply to a delegation of certain powers by the respective states, which it is authorized to exercise for their common welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/><num value="1">One</num> of these powers is to <q direct="unspecified">suppress insurrections</q>; there is no power delegated to subjugate states, the authors of its existence, or to make war on any of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>If, then, without any delegated power or lawful authority for its proceedings, the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> commenced a war upon some of the states of the <rs>Union</rs>, how could it expect to be justified before the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>It became the aggressor&mdash;the <name>Attila</name> of the <rs>American</rs> continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>Its action inflicted a wound on the principles of constitutional liberty, a crushing blow to the hopes that men had begun to repose in this latest effort for self-government, which its friends should never forgive nor ever forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>To palliate the enormity of such an offense, its authors resorted to vehement denial that their hostile action was a war upon the states, and persistently asserted the fiction that their immense armies and fleets were merely a police authority to put down insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>They hoped to conceal from the observation of the <rs>American</rs> people that the contest, on the part of the central government, was for <pb id="p.234" n="234"/> empire, for its absolute supremacy over the state governments; that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was rolled up and laid away among the old archives; that the conditions of their liberty, in the future, were to be decided by the sword or by <q direct="unspecified">national</q> control of the ballot box.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>With like disregard for truth, our cruisers were denounced as <q direct="unspecified">pirates</q> by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>A pirate or armed piratical vessel, is by the law of nation the enemy of mankind, and can be destroyed by the ships of any nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>The distinction between a lawful cruiser and a pirate is that the former has behind it a government which is recognized by civilized nations as entitled to the rights of war, and from which the commander of the cruiser receives his commission or authority, but the pirate recognizes no government, and is not recognized by any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>As the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">attorney general</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> said in the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Alexandra,,,,," id="n0129.0017.00234.01830" reg="mostcommon:Alexandra,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexandra</surname></persName></hi> case: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>Therefore, as far as the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents were concerned, on the part of this and other governments, they were so far put on a level that each was to be considered as entitled to the right of belligerents&mdash;the <rs>Southern States</rs> as much as the other.</p></quote> </p>

<p>It has been stated that during the war of the colonies with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> many of the prizes of the colonial cruisers were destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>The laws of maritime war are well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>The enemy's vessel when captured becomes the property of the captor, which he may immediately destroy; or he may take the vessel into port, have it adjudicated by an <orgName n="Admiralty Court" type="court">admiralty court</orgName> as a lawful prize, and sold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>That adjudication is the basis of title to the purchaser against all former owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>The ministers of martial law are only the representatives of the conqueror, and they sit in his seat of authority to relieve him from the burden of excessive duties, and to administer justice to offenders against his authority and the social <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> welfare, during his presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>On such grounds the existence of such courts is justified; for the establishment of a court like this provisional <num value="1">one</num>, however, no legitimate authority is to be found either in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> or outside of it. <hi rend="italics">Inter arma silent leges</hi> is a maxim nearly <measure n="2000years" type="date">two thousand years</measure> old; it means that, under the exercise of military power, the civil administration ceases.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/>What, then, is this necessity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>Its definition would require an explanation, from the persons who act under it, of the objects for which, in every instance, they act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>It has fortified this with other maxims, such as <q direct="unspecified">Necessity is the plea of despotism</q> and <q direct="unspecified">Necessity knows no law.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>The fathers of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> sought to limit every grant of power so exactly that it should observe its bounds as invariably as a planetary body does its orbit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>It must be manifest to everyone that there has been a fatal subversion of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>In estimating the results of the war this is <num value="1">one</num> of the most deplorable, because it is self-evident that when a constitutional government once oversteps the limits fixed for the exercise of its powers, there is nothing beyond to check its further aggression, no place where it will voluntarily halt until it reaches the subjugation of all who resist the usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>This was the sole issue involved in the conflict of the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>Further, it is to be remembered that it does not come within the grants of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, consequently not within the powers of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to institute a republican form of government at any time or in any place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4239"/>They performed the positions with energy and skill, but were unsuccessful in obtaining our recognition as an independent power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4240"/>The usages of intercourse between nations require that official communication be made to friendly powers of all organic changes in the constitution of states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4241"/>To those who are familiar with the principles upon which the states known as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were originally constituted, as well as those upon which the <rs>Union</rs> was formed, the organic changes made by the secession and confederation of the <rs>Southern</rs> states are very apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4242"/>But to others an explanation may be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4243"/>Each of the states was originally declared to be sovereign and independent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4244"/>In this condition, at a former period, all of those then existing were severally recognized by name by the only <num value="1">one</num> of the powers which had denied their right to independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4245"/>This gave to each a recognized national sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4246"/>Subsequently they formed a compact of voluntary <pb id="p.312" n="312"/> union, whereby a new organization was constituted, which was made the representative of the individual states in all general intercourse with other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4247"/>So long as the compact continued in force, this agent represented merely the sovereignty of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4248"/>But, when a portion of the states withdrew from the compact and formed a new <num value="1">one</num> under the name of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, they had made such organic changes in their Constitution as to require official notice in compliance with the usages of nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4249"/>For this purpose the provisional government took early measures for sending to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> commissioners charged with the duty of visiting the capitals of the different powers and making arrangements for the opening of more formal diplomatic intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4250"/>Prior, however, to the arrival abroad of these commissioners, the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had addressed communications to the different cabinets of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in which it assumed the attitude of being sovereign over the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and alleged that these independent states were in rebellion against the remaining states of the <rs>Union</rs>, and threatened <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> with manifestations of its displeasure if it should treat the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as having an independent existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4251"/>It soon became known that these pretensions were not considered abroad to be absurd as they were known to be at home; nor had <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> yet learned what reliance was to be placed in the official statements of the cabinet at <placeName key="tgn,7013962;tgn,2024666;tgn,2558074" n="0.031 000000.4680	placename;tgn,7013962;washington, district of columbia,District of Columbia,United States,North and Central America;0.005 000000.0780	placename;tgn,2024666;washington, wilkes, georgia,Wilkes,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.003 000000.0390	placename;tgn,2558074;old washington, mason, kentucky,Mason,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America" reg="washington, district of columbia,District of Columbia,United States,North and Central America;washington, wilkes, georgia,Wilkes,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;old washington, mason, kentucky,Mason,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4252"/>The delegation of power granted by the states to the general government to represent them in foreign intercourse had led <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> nations into the grave error of supposing that their separate sovereignty and independence had been merged into <num value="1">one</num> common sovereignty, and had ceased to have a distinct existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4253"/>Under the influence of this error, which all appeals to reason and historical fact were vainly used to dispel, our commissioners were met by the declaration that foreign governments could not assume to judge between the conflicting representations of the <num value="2">two</num> parties as to the true nature of their previous relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4254"/>The governments of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> accordingly signified their determination to confine themselves to recognizing the self-evident fact of the existence of a war, and to maintain a strict neutrality during its progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4255"/>Some of the other powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> pursued the same course of policy, and it became apparent that by some understanding, express or tacit, <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> had decided to leave the initiative in all action touching the contest on this continent to the <num value="2">two</num> powers just named, who were recognized to have the largest interests involved, both by reason of proximity to and of the extent of intimacy of their commercial relations with the states engaged in war. <pb id="p.313" n="313"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4256"/>It was manifest that the course of action adopted by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, while based on an apparent refusal to determine the question or to side with either party, was, in point of fact, an actual decision against our rights and in favor of the groundless pretensions of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4257"/>It was a refusal to treat us as an independent government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4258"/>If we were independent states, the refusal to entertain with us the same international intercourse which was maintained with our enemy was unjust, and was injurious in its effects, whatever might have been the motive which prompted it. Neither was it in accordance with the high moral obligations of that international code, whose chief sanction is the conscience of sovereigns and the public opinion of mankind, that those eminent powers should have declined the performance of a duty peculiarly incumbent on them, from any apprehension of the consequences to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4259"/><num value="1">One</num> immediate and necessary result of their declining the responsibility of a decision, which must have been adverse to the extravagant pretensions of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, was the prolongation of hostilities to which our enemies were thereby encouraged, and which resulted in scenes of carnage and devastation on this continent and of misery and suffering on the other such as have scarcely a parallel in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4260"/>Had those powers promptly admitted our right to be treated as all other independent nations, none can doubt that the moral effect of such action would have been to dispel the pretension under which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> persisted in their efforts to accomplish our subjugation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4261"/>There were other matters in which less than justice was rendered to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by <q direct="unspecified">neutral</q> <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and undue advantage conferred on the aggressors in a wicked war. At the inception of hostilities, the inhabitants of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were almost exclusively agriculturists; those of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were to a large extent mechanics, merchants, and navigators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4262"/>We had no commercial marine, while their merchant vessels covered the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4263"/>We were without a navy, while they had powerful fleets built by the money we had in full share contributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4264"/>The power which they possessed for inflicting injury on our coasts and harbors was thus counter-balanced in some measure by the exposure of their commerce to attack by private armed vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4265"/>It was known to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that within a very few years past the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had peremptorily refused to accede to proposals for the abolition of privateering, on the ground, as alleged by them, that nations owning powerful fleets would thereby obtain undue advantage over those possessing inferior naval force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/>Yet no sooner was war flagrant between the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than the maritime powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> <pb id="p.314" n="314"/> issued orders prohibiting either party from bringing prizes into their ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>This prohibition, directed with apparent impartiality against both belligerents, was in reality effective against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> only, for they alone could find a hostile commerce on the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4268"/>Merely nominal against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the prohibition operated with intense severity on the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by depriving it of the only means of maintaining its struggle on the ocean against the crushing superiority of naval force possessed by its enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>The value and efficiency of the weapon which was thus wrested from our grasp by the combined action of <q direct="unspecified">neutral</q> <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> powers, in favor of a power which professes openly its intention of ravaging their commerce by privateers in any future war, is strikingly illustrated by the terror inspired among commercial classes of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by a single cruiser of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/><num value="1">One</num> small steamer, commanded by officers and manned by a crew who were debarred by the closure of neutral ports from the opportunity of causing captured vessels to be condemned in their favor as prizes, sufficed to double the rates of <rs n="marine insurance" type="product">marine insurance</rs> in Northern ports, and consign to forced inaction numbers of Northern vessels, in addition to the direct damage inflicted by captures at sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>But it was especially in relation to the so-called blockade that the policy of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> powers was so shaped as to cause the greatest injury to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and to confer signal advantages on the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4272"/>A few words in explanation may here be necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4273"/>Prior to the year <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> the principles regulating this subject were to be gathered from the writings of eminent publicists, the decisions of admiralty courts, international treaties, and the usages of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4274"/>The uncertainty and doubt which prevailed in reference to the true rules of maritime law, in time of war, resulting from the discordant and often conflicting principles announced from such varied and independent sources, had become a grievous evil to mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4275"/>Whether a blockade was allowable against a port not invested by land as well as by sea, whether a blockade was valid by sea if the investing fleet was merely sufficient to render ingress to the blockaded port evidently dangerous, or whether it was further required for its legality that it should be sufficient <q direct="unspecified">really to prevent access,</q> and numerous other similar questions, had remained doubtful and undecided.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>Animated by the highly honorable desire to put an end <q direct="unspecified">to differences of opinion between neutrals and belligerents, which may occasion serious difficulties and even conflicts</q> (such was the official language), the <num value="5">five</num> great powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, together with <placeName reg="Sardegna" key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Turkiye" key="tgn,1000144">Turkey</placeName>, adopted in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> the following declaration of principles: <pb id="p.315" n="315"/> <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/>Not only did this solemn declaration announce to the world the principles to which the signing powers agreed to conform in future wars, but it contained a clause to which these powers gave immediate effect, and which provided that the states not parties to the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName> should be invited to accede to the declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>Under this invitation every independent state in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> yielded its assent&mdash;at least, no instance is known to me of a refusal; the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, while declining to assent to the proposition which prohibited privateering, declared that the <num value="3">three</num> remaining principles were in entire accordance with their own views of international law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4283"/>No instance is known in history of the adoption of rules of public law under circumstances of like solemnity, with like unanimity, and pledging the faith of nations with a sanctity so peculiar.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4284"/>When, therefore, this Confederacy was formed, and when neutral powers, while deferring action on its demand for admission into the family of nations, recognized it as a belligerent power, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> made informal proposals, about the same time, that their own rights as neutrals should be guaranteed by our acceding, as belligerents, to the declaration of principles made by the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/>The request was addressed to our sense of justice, and therefore met immediate and favorable response in the resolutions of the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">provisional Congress</orgName> of <dateStruct value="1861-08-13"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="13">13</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, by which all the principles announced by the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName> were adopted as the guide of our conduct during the war, with the sole exception of that relative to privateering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>As the right to make use of privateers was <num value="1">one</num> in which neutral nations had, as to the then existing war, no interest; as it was a right which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had refused to abandon, and which they remained at liberty to employ against us; as it was a right of which we were already in actual enjoyment, and which we could not be expected to renounce <hi rend="italics">flagrante bello</hi> against an adversary possessing an overwhelming superiority of naval forces&mdash;it was reserved with entire confidence that neutral nations could not fail to perceive that just reason existed for the reservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>Nor was this confidence misplaced; the official documents published by the <rs>British</rs> government contained the expression of the satisfaction of that <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> government with the conduct of officials who conducted successfully the delicate transaction confided to their charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>These solemn declarations of principle, this implied agreement between the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and the <num value="2">two</num> powers just named, were suffered to remain inoperative against the menaces and outrages on neutral rights committed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with unceasing and progressing arrogance during the whole period of the war. Neutral <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> remained passive when the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with a naval force insufficient to blockade effectively the coast of a single state, proclaimed a paper blockade of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of miles of coast, extending from the <name>Capes</name> of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> to those of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and encircling the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7021537" n="1.000 56" reg="key west, florida keys, monroe, florida">Key West</placeName> to the mouth of the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>Compared with this monstrous pretension of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the blockades known in history under the names of the <name>Berlin</name> and Milan Decrees, and the <rs>British Orders</rs> in Council, in the years <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>, sink into insignificance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>Those blockades were justified by the powers that declared them, on the sole ground that they were retaliatory; yet they have since been condemned by the publicists of those very powers as violations of international law. It will be remembered that those blockades evoked angry remonstrances from neutral powers, among which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were the most conspicuous, and were in their consequences the chief cause of the war between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>; they also formed <num value="1">one</num> of the principal motives that led to the declaration of the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, in the fond hope of imposing an enduring check on the very abuse of maritime power which was renewed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, under circumstances and with features of aggravated wrong without precedent in history.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>The importance of this change was readily illustrated by taking <num value="1">one</num> of our ports as an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>There was <q direct="unspecified">evident danger,</q> in entering the port of <placeName key="tgn,7014631" n="1.000 4" reg="wilmington, new hanover, north carolina">Wilmington</placeName>, from the presence of a blockading force, and by this test the blockade was effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/><q direct="unspecified">Access is not really prevented</q> by the blockading fleet to the same port; steamers were continually arriving and departing, so that, tried by this test, the blockade was ineffective and invalid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>Thus, while every energy of our country was evoked in the struggle for maintaining its existence, the neutral nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> pursued a policy which, nominally impartial, was practically most favorable to our enemies and most detrimental to us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>The exercise of the neutral right of refusing entry into their ports to prizes taken by both belligerents was especially hurtful to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>It was sternly adhered to and enforced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>The assertion of the neutral right of commerce with a belligerent, whose ports are not blockaded by fleets sufficient really to prevent access to them, would have been eminently beneficial to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and only thus hurtful to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>The duty of neutral states to receive with cordiality and recognize with respect any new confederation that independent states may think proper to form, was too clear to admit of denial, but its postponement was equally beneficial to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and detrimental to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/>If these calamities affected America only, these sufferings of a friendly nation would be enough to excite the anxiety and sympathy of the <rs>Emperor</rs>; but <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> also had suffered in <num value="1">one</num> of the principal branches of her industry, and her artisans had been subjected to most cruel trials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>The forces of the <num value="2">two</num> sides had hitherto fought with balanced success, and the latest accounts did not show any prospect of a speedy termination of the war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>It has been shown that the governments of the states were instituted to secure certain unalienable rights of the citizens with which they were endowed by their Creator, and that among these rights were life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that they derived their just powers from the consent of the governed; that these powers were organized by the citizens in such form as seemed to them most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/>The duty of the state government is to give to its citizens perfect and complete security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5179"/>The commission of such a subversion of the peaceful and fraternal states of this once happy republic is fearlessly charged upon the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as in itself constituting a monstrous crime against constitutional liberty; it is asserted that, when the circumstances attending the deed are considered&mdash;the rage against a whole people, the pillage, the arson, the inciting of servile war, the slaughter of defenseless noncombatants, the devastation of whole peaceful regions, the indiscriminate destruction of property&mdash;no parallel can be found in the annals of mankind.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5188"/>It partakes of the nature of an incorporation for certain purposes, beyond which it has neither influence nor authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5189"/>It is an anomaly among governments, and arose out of the articles of agreement made by certain friendly states, which proposed to form a society of states and invest a common agent with specified functions of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5190"/>Its duration was intended to be permanent, as it was hoped thus to promote the peaceful ends for which it was <pb id="p.383" n="383"/> established; to have declared it perpetual, however, would have been to deny the right of a people to alter or abolish their government when it should cease to answer the ends for which it was instituted.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5191"/>The objects which its creation was designed to secure to the states and their people were of a truly peaceful nature, and commended themselves to the approbation of men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5198"/>How distinct in its nature and objects was the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from the governments of the states, may be seen from that which has already been said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5199"/>The former was established by common consent to look after the common interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5200"/>It was to make peace or war with foreign nations, protect the frontiers, extend the boundaries, decide disputes between citizens of different states, and administer general affairs in a manner to promote the peace, the order, and the happiness of all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5201"/>How wofully the confiding people were betrayed when the usurper came, let some of the <rs>Northern</rs> states answer!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5202"/>Now let us proceed to notice the acts of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which subjugated the state governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5203"/>The details in the case of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> have been already stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5204"/>In that instance, the government of the state, which derived its powers from the consent of the governed, so that they were <q direct="unspecified">just powers,</q> round, in the discharge of its duty to protect the institutions of its people, that there were no means by which it could fulfill that duty but by a withdrawal from the <rs>Union</rs>, so as to be rid of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and thus escape the threatened dangers of usurpation and sectional hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5205"/>It therefore resolved to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, and the people gave their assent to this resolution; the state therefore no longer considered itself a member of the <rs>Union</rs>, nor recognized the laws and authority of its government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5206"/>The government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, then, with a powerful military force, planted itself at <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, the state capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5207"/>It refused to recognize the state government, or any organization under it, as having any existence, or to recognize the people otherwise than as a hostile community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5208"/>It said to them, in effect: <q direct="unspecified">I am the sovereign and you are the subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5209"/>If you are stronger than I am, then drive me out of the state; if I am stronger than you are, then I demand an unconditional surrender to my sovereignty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5210"/>It is evident that the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was not there by the consent of those who were to be governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5211"/>It had not, therefore, any <q direct="unspecified">just powers</q> of government within the <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">state of Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5212"/>For, says the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi> of our fathers, governments <q direct="unspecified">derive their <q direct="unspecified">just powers</q> from the consent of the governed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5213"/>It is further evident that, by this action, the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> denied the fundamental principle of popular liberty &mdash;that the people are the source of all political power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5214"/>In this instance it not only subverted the state government, but carried that subversion to the extent of annihilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5215"/>It therefore proceeded to establish a new order of affairs, founded, not on the principle of the sovereignty of the people, which was wholly rejected, but on the assumption of sovereignty in the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5216"/>It appointed its military governor the head of the new order, and recognized no civil or political existence in any man, except some of its notorious adherents, until, betraying the state, he had taken an oath of allegiance to the sovereignty of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5217"/>Now commenced a system of denial of <pb id="p.385" n="385"/> unalienable rights, for the methods of the usurper are the same everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5218"/>Freedom of speech was suppressed by the imposition of fines on those using <q direct="unspecified">seditious</q> language, and the demand of security for their future humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5219"/>The freedom of the press was suppressed by suspension of publications and the confiscation of the offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5220"/>Personal liberty was destroyed by arrests, imprisonment, and exile.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5221"/>In process of time an effort was made to erect a form of state government which should be subservient and subject to the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5222"/>For this purpose no <num value="1">one</num> could be a voter until he had bound himself by an oath to support and defend the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5223"/>Under the state governments, manhood, which came by nature, and residence, which came by <num value="1">one</num>'s own will, were sufficient qualifications for the voter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5224"/>It will be apparent from this statement that the voter's right to cast his ballot came not to him as an unalienable right, but rested upon the permission of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as his sovereign, to whom his allegiance was due, and to whom he was required, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, to bind himself by an oath of allegiance without any mention whatever of a state government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5225"/>Indeed, a little later, the same oath was required with additional conditions before a man was permitted to vote for a state <orgName n="Constitutional Convention" type="convention">constitutional convention</orgName>, or for delegates to such a convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5226"/>These conditions were that he would faithfully support all acts of Congress and all proclamations of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> passed or made during the rebellion, having reference to slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5227"/>Thus the voter's right was made to rest, not only upon his binding himself in allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as his sovereign, but in the binding by oath of his consent to certain unconstitutional acts and proclamations expressly designed to destroy <num value="1">one</num> of the most important institutions of the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5228"/>This, sustained by a military force, was exacted by the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> as the lord paramount&mdash;the sovereign within the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5229"/>At the same time the action of the voter, which should be perfectly free and unconstrained (for, under American political principles, he is the sovereign over all), is limited and bound down by an oath faithfully to support certain acts to which it was presumable he had ever been conscientiously opposed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5230"/>Under these circumstances, who was the sovereign in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5231"/>The government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5232"/>Where was the government of the <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">state of Tennessee</placeName> and the sovereign people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5233"/>The former was subverted and overthrown, and the later subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5234"/>The approval by <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, under such circumstances, of Article <num value="13">XIII</num> as an amendment of the <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> prohibiting the existence of slavery, was of no force; consent given by a party under constraint has neither legal nor moral validity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5235"/>The state constitution was so amended as to contain certain new provisions prescribed by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by a so-called <orgName n="Delegates Convention" type="convention">convention of delegates</orgName> elected by the voters above specified, then submitted to these voters and said to be ratified by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5236"/>They were little more in numbers than a handful of the people of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5237"/>Was this a Constitution amended and approved by the consent of the people of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, the only sovereigns known under our institutions, or was it a Constitution amended and voted for by a small fraction of its population acting under the authority of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as the only sovereign in the state?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5238"/>Admitting, even, that those who voted for the amended Constitution were the only legal voters in the state, the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was no less an unlawful intruder and usurper when it prescribed the amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and designated the voters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5239"/>Nevertheless, this work was recognized by it as constituting a republican state government under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5240"/>Let us next notice some points in the subversion of the state government of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>. <num value="1">One</num> of the earliest steps taken for a civil organization, after the occupation of New Orleans, was to make a registration of voters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5241"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> was in possession by military force, and the object was to secure its permanent supremacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5242"/>Therefore the oath which was administered to the person applying for registration contained this condition: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5243"/>I now register myself as a voter, freely and voluntarily, for the purpose of organizing a State government in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, loyal to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5244"/>It was also announced, with the approval of the <rs type="role" reg="military-Governor">military governor</rs>, that any person swearing falsely to any material part of the oath would be deemed guilty of perjury, and be liable to prosecution and punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5245"/>The effect of this measure was to secure a registration only of persons who would maintain the supremacy of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>A proclamation was next issued by the commander of the <orgName n="U. S. Forces" type="org">United States forces</orgName> for an election of state officers under the laws and constitution of the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>It was declared that these officers, when thus elected, would constitute the so-called civil government of the state, under the constitution and laws of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <q direct="unspecified">except so much of the said Constitution and laws as recognize, regulate, or relate to slavery,</q> which were also declared to be inoperative and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/>It was further provided, in the same proclamation, as follows: <pb id="p.387" n="387"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/>In order that the organic law of the <rs>State</rs> may be made to conform to the will of the people and harmonize with the spirit of the age, as well as to maintain and preserve the ancient landmarks of civil and religious liberty, an election of delegates to a convention for the revision of the <rs>Constitution</rs> will be held. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>The effect of these acts was to establish a number of persons, pledged to support the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as the only qualified voters in the state, and to elect so-called state officers and delegates to a so-called <orgName n="Constitutional Convention" type="convention">constitutional convention</orgName> by their ballots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5251"/>But this was a work that could be done only by the sovereign people acting through their lawful state government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>It was not so done, because the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with a powerful military force, had taken possession of New Orleans, refused to recognize the officers of the state government, and sought to capture and imprison them, although it recognized the validity of the state constitution in part, and commanded these things to be done as if it was the ultimate sovereign over all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>Thus the government of the state was subverted, the constitution of the state in part set aside, and the sovereignty of the people trampled down by a power that had no rightful authority for such acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>Subsequently, a so-called convention was held, a so-called new constitution adopted complying with the views of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the amendment to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> as above mentioned was adopted, the state Representatives were admitted to seats in Congress, and the people acquiesced in the fraud which they had not the power to correct.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5493"/>The writ must be suspended by an act of Congress, which can be passed only when Congress is in session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5494"/>This suspension must be positive and absolute by Congress, not indefinite and dependent on any future contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5497"/>Congress alone by positive enactment can suspend the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6304"/>My information led me to believe that the condition of that army, in all that constitutes efficiency, was satisfactory, and that the men were anxious for an opportunity to retrieve the loss of prestige sustained in the disastrous <rs n="Battle of Missionary Ridge" type="battle">battle of Missionary Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6305"/>I was also informed that the enemy's forces, then occupying <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, <pb id="p.461" n="461"/> <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Fairfield, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013453">Bridgeport</placeName>, and <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n0129.0034.00461.03875" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,R.,Randolph,,:1"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName>, with a detached force at <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, were weaker in numbers than at any time since the <rs n="Battle of Missionary Ridge" type="battle">battle of Missionary Ridge</rs>, and that they were especially deficient in cavalry and in artillery and train horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6306"/>I desired, therefore, that prompt and vigorous measure be taken to enable our troops to commence active operations against the enemy as early as practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6307"/>It was important to guard against the injurious results to the morale of the troops which always attend a prolonged season of inactivity; the recoverey of the territory in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, which we had been compelled to abandon, and on the supplies of which the proper subsistence of our armies mainly depended, imperatively demanded an onward movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6308"/>I believed that, by a rapid concentration of our troops between the scattered forces of the enemy, without attempting to capture his entrenched positions, we could compel him to accept battle in the open field, and that, should we fail to draw him out of his entrenchments, we could move upon his line of communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6309"/>The Federal force at <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> depended mainly for support on its connection with that at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and both were wholly dependent on uninterrupted communication with <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6310"/>If, by interposing our force, we could separate these <num value="2">two</num> bodies of the enemy, and cut off his communication from <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> by destroying the railroad, both conditions would be fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6311"/>Of the practicability of this movement I had little doubt; of its expediency, if practicable, there could be none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6312"/>I impressed repeatedly upon <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0129.0034.00461.03876" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> by letter, and by officers of my staff and others sent to him by me for the purpose of putting him in possession of these views, the importance of a prompt aggressive movement by the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6322"/>He believed that the <rs>Federal</rs> forces in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> were not weaker, but if anything stronger, than at <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>; that defeat beyond the <rs>Tennessee</rs> would probably prove ruinous to us, resulting in the loss of his army, the occupation of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> by the enemy, the <q direct="unspecified">piercing of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in its vitals,</q> and the loss of all the southwestern territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6323"/>He proposed, therefore, to stand on the defensive until strengthened, <q direct="unspecified">to watch, prepare, and strike</q> as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6324"/>As soon as reenforced, he declared his purpose to advance to <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName>, attack there, and, if successful, as he expected to be, to strike at <placeName reg="Cleveland, Bradley, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098519">Cleveland</placeName>, cut the railroad, control the river, and thus isolate <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, as a consequence forcing his antagonist to give battle on this side of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6326"/>These operations, he thought, would result in forcing the <rs>Federal</rs> army to evacuate the <rs type="place">Tennessee Valley</rs> and make an advance into the heart of the state safely practicable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6327"/>The irreparable loss of time in making any forward movement as desired having sufficed for the combinations which rendered an advance across the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName> no longer practicable, I took prompt measures to enable <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0129.0034.00462.03881" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> to carry out immediately his own proposition to strike <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName> and then at <placeName reg="Cleveland, Bradley, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098519">Cleveland</placeName>, proposing that <persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n0129.0034.00462.03882" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,S.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> should threaten <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, <persName n="Forrest,General,,,," id="n0129.0034.00462.03883" reg="nearbymention:Forrest,N.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName> advance into or threaten <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, and <persName n="Roddy,General,,,," id="n0129.0034.00462.03884" reg="mostcommon:Roddy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Roddy</surname></persName> hold the enemy in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Alabama</placeName>, and thus prevent his concentration in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6748"/>Their action on the subject of these differences is delayed and embarrassed by the necessity of referring each subject as it arises to superior authority for decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6749"/>I believe that I have just grounds of complaint against the officers and forces under your command for breach of the terms of the cartel, and, being myself ready to execute it at all times in good faith, I am not justified in doubting the existence of the same disposition on your part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6750"/>In addition to this matter, I have to complain of the conduct of your officers and troops in many parts of the country, who violate all the rules of war, by carrying on hostilities, not only against armed foes, but against non-combatants, aged men, women, and children; while others not only seize such property as is required for the use of your forces, but destroy all private property within their reach, even <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs>; and openly avow the purpose of seeking <pb id="p.503" n="503"/> to subdue the population of the districts where they are operating, by the starvation that must result from the destruction of standing crops and agricultural tools.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6751"/>Still, again, others of your officers in different districts have recently taken the lives of prisoners who fell into their power, and justify their act by asserting a right to treat as spies the <rs type="role" reg="military-Officer">military officers</rs> and enlisted men under my command, who may penetrate for hostile purposes into States claimed by me to be engaged in the warfare now waged against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and claimed by the latter as having refused to engage in such warfare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6752"/>I have heretofore, on different occasions, been forced to make complaint of these outrages, and to ask from you that you should either avow or disclaim having authorized them, and have failed to obtain such answer as the usages of civilized warfare require to be given in such cases.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/>These usages justify, and indeed require, redress by retaliation, as the proper means of repressing such cruelties as are not permitted in warfare between <name>Christian</name> peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>I have, notwithstanding, refrained from the exercise of such retaliation, because of its obvious tendency to lead to a war of indiscriminate massacre on both sides, which would be a spectacle so shocking to humanity and so disgraceful to the age in which we live and the religion we profess, that I can not contemplate it without a feeling of horror that I am disinclined to doubt you would share.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6765"/>From the correspondence of our exchange commissioner, <persName n="Ould,Judge,,,," id="n0129.0035.00504.04311" reg="nearbymention:Ould,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName>, it appears that, from the date of the cartel on <dateStruct value="1862-07-22"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="22">22</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, until the summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, we had an excess of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6766"/>During the interval deliveries were made as fast as the enemy furnished transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6767"/>Indeed, upon more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion they were urged to send increased means of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6768"/>It was never alleged that we failed or neglected to make prompt deliveries of prisoners who were not held under charges when they had the excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6769"/>On the other hand, the cartel was openly and notoriously violated by the <rs>Washington</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6770"/>Officers and men were kept in confinement, sometimes in irons or doomed to cells, without charge or trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6771"/>Many officers were kept in confinement even after the notices published by the enemy had declared them to be exchanged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6772"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, the authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> insisted upon exchanges limited to such as were held in confinement on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6773"/>This was resisted as in violation of the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6774"/>Such a construction not only kept in confinement the excess on either side, but ignored all paroles which were held by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6775"/>These were very many, being the paroles of officers and men who had been released on capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6776"/>The authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> at that time held few or no paroles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6777"/>They had all, or nearly all, been surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6778"/>We gave prisoners as an equivalent for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6779"/>As long as we had the excess of prisoners, matters went on smoothly enough; as soon as the posture of affairs in that respect was changed, however, the cartel could no longer be observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6780"/>So long as the <orgName n="U. S.

His views, therefore, were to be regarded merely as his own, and said they were perhaps merely the dreams of an old man, etc. He said, despairing of being able to see me, he had determined to write to me, and had the rough draft of a letter which he had prepared, and asked permission to read it. Soon after commencing to do so, he said (pleasantly) that he found his style was marked by his old pursuit, and that the paper appeared too much like an editorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6949"/>He omitted, therefore, portions of it, reading what he considered the main points of his proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6950"/>He had recognized the difference of our positions as not entitling him to a response from me to the arguments and suggestions which he desired to offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6951"/>I therefore allowed him to read without comment on my part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6952"/>When he had finished, I inquired as to his main proposition, the cessation of hostilities and the union of the military forces for the common purpose of maintaining the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Monroe</placeName> doctrine</q>&mdash;how that object was to be reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6953"/>He said that both the political parties of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> asserted the <rs>Monroe</rs> doctrine as a cardinal point of their creed; that there was a general desire to apply it to the case of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6954"/>For that purpose a secret treaty might be made, etc. I called his attention to my past efforts for negotiation, and my inability to see&mdash;unless <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00518.04413" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s course in that regard should be changed&mdash; how we were to take the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6955"/>He expressed the belief that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00518.04414" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would now receive commissioners, but subsequently said he could not give any assurance on that point, and proposed to return to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to explain his project to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00518.04415" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and notify me, if his hope proved well founded, that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00518.04416" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would now agree to a conference for the purpose of entering into negotiations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6956"/>He affirmed that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00518.04417" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> did not sympathize with the radical men who desired the devastation and subjugation of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, but that he was unable to control the extreme party, which now had great power in the <rs>Congress</rs>, and would at the next session have still more; referred to the existence of <num value="2">two</num> parties in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, to the reluctant nomination of <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00518.04418" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> to be <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief-Justice</rs>, etc. For himself, he avowed an earnest desire to stop the further effusion of blood, as <num value="1">one</num> every drop of whose blood was Southern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6957"/>He expressed the hope that the pride, the power, and the honor of the <rs>Southern States</rs> should suffer no shock; looked to the extension of Southern territory even to the <name>Isthmus</name> of <placeName reg="Darien, McIntosh, Georgia" key="tgn,2022633">Darien</placeName>, and hoped, if his views found favor, that his wishes would be realized; reiterated the idea of State sovereignty, with illustrations, and accepted the reference I made to explanation given in the <q direct="unspecified">Globe,</q> when he edited it, of the proclamation of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0129.0036.00518.04419" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,T.,J.,,:5"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6958"/>When his attention was called to the brutal atrocities of their armies, especially the fiendish cruelty shown to helpless women and children, as the cause of a <pb id="p.519" n="519"/> deep-seated hostility on the part of our people, and an insurmountable obstacle to an early restoration of fraternal relations, he admitted the necessity for providing a new channel for the bitter waters, and another bond than that of former memories and interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6959"/>This was supposed to be contained in the proposed common effort to maintain the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Monroe</placeName> doctrine</q> on the <rs>American Continent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6960"/>It was evident that he counted on the disintegration of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> if the war continued, and that in any event he regarded the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> as doomed to extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6961"/>I thought any remark by me on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proposition would lead to intimations in connection with public men which I preferred not more distinctly to hear than as manifested in his <rs n="General Remarks" type="misc">general remarks</rs>; on the latter point, for the reason stated, the inequality of his responsibility and mine, I preferred to have no discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6962"/>The only difficulty which he spoke of as insurmountable was that of existing engagements between <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> powers and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6963"/>This point, when referred to a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time as the dreaded obstacle to a secret treaty which would terminate the war, was met by me with a statement that we had now no such complication, were free to act as to us should seem best, and desired to keep state policy and institutions free from foreign control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6964"/>Throughout the conference <persName n="Blair,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00519.04420" reg="nearbymention:Blair,F.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName> appeared to be animated by a sincere desire to promote a pacific solution of the existing difficulty, but claimed no other power than that of serving as a medium of communication between those who had thus far had no intercourse, and were therefore without the co-intelligence which might secure an adjustment of their controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6965"/>To his hopeful anticipation in regard to the restoration of fraternal relations between the sections, by the means indicated, I replied that a cessation of hostilities was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step toward the substitution of reason for passion, of sense of justice for a desire to injure, and that, if the people were subsequently engaged together to maintain a principle recognized by both, if together they should bear sacrifices, share dangers, and gather common renown, that new memories would take the place of those now planted by the events of this war, and might, in the course of time, restore the feelings which preexisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6966"/>But it was for us to deal with the problems before us, and leave to posterity questions which they might solve, though we could not; that, in the struggle for independence by our colonial fathers, had failure instead of success attended their effort, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, instead of a commerce which has largely contributed to her prosperity, would have had the heavy expense of numerous garrisons, to hold in subjection a people who deserved to be free and had resolved not to be subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6967"/>Our conference ended with no other result than an agreement that he would learn whether <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00519.04421" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would adopt his (<persName n="Blair,Mister,,,," id="n0129.0036.00519.04422" reg="nearbymention:Blair,F.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName>'s) project, and send or receive commissioners to negotiate for a peaceful solution of the questions at issue; that he would report to him my readiness to enter upon negotiations, and that I knew of no insurmountable obstacle to such a treaty of peace as wuld secure greater advantage to both parties than any result which arms could achieve.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6999"/>Several causes may be conjecturally assigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7000"/>The commissioners were well known in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, had there held high <pb id="p.522" n="522"/> positions, and, so far as there was any peace party there, might have been expected to have influence with its members; a more important inquiry, however, is: If <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0129.0036.00522.04456" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> previously had determined to hear no proposition for negotiation, and to accept nothing less than an unconditional surrender, why did he propose to receive informally our agent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7001"/>If there was nothing to discuss, the agent would have been without functions.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7338"/>The general plan of the assault and battle was this: To take the fort by a rush across the narrow space that lay between it and <persName n="Colquitt,,,,," id="n0129.0038.00553.04731" reg="mostcommon:Colquitt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colquitt</surname></persName>'s Salient, and then surprise and capture, by a stratagem, the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-fort">commanding forts</rs> in the rear, thus opening a way for our troops to pass to the rear, and upon the flank of the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0129.0038.00553.04732" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, which was to be broken to pieces by a concentration of all the forces at my command moving upon that flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7339"/>During the night of the <num value="25" type="ordinal">25th</num> my preparations were made for the movement before daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7340"/>I placed <num value="3">three</num> officers in charge of <num value="3">three</num> separate bodies of men, and directed them, as soon as the lines of <placeName reg="Fort Steadman">Fort Steadman</placeName> should be carried by the assaulting column, to rush through the gap thus produced to the <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role" reg="rear-fort">rear forts</rs>&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of these officers and bodies of men to go to each fort, and to approach them from their rear by the only avenue left open and seize those forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7341"/>A guide was placed with each of these officers, who was to conduct him and his troops to the rear of the front, <pb id="p.554" n="554"/> which he was to surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7342"/>A body of the most stalwart of my men was organized to move in advance of all the troops, armed with axes, with which they were to cut down the obstruction of sharpened and wire-fastened rails in front of the enemy's lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7343"/>Next to these were to come <num value="300">three hundred</num> men, armed with bayonets fixed and empty muskets, who were to mount and enter the fort as the axemen cut away the obstruction of sharpened rails, bayoneting the pickets in front and gunners in the fort if they resisted, or sending them to our rear if they surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7344"/>Next were to cross the <num value="3">three</num> officers and their detachments, who were to capture the <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role" reg="rear-fort">rear forts</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7345"/>Next, a division of infantry was to cross, moving by the left flank, so as to be in position when halted, and fronted to move without any confusion or delay immediately down <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00554.04733" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s lines, toward his left, capturing his troops, or forcing them to abandon their works and form under our advancing fire at right angles to his line of works.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7346"/>Next was to cross the cavalry, who were to ride to the rear, cut the enemy's telegraph-lines, capture his pontoons, and prevent or delay the crossing of reenforcements from beyond the <rs>Appomattox</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7347"/>Next, my whole force was to swell the column of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7348"/>Then, as the front of our lines were cleared of the enemy's troops, our divisions were to change front and join in pressing upon the enemy and driving him farther from the other wing of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00554.04734" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, and widening the breach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7349"/>Strips of white cloth were tied around the shoulders of our men, so as to designate them in the darkness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7350"/>Just before daylight, when all was ready, I gave the signal, and the axemen rushed across, followed by the bodies armed with bayonets and empty muskets, who captured and sent to the rear the enemy's pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7351"/>The axemen cut away the sharpened rails so rapidly as scarcely to cause a halt of the troops following, who mounted the enemy's works and seized his guns and gunners in the fort, clearing the way and giving safe passage to detachments and larger bodies which were to follow and which did follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7352"/>The fort and most of the lines between the fort and the river were captured with the loss of but <num value="1">one</num> man, so far as I could learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7353"/>We <measure n="11" type="captured">captured eleven</measure> heavy guns, <num value="9">nine</num> mortars, about <measure n="700" type="prisoners">seven hundred prisoners</measure>, as I now recollect, among whom was the brigadier commanding that portion of the line, <persName n="McLaughlin,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00554.04735" reg="mostcommon:McLaughlin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaughlin</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7354"/>Everything was moving as well as I could have desired, when, <num value="1">one</num> after another, all <num value="3">three</num> of the officers, sent to the rear to capture by strategem the <rs type="role" reg="rear-fort">rear forts</rs>, sent messengers to inform me that they had passed successfully through the lines of the enemy's reserves in rear of <placeName reg="Fort Steadman">Fort Steadman</placeName>, and were certainly beyond the <rs type="role" reg="rear-fort">rear forts</rs>, but that their guides had been lost or had deserted, and that they could not find the forts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7355"/>Although I heard nothing afterward of these guides, yet I did learn of the fate of the <num value="3">three</num> officers and their commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7356"/>Some were shot down after daylight, some were captured, and a few, very few, made their way back to our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7357"/>The failure of that portion of the programme left, of course, these <num value="3">three</num> forts manned by the enemy, and his heavy guns made it impossible to carry out literally the details of the plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7358"/>Then a large body of the troops sent by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00554.04736" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> from <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00554.04737" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> were delayed by the breaking down of trains, or by some other cause, and did not arrive at the appointed hour, which caused so great a delay that we did not get in the fort and upon the enemy's flank at as early an <pb id="p.555" n="555"/> hour as was expected, and daylight found us with the plan only half executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7359"/>At daylight, all the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-fort">commanding forts</rs> in the rear, which we had failed to capture, opened upon <placeName reg="Fort Steadman">Fort Steadman</placeName> and that portion of the enemy's lines held by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7360"/>Reenforcements were rapidly brought up, so that it became too hazardous, as <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00555.04738" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> thought, to go forward or attempt it. So he ordered me back (I may say here that I entirely approved of this decision of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00555.04739" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>). Up to this hour we had lost but few men, and these had been killed or wounded mainly by artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7361"/>But now the enemy's infantry came up and made several assaults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7362"/>They were repulsed by our troops in <placeName reg="Fort Steadman">Fort Steadman</placeName> and in the enemy's works on its flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7363"/>It was in the effort to withdraw the troops that our principal loss occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7364"/>A raking fire was kept up across the intervening space over which we had moved in capturing the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7365"/>I was wounded in recrossing to <persName n="Colquitt,,,,," id="n0129.0038.00555.04740" reg="mostcommon:Colquitt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colquitt</surname></persName>'s Salient, and many of our men were killed and wounded in making the same passage back to our works.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7366"/>As I said at the outset, this attack was regarded by both <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00555.04741" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and myself as very hazardous; but it seemed necessary to do more than sit quietly waiting for <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0129.0038.00555.04742" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to move upon our right, while each day was diminishing our strength by disease and death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7367"/>Let me also add that the movement made at <placeName reg="Hare's Hill">Hare's Hill</placeName> must have proved a great success but for the unforeseen and unavoidable miscarriages to which I have referred.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7839"/>On the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">second</day></dateStruct> or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day after leaving <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, I heard that a band of marauders, supposed to be stragglers and deserters from both armies, were in pursuit of my family, whom I had not seen since they left <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, but of whom I heard, at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, that they had gone with my private secretary and <measure n="7" type="paroled">seven paroled</measure> men, who generously offered their services as an escort, to the <rs type="place">Florida coast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7840"/>Their route was to the east of that I was pursuing, but I immediately changed direction and rode rapidly across the country to overtake them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7841"/>About nightfall the horses of my escort gave out, <pb id="p.594" n="594"/> but I pressed on with <persName n="Reagan,Secretary,,,," id="n0129.0040.00594.05168" reg="nearbymention:Reagan,John,H.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Reagan</surname></persName> and my personal staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7842"/>It was a bright moonlight night, and just before day, as the moon was sinking below the tree-tops, I met a party of men in the road, who answered my questions by saying they belonged to an Alabama regiment; that they were coming from a village not far off, on their way homeward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7843"/>Upon inquiry being made, they told me they had passed an encampment of wagons, with women and children, and asked me if we belonged to that party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7844"/>Upon being answered in the affirmative, they took their leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7845"/>After a short time I was hailed by a voice which I recognized as that of my private secretary, who informed me that the marauders had been hanging around the camp, and that he and others were on post around it, and were expecting an assault as soon as the moon went down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7846"/>A silly story had got abroad that it was a treasure train, and the <hi rend="italics">auri sacra fames</hi> had probably instigated these marauders, as it subsequently stimulated <persName n="Wilson,General,J.,H.,," id="n0129.0040.00594.05169" reg="default:Wilson,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, to send out a large cavalry force to capture the same train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7847"/>For the protection of my family I traveled with them <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, when, believing that they had passed out of the region of marauders, I determined to leave their encampment at nightfall, to execute my original purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7848"/>My horse and those of my party proper were saddled preparatory to a start, when <num value="1">one</num> of my staff, who had ridden into the neighboring village, returned and told me he had heard that a marauding party intended to attack the camp that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7849"/>This decided me to wait long enough to see whether there was any truth in the rumor, which I supposed would be ascertained in a few hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7850"/>My horse remained saddled and my pistols in the holsters, and I lay down, fully dressed, to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7851"/>Nothing occurred to rouse me until just before dawn, when my coachman, a free colored man, who faithfully clung to our fortunes, came and told me there was firing over the branch, just behind our encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7852"/>I stepped out of my wife's tent and saw some horsemen, whom I immediately recognized as cavalry, deploying around the encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7853"/>I turned back and told my wife these were not the expected marauders, but regular troopers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7854"/>She implored me to leave her at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7855"/>I hesitated, from unwillingness to do so, and lost a few precious moments before yielding to her importunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7856"/>My horse and arms were near the road on which I expected to leave, and down which the cavalry approached; it was therefore impracticable to reach them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7857"/>I was compelled to start in the opposite direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7858"/>As it was quite dark in the tent, I picked up what was supposed to be my <q direct="unspecified">raglan,</q> a waterproof, light overcoat, without sleeves; it was subsequently found to be my wife's, so very like my own as to <pb id="p.595" n="595"/> be mistaken for it; as I started, my wife thoughtfully threw over my head and shoulders a shawl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7859"/>I had gone perhaps <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards</measure> when a trooper galloped up and ordered me to halt and surrender, to which I gave a defiant answer and, dropping the shawl and raglan from my shoulders, advanced toward him; he leveled his carbine at me, but I expected, if he fired, he would miss me, and my intention was in that event to put my hand under his foot, tumble him off on the other side, spring into his saddle, and attempt to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7860"/>My wife, who had been watching when she saw the soldier aim his carbine at me, ran forward and threw her arms around me. Success depended on instantaneous action, and, recognizing that the opportunity had been lost, I turned back and, the morning being damp and chilly, passed on to a fire beyond the tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7861"/>Our pursuers had taken different roads, and approached our camp from opposite directions; they encountered each other and commenced firing, both supposing they had met our armed escort, and some casualties resulted from their conflict with an imagiary body of Confederate troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7862"/>During the confusion, while attention was concentrated upon me, except by those who were engaged in pillage, <num value="1">one</num> of my aides, <persName n="Wood,Colonel,J.,Taylor,," id="n0129.0040.00595.05170" reg="expanded:Wood,John,Taylor,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>Taylor</foreName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, with <persName n="Barnwell,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0129.0040.00595.05171" reg="mostcommon:Barnwell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Barnwell</surname></persName>, walked off unobserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7863"/>His daring exploits on the sea had made him, on the part of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, an object of special hostility, and rendered it quite proper that he should avail himself of every possible means of escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7865"/>He subsequently claimed credit, in a conversation with me, for the forbearance shown by his men in not shooting me when I refused to surrender.</p>

For this reason I will postpone, to some other time and more appropriate place, any further notice of the story and its variations, all the spawn of a malignity that shames the civilization of the age.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7867"/>On our way to <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> we received the proclamation of <rs type="role2">President</rs></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7869"/>Some troops by the wayside had the proclamation, which was displayed with vociferous demonstrations of exultation over my capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7870"/>When we arrived at <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> I was conducted to the hotel where <persName n="Wilson,General,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05178" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> had his quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7871"/>A strong guard was in front of the entrance, and when I got down to pass in, it opened ranks, facing inward, and presented arms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7872"/>A commodious room was assigned to myself and family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7873"/>After a while the steward of the hotel called and inquired whether I would dine with <persName n="Wilson,General,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05179" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> or have dinner served with myself and family in my room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7874"/>I chose the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7875"/>After dinner I received a message from <persName n="Wilson,General,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05180" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, asking whether he should wait upon me, or whether I would call upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7877"/>After some conversation in regard to former times and our common acquaintance, he referred to the proclamation offering a reward for my capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7878"/>Taking it for granted that any significant remark of mine would be reported to his government, and fearing that I might never have another opportunity to give my opinion to <persName n="Johnston,,A.,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05182" reg="default:Johnston,A.,,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, I told him there was <num value="1">one</num> man in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who knew that proclamation to be false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7879"/>He remarked that my expression indicated a particular person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7880"/>I answered that I did, and the person was the <num value="1">one</num> who signed it, for he at least knew that I preferred <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05183" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7881"/>Some other conversation then occurred in regard to the route on which we were to be carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7882"/>Having several small children, <num value="1">one</num> of them an infant, I expressed a preference for the easier route by water, supposing then, as he seemed to do, that I was to go to <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7883"/>He manifested a courteous, obliging temper, and, either by the authority with which he was invested or by obtaining it from a higher power, my preference as to the route was accorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7884"/>I told him that some of the men with me were on parole, and that they all were riding their own horses&mdash;private property&mdash;that I would be glad if they should be permitted to retain them, and I have a distinct recollection that he promised me it should be done; I have since learned that they were all deprived of their horses, and some who were on parole, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>., <persName n="Moran,Major,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05184" reg="mostcommon:Moran,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Moran</surname></persName>, <persName n="Moody,Captain,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05185" reg="mostcommon:Moody,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Moody</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hathaway,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05186" reg="mostcommon:Hathaway,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Hathaway</surname></persName>, <persName n="Howell,Midshipman,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05187" reg="mostcommon:Howell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Midshipman">Midshipman</roleName> <surname>Howell</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Messec,Private,,,," id="n0129.0040.00596.05188" reg="mostcommon:Messec,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Private">Private</roleName> <surname>Messec</surname></persName>, who had not violated their obligations of parole, but had been captured because they were found voluntarily traveling with my family to protect them from marauders, were sent with me as prisoners of war, and all incarcerated, in disregard of the <pb id="p.597" n="597"/> protection promised when they surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7887"/>His fidelity was rewarded by a long and rigorous imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7888"/>At <placeName key="tgn,2096511" n="1.000 4" reg="port royal, beaufort, south carolina">Port Royal</placeName> we were transferred to a seagoing vessel, which, instead of being sent to <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>, was brought to anchor at <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>. <num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num> all my companions in misfortune were sent away, we knew not whither, leaving on the vessel only <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0129.0040.00597.05195" reg="nearbymention:Clay,C.,C.,,"><surname>Clay</surname></persName>, his wife, me and my family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7890"/>Not knowing that the government was at war with women and children, I asked that my family might be permitted to leave the ship and go to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> or <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>, or to some place where they had acquaintances, but this was refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7892"/>This was also denied; finally, I was informed that they must return to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> on the vessel by which we came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7893"/>This was an old transport ship, hardly seaworthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7894"/>My last attempt was to get for them the privilege of stopping at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, where they had many personal friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7895"/>This also was refused&mdash;why, I did not then know, have not learned since, and am unwilling to make a supposition, as none could satisfactorily account for such an act of inhumanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7896"/>My daily experience as a prisoner shed no softer light on the transaction, but served only to intensify my extreme solicitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7897"/>Bitter tears have been shed by the gentle, and stern reproaches have been made by the magnanimous, on account of the needless torture to which I was subjected, and the heavy fetters riveted upon me, while in a stone casemate and surrounded by a strong guard; all these were less excruciating than the mental agony my captors were able to inflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7898"/>It was long before I was permitted to hear from my wife and children; this, and things like this, were the powers which education added to savage cruelty; I do not propose now and here to enter upon the story of my imprisonment, however, or more than merely to refer to other matters which concern me personally, as distinct from my connection with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7951"/>The last resort was that of hanging, and the officers and men of the triumphant <orgName>army of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0129.0041.00602.05217" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName></orgName> were engaged in erecting gallows and hanging up these faithful and devoted servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7952"/>They were strung up until life was nearly extinct, when they were let down, suffered to rest awhile, then threatened and hung up again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7953"/>It is not surprising that some should have been left hanging so long that they were taken down dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7954"/>Coolly and deliberately these hardened men proceeded on their way, as if they had perpetrated no crime, and as if the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of heaven would not pursue them with his vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7955"/>But it was not alone the poor blacks (to whom they professed to come as liberators) that were thus subjected to torture and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7956"/>Gentlemen of high character, pure and honorable and gray-headed, unconnected with the military, were dragged from their fields or their beds, and subjected to this process of threats, beating, and hanging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7957"/>Along the whole track of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0129.0041.00602.05218" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, traces remain of the cruelty and inhumanity practiced on the aged and the defenseless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7958"/>Some of those who were hung up died under the rope, while their cruel murderers have not only been left unreproached and unhung, but have been hailed as heroes and patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7959"/>The list of those martyrs whom the cupidity of the officers and men of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0129.0041.00602.05219" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> sacrificed to their thirst for <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, is large and most revolting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7960"/>If the editors of this paper will give their consent to publish it, I will give it in full, attested by the names of the purest and best men and women of our Southern land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7961"/>I, who have been a witness to these acts of barbarity that are revolting to every feeling of humanity and mercy, was doomed to feel in my own person the effects of the avarice, cruelty, and despotism which characterized the men of that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7962"/>I was the only male guardian of the refined and delicate females who had fled there for shelter and protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7963"/>I soon ascertained the plan that was adopted in this wholesale system of plunder, insult, blasphemy, and brutality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7964"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> party that came was headed by officers, from a colonel to a lieutenant, who acted with seeming politeness, and told me that they only came to secure our firearms, and when these were delivered up nothing in the house should be touched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7965"/>Out of the house, they said, they were authorized to press forage for their large army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7966"/>I told them that along the whole line of the march of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0129.0041.00602.05220" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, from <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2095532" n="1.000 23" reg="cheraw, chesterfield, south carolina">Cheraw</placeName>, it had been ascertained that ladies had been robbed and personally insulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7967"/>I asked for a guard to protect the females.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7968"/>They said that there was no necessity for this, as the men dare not act contrary to orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7969"/>If any did not treat the ladies with proper respect, I might blow their brains out. <q direct="unspecified">But,</q> said I, <q direct="unspecified">you have taken away our arms, and we are defenseless.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7970"/>They did not blush much, and made no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7971"/>Shortly after this came the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> party, before the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7972"/>They demanded the keys of the ladies' drawers, took away such articles as they wanted, then locked the drawers and put the keys in their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7973"/>In the mean time, they gathered up the spoons, knives, forks, towels, <rs n="table cloths" type="product">table-cloths</rs>, etc. As they were carrying them off, I appealed to the officers of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> party; they ordered the men to put back the things; the officer of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> party said he would see them d&mdash;&mdash;d <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; and, without further ado, packed them up, and they glanced at each other and smiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7974"/><pb id="p.603" n="603"/> The elegant carriage and all the vehicles on the premises were seized and filled with bacon and plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7975"/>The smokehouses were emptied of their contents and carried off. Every head of poultry was seized and flung over their mules, and they presented the hideous picture in some of the scenes in <quote><num value="40">Forty</num> Thieves.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7976"/>Every article of harness they did not wish was cut in pieces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7977"/>By this time the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> parties had left, and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> appeared on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7978"/>They demanded the keys of the drawers, and, on being informed that they had been carried off, coolly and deliberately proceeded to break open the locks, took what they wanted, and when we uttered words of complaint were cursed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7979"/>Every horse, mule, and carriage, even to the carts, was taken away, and, for <num value="100">hundred</num> of miles, the last animal that cultivated the widow's corn-field, and the vehicles that once bore them to the house of worship, were carried off or broken into pieces and burned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7980"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> party that came promised to leave <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> provisions, the rest they carried off. An hour afterward, other hordes of marauders from the same army came and demanded the last pound of bacon and the last quart of meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7981"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, the negroes were dressed in their best suits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7982"/>They were kicked, and knocked down and robbed of all their clothing, and they came to us in their shirtsleeves, having lost their hats, clothes, and shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7983"/>Most of our own clothes had been hid in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7984"/>The negroes who had assisted in removing them were beaten and threatened with death, and compelled to show them where they were concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7985"/>They cut open the trunks, threw my manuscripts and devotional books into a mud-hole, stole the ladies' jewelry, hair ornaments, etc., tore many garments into tatters, or gave the rest to the negro women to bribe them into criminal intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7986"/>These women afterward returned to us those articles that, after the mutilations, were scarcely worth preserving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7987"/>The plantation, of <num value="160">one hundred and sixty</num> negroes, was some distance from the house, and to this place successive parties of <num value="50">fifty</num> at a time resorted for <num value="3">three</num> long days and nights, the husbands and fathers being fired at and compelled to fly to the woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7988"/>Now commenced scenes of licentiousness, brutality, and ravishment that have scarcely had an equal in the ages of heathen barbarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7989"/>I conversed with aged men and women, who were witnesses of these infamous acts of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0129.0041.00603.05221" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s unbridled soldiery, and several of them, from the cruel treatment they had received, were confined to their beds for weeks afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7990"/>The time will come when the judgment of Heaven will await these libidinous, beastly barbarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7991"/>During this time, the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> party, whom, I was informed by others, we had the most reason to dread, had made their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7992"/>They came, as they said, in the name of the great <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0129.0041.00603.05222" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who was next to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> Almighty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7993"/>They came to burn and lay in ashes all that was left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7994"/>They had burned bridges and depots, cotton-gins, mills, barns, and stables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7995"/>They swore they would make the d&mdash;&mdash;d rebel women pound their corn with rocks, and eat their raw meal without cooking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7996"/>They succeeded in <num value="1000">thousands</num> of instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7997"/>I walked out at night, and the innumerable fires that were burning as far as the eye could reach, in hundreds of places, illuminated the whole heavens, and testified to the vindictive barbarity of the foe. I presume they had orders not to burn occupied houses, but they strove all in their power to compel families to fly from their houses that they might afterward burn them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7998"/>The neighborhood was <pb id="p.604" n="604"/> filled with refugees who had been compelled to fly from their plantations on the seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7999"/>As soon as they had fled, the torch was applied, and, for hundreds of miles, those elegant mansions, once the ornament and pride of our inland country, were burned to the ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8000"/>All manner of expedients were now adopted to make the residents leave their homes for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8001"/>I heard them saying, <q direct="unspecified">This is too large a house to be left standing, we must contrive to burn it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8002"/>Canisters of powder were placed all around the house, and an expedient resorted to that promised almost certain success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8003"/>The house was to be burned down by firing the outbuildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8004"/>These were so near each other that the firing of the <num value="1">one</num> would lead to the destruction of all. I had already succeeded in having a few bales of cotton rolled out of the building, and hoped, if they had to be burned, the rest would also be rolled out, which could have been done in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> by several <num value="100">hundred</num> men who were looking on, gloating over the prospect of another elegant mansion in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> being left in ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8005"/>The torch was applied, and soon the large storehouse was on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8006"/>This communicated to several other buildings in the vicinity, which, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, were burned to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8007"/>At length the fire reached the smoke-house, where they had already carried off the bacon of <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> hogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8008"/>This was burned, and the fire was now rapidly approaching the kitchen, which was so near the dwelling-house that, should the former burn, the destruction of the large and noble edifice would be inevitable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8009"/>A captain of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> service, a native of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, whose name I would like to mention here, if I did not fear to bring down upon him the censure of the abolitionists as a friend to the rebels, mounted the roof, and the wet blankets we sent up to him prevented the now smoking roof from bursting into flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8010"/>I called for help to assist us in procuring water from a deep well; a young lieutenant stepped up, condemned the infamous conduct of the burners, and called on his company for aid; a portion of them came cheerfully to our assistance; the wind seemed almost by a miracle to subside; the house was saved, and the trembling females thanked <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for their deliverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8011"/>All this time, about <num value="100">one hundred</num> mounted men were looking on, refusing to raise a hand to help us; laughing at the idea that no efforts of ours could save the house from the flames.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8012"/>My trials, however, were not yet over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8013"/>I had already suffered much in a pecuniary point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8014"/>I had been collecting a library on natural history during a long life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8015"/>The most valuable of these books had been presented by various societies in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, etc., who had honored me with membership, and they or the authors presented me with these works, which had never been for sale, and could not be purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8016"/>My herbarium, the labor of myself and the ladies of my house for many years, was also among these books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8017"/>I had left them as a legacy to the library of the <rs type="place">Newbury College</rs>, and concluded to send them at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8018"/>They were detained in <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName>, and there the torch was applied, and all were burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8019"/>The stealing and burning of books appear to be <num value="1">one</num> of the programmes on which the army acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8020"/>I had assisted in laying the foundation and dedicating the <orgName n="Lutheran Church" type="church">Lutheran Church</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName>, and there, near its walls, had recently been laid the remains of <num value="1">one</num> who was dearer to me than life itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8021"/>To set that <orgName n="Brick Church" type="church">brick church</orgName> on fire from below was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8022"/>The building stood by itself on a square but little built up. <num value="1">One</num> of <pb id="p.605" n="605"/> <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0129.0041.00605.05223" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s burners was sent up to the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8023"/>He was seen applying the torch to the cupola.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8024"/>The church was burned to the ground, and the grave of my loved <num value="1">one</num> desecrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8025"/>The story circulated, that the citizens had set their own city on fire, is utterly untrue, and only reflects dishonor on those who vilely perpetrated it. <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0129.0041.00605.05224" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had his army under control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8026"/>The burning was by his orders, and ceased when he gave the command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8027"/>I was now doomed to experience in person the effects of avarice and barbarous cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8028"/>The robbers had been informed in the neighborhood that the family which I was protecting had buried <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">one hundred thousand dollars</measure> in <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8029"/>They <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> demanded my watch, which I had effectually secured from their grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8030"/>They then asked me where the money had been hid. I told them I knew nothing about it, and did not believe there was a <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure> worth in all, and what there was had been carried off by the owner, <persName n="Cash,Colonel,,,," id="n0129.0041.00605.05225" reg="mostcommon:Cash,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Cash</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8031"/>All this was literally true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8032"/>They then concluded to try an experiment on me which had proved so successful in hundreds of other instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8033"/>Coolly and deliberately they prepared to inflict torture on a defenseless, gray-headed old man. They carried me behind a stable, and once again demanded where the money was buried, or <q direct="unspecified">I should be sent to hell in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8034"/>They cocked their pistols and held them to my head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8035"/>I told them to fire away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8036"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, a square-built, broad-faced, large-mouthed, clumsy lieutenant, who had the face of a demon, and who did not utter <num value="5">five</num> words without an awful blasphemy, now kicked me in the stomach until I fell breathless and prostrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8037"/>As soon as I was able, I rose again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8038"/>He once more asked me where the silver was. I answered as before, <q direct="unspecified">I do not know.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8039"/>With his heavy, elephant foot he now kicked me on my back until I fell again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8040"/>Once more I arose, and he put the same question to me. I was nearly breathless, but answered as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8041"/>Thus was I either kicked or knocked down <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8042"/>I then told him it was perfectly useless for him to continue his threats or his blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8043"/>He might shoot me if he chose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8044"/>I was ready and would not budge an inch, but requested him not to bruse and batter an unarmed, defenseless old man. <q direct="unspecified">Now,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">I'll try a new plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8045"/>How would you like to have both your arms cut off,</q> He did not wait for an answer, but with his heavy sheathed sword, struck me on my left arm, near the shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8046"/>I heard it crack; it hung powerless by my side, and I supposed it was broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8047"/>He then repeated the blow on the other arm. The pain was most excruciating, and it was several days before I could carve my food or take my arm out of a sling, and it was <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> for weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8048"/>(I refer to <persName n="Kollock,Doctor,,,," id="n0129.0041.00605.05226" reg="mostcommon:Kollock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Kollock</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,2095532" n="1.000 23" reg="cheraw, chesterfield, south carolina">Cheraw</placeName>.)

Our horses and carriages had all been taken away, and I was too much bruised to be able to walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8054"/>The other young officers came crowding around me very officiously, telling me that they would represent the case to the <rs>General</rs>, <pb id="p.606" n="606"/> and that they would have him shot by <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8055"/>I saw the winks and glances that were interchanged between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8056"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> gave a different name to the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8057"/>The brute remained unpunished, as I saw him on the following morning, as insolent and as profane as he had been on the preceding day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8058"/>As yet, no punishment had fallen on the brutal hyena, and I strove to nurse my bruised body and heal my wounds, and forget the insults and injuries of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8059"/>A few weeks after this I was sent for to perform a parochial duty at <placeName reg="Mars Bluff, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096204">Mars Bluff</placeName>, some <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles distant</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8060"/>They were excited to the highest pitch of rage, and thirsted for revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8061"/>They believed that among the prisoners that had just arrived on the railroad-car, on their way to <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, were the very men who committed such horrible outrages in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8062"/>Many of their houses had been laid in ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8063"/>They had been robbed of every means of support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8064"/>Their horses had .been seized; their cattle and hogs bayoneted; their mothers and sisters had been insulted, and robbed of their watches, ear and <rs n="wedding rings" type="product">wedding rings</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8065"/>Some of their parents had been murdered in cold blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8066"/>The aged pastor, to whose voice they had so often listened, had been kicked and knocked down by repeated blows; and his hoary head had been dragged about in the sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8067"/>They entreated me to examine the prisoners and see whether I could identify the men that had inflicted such barbarities on me. I told them I would do so, provided they would remain where they were and not follow me. The prisoners saw me at a distance, held down their guilty heads, and trembled like aspen-leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8097"/>when the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers laid down their arms and went home, all hostilities against the power of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8098"/>The powers delegated in the compact of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> by these states, <hi rend="italics">i.e</hi>., by the people thereof, to a central organization to promote their general welfare, had been used for their devastation and subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8099"/>It was conceded, as the result of the contest, that the <orgName n="U. S.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8100"/>Nothing remained to be done but for the sovereigns, the people of each state, to assert their authority and restore order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8101"/>If the principle of the sovereignty of the people, the corner stone of all institutions, had survived and was still in force, it was necessary only that the people of each state should reconsider their ordinances of secession, and again recognize the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> as the <pb id="p.608" n="608"/> supreme law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8102"/>This simple process would have placed the <rs>Union</rs> on its original basis, and have restored that which had ceased to exist, the <rs>Union</rs> by consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8103"/>Unfortunately, such was not the intention of the conqueror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8104"/>The Union of free wills and brotherly hearts, under a compact ordained by the people, was not his object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8105"/>Henceforth there was to be established a Union of force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8106"/>Sovereignty was to pass from the people to the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and to be upheld by those who had furnished the money and the soldiers for the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8107"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step required, therefore, in the process for the reconstruction of the new and forced Union, was to prepare those who had been the late champions of the sovereignty of the people to become suitable subjects under the new sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8108"/>As they stood defenseless, stripped of their property, and exposed, as it was asserted, to the penalties of insurrection on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and that of treason on the other, the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0129.0041.00608.05229" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, who, as VicePresi-dent, became <rs type="role2">President</rs> after the death of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0129.0041.00608.05230" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:10"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, on <dateStruct value="1865-05-29"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="29">29</day>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, thus addressed them: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8109"/>To the end, therefore, that the authority of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> may be restored, and that peace, order, and freedom may be reestablished, I, <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0129.0041.00608.05231" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, do proclaim and declare that I hereby grant to all persons who have directly or indirectly participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, amnesty and pardon, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves, and except in cases where legal proceedings under the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> providing for the confiscation of property of persons engaged in the rebellion have been instituted; but on the condition, nevertheless, that every such person shall take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation, and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate; and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation, and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to wit:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8110"/><q direct="unspecified">I,&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, do solemnly swear, or affirm, in presence of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that I will henceforth faithfully support and defend the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> thereunder, and that I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclamations which have been made during the existing rebellion with reference to the emancipation of slaves, so help me <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</q></p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8111"/>The permission to take this oath was withheld from large classes of citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8112"/>It will be seen that there are <num value="2">two</num> stipulations in this oath, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> faithfully to support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> thereunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8113"/>This comprises obedience to the laws made in conformity to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and is all that is requisite in the simple oath of allegiance of an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8114"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> stipulation is: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8115"/>To abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclamations which have been <pb id="p.609" n="609"/> made during the existing rebellion with reference to the emancipation of slaves.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8116"/>What need was there of this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> stipulation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8117"/>Because the laws were not enacted, nor the proclamation issued under any grant of power in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or under its authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8118"/>Now, the exercise of a power by government, for which it has no constitutional authority, is not only a usurpation, but it destroys the sanction of all written instruments of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8119"/>Also, what has become of the unalienable right of property, which all the state governments were created to protect and preserve?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8120"/>Where was the sovereignty of the people under these proceedings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8121"/>Yet the <rs>Confederate</rs> citizen was required to bind himself by an oath to abide by and faithfully support all these usurpations, the alternative being to resist the government, or to aid and abet a violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8122"/>Meanwhile, each of the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was occupied by a military force of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and military orders were the supreme law; that government thereby proceeded to establish a state organization based on the principle of its own sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8123"/>In the first place, the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> issued a proclamation in such terms as to be applicable to each of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> wherever its affairs were in such process of subjugation as to permit the commencement of the proposed organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8124"/>This proclamation begins by setting forth <num value="4">four</num> propositions as the basis of his authority; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the <rs>Constitution</rs> declares that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> shall guarantee to every state in the <rs>Union</rs> a republican form of government, and protect each against invasion and domestic violence; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the <rs>President</rs> is commander-in-chief of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy, as well as chief civil executive officer, and bound to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, the rebellion, in its revolutionary progress, deprived the people of all civil government; <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, it becomes necessary and proper to enforce and carry out the obligations of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to the people of the state in securing it in the enjoyment of a republican form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8125"/>Therefore . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8126"/>These propositions call for a notice as well because of their fallacy as their enormity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8127"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> declares that the so-called rebellion, in its progress, deprived the people of each Confederate state of all civil government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8128"/>There was a government over each Confederate state, then existing and in full operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8129"/>It was, in all its internal relations, the same government which existed when the state was a member of the <rs>Union</rs>, whereby it was recognized by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and by the other states as a lawful and republican state <pb id="p.610" n="610"/> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8130"/>It had been created by the free consent of the people of the state, and they had defended it with their lives and their fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8131"/>It had been denied by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that any <num value="1">one</num> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was a foreign state or outside the <rs>Union</rs> by its secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8132"/>There was, therefore, neither in law nor in fact, any foundation for the assertion that the so-called rebellion had deprived the people of each Confederate state of all civil government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8133"/>Having thus stripped each Confederate state of all civil government, it was asserted that the <rs>Constitution</rs> declares that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> shall guarantee to each state a republican form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8134"/>But to guarantee is not to create, to organize, or to bring into existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8135"/>This can be done for a state government only by the free and unconstrained action of its whole people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8136"/>The creation of such a government is beyond the powers of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as has already been shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8137"/>After a republican government has been instituted by the people, the <rs>Constitution</rs> requires the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to guarantee its existence, and thereby forbids them or their government to overthrow it and set up a creature of its own. The duty to guarantee commands the preservation of that which already exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8138"/>Such were the governments of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate states</placeName> before the war and after the war. Thus the power granted in the <rs>Constitution</rs> to preserve and guarantee state governments was perverted to overthrow and destroy republican governments, and to erect in their places military governors, legislatures, and judicial tribunals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8139"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> proposition is that the <rs>President</rs> is commander-in-chief of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy and the chief civil executive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8140"/>His troops already occupied each of these states, and held the people in subjection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8141"/>His proclamation was therefore merely a military order from the hand of the conqueror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8142"/>Everything which he can do under such a character partakes of the nature, simply and solely, of martial law. Therefore he proceeds under the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> proposition, wherein it <q direct="unspecified">becomes necessary and proper to carry out the obligations of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to the people</q> of each Confederate state, <q direct="unspecified">in securing them in the enjoyment of a republican form of government.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8143"/>The American people were now about to witness, on an extensive scale, the tyrannical experiment of instituting republican governments by the processes of martial law. They had declared it to be a self-evident truth that it was <q direct="unspecified">the right of the people to alter or to abolish it [their government], and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to <pb id="p.611" n="611"/> effect their safety and happiness.</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8144"/><hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi>.</note> This principle of the sovereignty of the people was now rejected, and the sovereignty of fleets and armies was substituted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8145"/><q direct="unspecified">Now, therefore,</q> says the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy, and the chief civil executive officer of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <q direct="unspecified">in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed upon me by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and for the purpose of enabling the loyal people of said state (or states) to organize a State government, whereby justice may be established, domestic tranquillity restored, and loyal citizens protected in all their rights of life, liberty, and property, I do hereby appoint &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; <rs type="role" reg="provisional-Governor">provisional governor</rs> of the state.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8146"/>It will be here noticed that all the proceedings are undertaken for the sake of the <q direct="unspecified">loyal</q> persons in the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8147"/>Who is to decide what persons are <q direct="unspecified">loyal</q>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8148"/>He who issues the military order&mdash;the <rs>President</rs> and his agent the <rs type="role" reg="provisional-Governor">provisional governor</rs>; they naturally will decide those to be loyal who support and obey their orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8149"/>The free assent and dissent which are the basis of the validity of every political action under our system, are unknown in this case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8150"/>The duty of the <rs type="role" reg="provisional-Governor">provisional governor</rs> is declared in the proclamation to be <q direct="unspecified">to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for convening a convention composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the people of the state who are <quote>loyal</quote> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and no others, for the purpose of altering and amending the <rs>Constitution</rs> thereof.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8151"/>In the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> propositions laid down as the basis of authority for the <rs>President</rs>'s proceedings, above mentioned, it is declared that the so-called rebellion <q direct="unspecified">deprived the people of the state of all civil government</q>; but here it is made the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty of the <rs type="role" reg="provisional-Governor">provisional governor</rs> to procure a convention of <q direct="unspecified">loyal</q> persons <q direct="unspecified">to alter and amend the <rs>Constitution</rs></q> of the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8152"/>Thus it seems that there was a state in existence, and a Constitution in full vigor, notwithstanding the above declaration of the <rs>President</rs> to the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8153"/>This was that Constitution of the state which was in force during that long and peaceful period through which the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was observed, and constitutional laws enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8154"/>Now it was to be altered and amended from what the sovereign people of those days had ordained it to be, at the command, and to conform to the views, of another sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8155"/>The nature of those alterations and amendments will be stated hereafter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8156"/>This convention was to possess the authority to exercise all the <pb id="p.612" n="612"/> powers necessary <q direct="unspecified">to restore the <rs>State</rs> to its constitutional relations with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8157"/>It was further provided that no person should vote unless he had taken the amnesty oath mentioned on a previous page, and was a qualified voter previous to the secession of the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8158"/>The convention or the subsequent legislature was to prescribe the qualification of all voters afterward&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">a power,</q> says the <rs>President</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">the people of the several States composing the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> have rightfully exercised from the origin of the <rs>Government</rs> to the present time.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8159"/>The proclamation then continued: <q direct="unspecified">And I do hereby direct: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commander</rs> of the department and all officers and persons in the military and naval service aid and assist the said provisional government in carrying into effect this proclamation; and they are enjoined to abstain from in any way hindering, impeding, or discouraging <quote>loyal</quote> people from the organization of a State government as herein authorized.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8160"/>The proclamation closed with instructions to the secretary of each department of the government to proceed to put in operation his department within the limits of the state.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8161"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement for the restoration of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to the <rs>Union</rs> under subjugation was commenced in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 16" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<head>Conclusion</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8673"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object in this work was to prove, by historical authority, that each of the states, as sovereign parties to the compact of Union, had the reserved power to secede from it whenever it should be found not to answer the ends for which it was established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8674"/>If this has been done, it follows that the war was, on the part of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName>, <num value="1">one</num> of aggression and usurpation, and, on the part of the <rs>South</rs>, was for the defense of an inherent, unalienable right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8675"/>My next purpose was to show, by the gallantry and devotion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, in their unequal struggle, how thorough was their conviction of the justice of their cause; that, by their humanity to the wounded and captives, they proved themselves the worthy descendants of chivalric sires, and fit to be free; and that, in every case, as when our army invaded <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, by their respect for private rights, their morality and observance of the laws of civilized war, they are entitled to the confidence and regard of mankind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8676"/>The want of space has compelled me to omit a notice of many noble deeds, both of heroic men and women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8677"/>The roll of honor, merely, would fill more than the pages allotted to this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8678"/>To others, who can say <hi rend="italics">cuncta quorum vidi</hi>, I must leave the pleasant task of paying the tribute due to their associate patriots.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8679"/>In asserting the right of secession, it has not been my wish to incite to its exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8680"/>I recognize the fact that the war showed it to be impracticable, but this did not prove it to be wrong; now that it may not be again attempted, and that the <rs>Union</rs> may promote the general welfare, it is needful that the truth, the whole truth, should be known, so that crimination and recrimination may for ever cease, and then, on the basis of fraternity and faithful regard for the rights of the states, there may be written on the arch of the <rs>Union</rs>, <hi rend="italics">Esto perpetua</hi>.</p>
