<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>I have formed the design of writing a History of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from the <rs>Discovery</rs> of the <rs>American Continent</rs> to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>As the moment arrives for publishing a portion of the work, I am impressed more strongly than ever with a sense of the grandeur and vastness of the subject; and am ready to charge myself with presumption for venturing on so bold an enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>I can find for myself no excuse but in the sincerity with which I have sought to collect truth from trust-worthy documents and testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>I have desired to give to the work the interest of authenticity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>I have applied, as I have proceeded, the principles of historical skepticism, and, not allowing myself to grow weary in comparing witnesses, or consulting codes of laws, I Have endeavored to impart originality to my narrative, by deriving it from writings and sources which were the contemporaries of the events that are described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Where different nations or different parties have been engaged in the same scenes I have not failed to examine their respective reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Such an investigation on any country <pb n="vi"/> would be laborious; I need not say how much the labor is increased by the extent of our republic, the differences in the origin and early government of its component parts, and the multiplicity of topics, which require to be discussed and arranged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Much error had become incorporated with American history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Many of the early writers in <placeName>Europe</placeName> were only careful to explain the physical qualities of the country; and the political institutions of dependent colonies were not thought worthy of exact inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The early history was often written with a carelessness which seized on rumors and vague recollections as sufficient authority for an assertion which satisfied prejudice by wanton perversions, and which, where materials were not at hand, substituted the inferences of the writer for authenticated facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>These early books have ever since been cited as authorities, and the errors, sometimes repeated even by considerate writers, whose distrust was not excited, have almost acquired a prescriptive right to a place in the annals of <placeName>America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This state of things has increased the difficulty of my undertaking, and, I believe, also, its utility; and I cannot regret the labor which has enabled me to present, under a somewhat new aspect, the early love of liberty in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>; the causes and nature of its loyalty; its commercial freedom; the colonial policy of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0326.0002.00000.00001" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,Richard,,,:2"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>; the independent spirit of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>; the early institutions of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>; and the stern independence of the <pb n="vii"/> <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Puritans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>On these and other points, on which I have differed from received accounts, I appeal with confidence to the judgment of those who are critically acquainted with the sources of our early history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I have dwelt at considerable length on this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> period, because it contains the germ of our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The maturity of the nation is but a continuation of its youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The spirit of the colonies demanded freedom from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It was in this period, that <placeName>Virginia</placeName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> asserted the doctrine of popular sovereignty; that the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> constituted their own government; that New Plymouth, Connecticut, New Haven, New Hampshire, <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, rested their legislation on the popular will; that <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> declared itself a perfect commonwealth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the progress of the work, I have been most liberally aided by the directors of our chief public libraries; especially the library at <placeName>Cambridge</placeName>, on American history the richest in the world, has been opened to me as freely as if it had been my own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The arrangement of the materials has been not the least difficult part of my labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A few topics have been anticipated; a few, reserved for an opportunity where they can be more successfully grouped with other incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>To give unity to the account of New Belgium, I reserve the subject for the next volume.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>For the work which I have undertaken will necessarily extend to several volumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I aim at being concise; but also at giving a full picture or <pb n="viii"/> the progress of American institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume is now published separately; and for a double motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The work has already occasioned long preparation, and its completion will require further years of exertion; I have been unwilling to travel so long a journey alone; and desire, as I proceed, to correct my own judgment by the criticisms of candor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I have thought that the public would recognize the sincerity of my inquiries, and that, in those states where the materials of history have as yet been less carefully collected, and less critically compared, I should make for myself friends disposed to assist in placing within my reach the sources of information which are essential to success. </p><closer><dateline><dateStruct value="1834-06-16"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="16">16</day>, <year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct>.</dateline> </closer></div1>

<head>Introduction.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName> constitute an essential portion of a great political system, embracing all the civilized nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>At a period when the force of moral opinion is rapidly increasing, they have the precedence in the practice and the defence of the equal rights of man. The sovereignty of the people is here a conceded axiom, and the laws, established upon that basis, are cherished with faithful patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>While the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> aspire after change, our constitution engages the fond admiration of the people, by which it has been established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Prosperity follows the execution of even justice; invention is quickened by the freedom of competition; and labor rewarded with sure and unexampled returns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Domestic peace is maintained without the aid of a military establishment; public sentiment permits the existence of but few standing troops, and those only along the seaboard and <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> on the frontiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>A gallant navy protects our commerce, which spreads its banners on every sea, and extends its enterprise to every clime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Our diplomatic relations connect us on terms of equality and honest friendship with the chief powers of the world; while we avoid entangling participation in their intrigues, their passions, and their wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Our national resources are developed by an earnest culture of the arts of peace Every man may enjoy the fruits of his industry; every mind is free to publish its convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Our government, by its organization, is necessarily identified with the interests of the people, and relies exclusively on then attachment for its durability and support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Even the enemies of the state, if there are any among us, have liberty to express their opinions undisturbed; and are safely tolerated, where reason is left free to combat their errors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Nor is the constitution a dead letter, unalterably fixed; it has the capacity for improvement; adopting whatever changes time and the public will may require, and safe from decay, so long as that will retains its energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>New states are forming in the wilderness; cabals, intersecting our plains and crossing our highlands, open numerous channels to internal commerce; manufactures prosper along our watercourses; the use of steam on our rivers and rail-roads annihilates distance by the acceleration of speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Our wealth and population, already giving us a place in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rank of nations, are so rapidly cumulative, that the former is increased fourfold, and the latter is <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> doubled, in every period of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> or <measure n="23years" type="date">twenty-three years</measure>. There is no national debt; the community is opulent; the government economical; and the public treasury full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Religion, neither persecuted nor paid by the state, is sustained by the regard for public morals and the convictions of an enlightened faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Intelligence is diffused with unparalleled universality; a free press teems with the choicest productions of all nations and ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There are more daily journals in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than in the world beside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>A public document of general interest is, within a month, reproduced in at east a <num value="1000000">million</num> of copies, and is brought within the reach of every freeman in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>An immense concourse of emigrants of the most various lineage is perpetually crowding to our shores; and the principles of liberty, uniting all interests by the operation of equal laws, blend the discordant elements into harmonious union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Other governments are convulsed by the innovations and reforms of neighboring states; our constitution, fixed in the affections of the people, from whose choice it has sprung, neutralizes the influence of foreign principles, and fearlessly opens an asylum to the virtuous, the unfortunate, and the oppressed of every nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>And yet it is but little more than <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure>, since the oldest of our states received its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> permanent colony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Before that time the whole territory was an unproductive waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Throughout its wide extent the arts had not erected a monument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Its only <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> inhabitants were a few scattered tribes of feeble barbarians, destitute of commerce and of political connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The axe and the ploughshare were unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The soil, which had been gathering fertility from the repose of centuries, was lavishing its strength in magnificent but useless vegetation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In the view of civilization the immense domain was a solitude.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is the object of the present work to explain how the change in the condition of our land has been accomplished; and, as the fortunes of a nation are not under the control of blind destiny, to follow the steps by which a favoring <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, calling our institutions into being, has conducted the country to its present happiness and glory. </p></div1>
