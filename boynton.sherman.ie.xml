<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0128.0001.00007.00001" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:38"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most popular heroes of the late war. He has published his book after <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of reflection upon events in which he bore most conspicuous and honorable part; During these years he has had uninterrupted access to the official records, including their most confidential papers; and in view of his high position, his opportunities for intimate knowledge and his popularity, what he has now written will, in spite of himself, be accepted as history by most readers who have not the means of testing his story by the records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>It is believed that the extracts from these, presented in this volume, will prove sufficient to thoroughly fortify <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0128.0001.00007.00002" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:38"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in the claim that his book is not history, and so in part prevent the injustice which will be done to many distinguished officers and brave armies, if what he has written be received as accurate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>No criticisms of the strategy or the tactics of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0128.0001.00007.00003" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:38"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> will be found in these pages, except such as are plainly called forth by the records produced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>High as is the position which he occupies, great as is the authority with which he speaks, there is nothing in either which should afford him the least protection in the eyes of his countrymen, if he be found detracting from the merit or the fame which belongs to his associates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It might be pardoned in <num value="1">one</num> who accomplished so much if he had contented himself with moderately magnifying his own achievements, but when he goes beyond this, and claims the <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> merit which belongs to others, and steps still beyond and attempts to belittle the deeds of men in no respect his inferiors' as generals or soldiers, and does cruel injustice to whole armies, the harmless vanity of the successful general becomes the gigantic wrong of the false historian.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In a broad and high sense, the merit of every man who bore a musket faithfully, and slept finally in the grave of the <q direct="unspecified">unknown,</q> is as great as his. His Memoirs arraign the dead as well as the living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The files of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> afford an answer for both; These orders, letters, telegrams, and reports, written either before, at the time, or immediately after the occurrence of the events ordered, in progress, or accomplished, photographed the truth, and in these the living and the dead find just defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Here <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0128.0001.00008.00004" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,George,H.,,:38"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, <persName n="McPherson,,,,," id="n0128.0001.00008.00005" reg="mostcommon:McPherson,nomatch:0"><surname>McPherson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0128.0001.00008.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,:11"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, and their companions, speak for themselves, and vindicate themselves from unjust aspersions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Here, in short, truth is made manifest, and exact justice done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The position which <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0128.0001.00008.00007" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:38"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> occupies now, and that which he held during the war, will naturally, and of necessity, give the force of history to what he has written, in spite of any disclaimer he may make, and this historical character will attach to these Memoirs so long as they remain uncorrected by the official record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>For the benefit of comrades living, who can not conveniently consult these records, and especially in vindication of such as are dead, it should be esteemed a duty by all who can reach the files, to search them carefully, with a view to overthrow error and establish truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>So far as <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0128.0001.00008.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:38"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s book conforms to official papers, their production can only strengthen him; so far as it fails to agree with these, it not only deserves to be condemned, but its condemnation should be measured by the prominence of the author and his abundant facilities for obtaining accurate information.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Judged by the official record, the verdict must be that the work is intensely egotistical, unreliable, and cruelly unjust to nearly all his distinguished associates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Our erratic General <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> thrusts his pen recklessly through reputations which are as dear to the country as his own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The salient points of the long story are readily found by those who either followed, or made themselves familiar by study with his campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The reader turns naturally for explanations of the surprise and attending disgrace at <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>; the ill-judged and fatal assault at <placeName reg="Chickasaw Bayou, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,2236232">Chickasaw Bayou</placeName>; the protest against the move by which <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was captured; his failure to carry the point assigned him at the <rs n="Battle of Chattanooga" type="battle">battle of Chattanooga</rs>; the escape of <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0128.0001.00009.00020" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:10"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2024046" n="1.000 167" reg="resaca, gordon, georgia">Resaca</placeName>; the terrible mistake of the assault on <placeName key="tgn,2062292" n="1.000 10" reg="Kenesaw, Adams, Nebraska">Kenesaw</placeName>; the plunging of his army, marching by the flank, into <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0128.0001.00009.00021" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s line of battle under the supposition that <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> was evacuated; the escape of the rebel army from <placeName key="tgn,7014487" n="1.000 9" reg="savannah, chatham, georgia">Savannah</placeName>; the careless and inexcusable periling and narrow escape of his own army at <placeName reg="Bentonville, Johnston, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014705">Bentonville</placeName>; and lastly, the political surrender to <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0128.0001.00009.00022" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:10"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName>: these are points upon which every reader desires light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But instead of gaining it, he finds that for most, the chief aim of the author seems to be to make the darkness more impenetrable.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> 
<text><body> 
<p>I have received no information in respect to the general plan of campaign, and therefore feel much hesitation in recommending any line of operations for these and other troops which I may be able to withdraw from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Of course this line must be subordinate to some general plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I take it for granted General, that what has heretofore been done has been the result of political policy rather than military strategy, and that the want of success on our part is attributable to the politicians rather than to the generals. * *</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I am aware General, that you are in no way responsible for this; these movements have been governed by political expediency, and in many cases directed by politicians in order to subserve party interest. * * * But is it not possible, with the new <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, to introduce a different policy, and make our future movements in accordance with <hi rend="italics">military principles</hi>. On this supposition I venture to make a few suggestions in regard to operations in the <rs>West</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The idea of moving down the <rs>Mississippi</rs> by steam, is in my opinion impracticable, or at least premature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It is not the proper line of operations, at least now. A much more feasible plan is to move up the <rs>Cumberland</rs> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, making <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 18" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> the present objective point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This would threaten <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, and force the abandonment of <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName>. * * * *</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>This line of the <rs>Cumberland</rs> and the <rs>Tennessee</rs> is the great central line of the <rs>Western</rs> theater of war, with the <rs>Ohio</rs> below the mouth of <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green River</placeName> as the base, and <num value="2">two</num> great navigable rivers extending far into the theater of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>But the plan should not be attempted without a large force&mdash;not less than <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> effective men. * * * The main central line will also require the withdrawal of all available troops from this State, also those in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, which are armed, or still to be armed, and also the transfer to that route, or near it, of all the <rs>Kentucky</rs> troops not required to secure the line of <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green River</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The force at <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> and on the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName> below the mouth of <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green River</placeName> is now about <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num>. <num value="7">Seven</num> regiments have just been ordered there from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>By the middle or last of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> I hope to send <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>If <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> or <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> can be added from the sources indicated, these will be sufficient for holding <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2041950" n="1.000 19" reg="wickliffe, ballard, kentucky">Fort Holt</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,2040656" n="1.000 206" reg="paducah, mccracken, kentucky">Paducah</placeName>, and form the column proposed. * * *</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>These suggestions are hastily written out, but they are the result of much anxious inquiry and mature deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I am confident that the plan, if properly carried out, will produce important results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I also believe it to be feasible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I have not designated any particular line or lines of movement; that must <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> be a matter for further study, if the general idea should be approved.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>General: I received your dispatch, and, with more delay than I meant, proceed to the subject of it, in compliance with your request, and I may add also, at the wish of the <rs>President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>I do not underrate the difficulties in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, but I think it is not extravagant to say that the great power of the rebellion in the <rs>West</rs> is arranged on a front, the flanks of which are <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName>, and the center about where the railroad between those points crosses the <placeName reg="Tennessee River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2715022">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Poor Fork Cumberland River, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,2592540">Cumberland Rivers</placeName>, including <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 18" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> and the fortified points below, It is, I have no doubt, within bounds to estimate their force on that line at <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> men, including a column about <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset, Ky.</placeName> In rear of their right flank it is more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Of their force, <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> may be set down as at <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName>, <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> at <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>&mdash;though you, doubtless, have more information on that point than I have&mdash;and <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> at the center.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Considering the railroad facilities, which enable the enemy to concentrate in a few hours on any single point of this front, you will at once see the importance of a combined attack on its center and flanks, or at least of demonstrations which may be converted into real attacks, and fully occupy the enemy on the whole front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It is probable that you may have given the subject, as far as <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> and the center are concerned, more attention than I have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>With reference to the former, at least, I can make no more than the general suggestion already expressed, that it should be fully occupied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The attack upon the center should be made by <num value="2">two</num> gun-boat expeditions, with, I should say, <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men on the <num value="2">two</num> rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>They should, of course, be organized with reference to the depth of water in the rivers; and whether they should be of equal or unequal strength, would depend upon that and other considerations, and can hardly be determined until the moment of departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The mode of attack must depend on the strength of the enemy at the several points and the features of the localities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>It will be of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance to break the railroad communication, and, if possible, that should be done by columns moving rapidly to the bridges over the <rs>Cumberland</rs> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The former probably would not be reached at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, being some <measure n="31miles" type="distance">thirty-one miles</measure> above the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> principal battery that I know of at <placeName reg="Dover, Strafford, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013613">Dover</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The other is <placeName><distance reg="18miles">eighteen miles</distance> above <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Fort Henry</placeName></placeName>&mdash;the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I know of on the <rs>Tennessee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>If the expeditions should not be strong enough to do the work alone, they should establish themselves firmly at the nearest possible point, and remain at least until they ascertained that reenforcements from my columns, or some other source, would not reach them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>By uniting, they could establish themselves permanently under the protection of the gun-boats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>I say this much rather to lay the subject before you than to propose any definite plan for your side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Whatever is done should be done speedily, within <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> a few days.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>My last advices from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> represent that the enemy has about <num value="22000">twenty-two thousand</num> men there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>I have only about <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> at <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2041950" n="1.000 19" reg="wickliffe, ballard, kentucky">Fort Holt</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,2040656" n="1.000 206" reg="paducah, mccracken, kentucky">Paducah</placeName>, and after leaving guards at these places I could not send into the field over <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="11000">eleven thousand</num>.

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>The army west of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> is unavailable for the arrest of the victorious career of the enemy east of that river, and is inadequate for the defense of the country west of it. The country is worn down by a brilliant and heroic, but exhausting and bloody struggle of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>. Our ports are <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> closed so as to exclude the hope of procuring arms and supplies from abroad; and we are unable to arm our people if they were willing to continue the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>The supplies of quartermaster and commissary stores in the country are very limited in amount, and our railroads are so broken and destroyed as to prevent, to a great extent, the transportation and accumulation of those remaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>Our currency has lost its purchasing power, and there is no other means of supplying the treasury; and the people are hostile to impressments and endeavor to conceal such supplies as are needed for the army from the officers charged with their collection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>Our armies, in case of a prolongation of the struggle, will continue to melt away as they retreat through the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>There is danger, and I think I might say certainty, based on the information we have, that a portion, and probably all of the <name>States</name> will make separate terms with the enemy as they are overrun, with the chance that the terms so obtained will be less favorable to them than those contained in the agreement under consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>And the despair of our people will prevent a much longer continuance of serious resistance, unless they shall be hereafter urged to it by unendurable oppressions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>The agreement under consideration secures to our people, if ratified by both parties, the uninterrupted continuance of the existing State Governments; the guarantees of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, and of the <name>Constitutions</name> of their respective States; the guarantee of their political rights and of their rights of person and property, and immunity from future prosecutions and penalties for their participation in the existing war, on the condition that we accept the <rs>Constitution</rs> and Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and disband our armies by marching the troops to their respective States, and depositing their arms in the <rs>State</rs> arsenals, subject to the future control of that Government, but with a verbal understanding that they are only to be used for the preservation of peace and order in the, respective States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>It is also to be observed that the agreement contains no direct reference to the question of slavery, requires no concessions from us in regard to it, and leaves it subject to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and Laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and of the several States just as it was before the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>With these facts before us, and under the belief that we can not now reasonably hope for the achievement of our independence, which should be dearer than life if it were possibly attainable, and under the belief that a continuance of the struggle, with its sacrifices of life and property, and its accumulation of sufferings, without a reasonable prospect of success, would be both unwise and criminal, I advise that you assent to the agreement as the best you can now do for the people who have clothed you with the high trust of your position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>In advising this course I do not conceal from myself, nor would I withhold from your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, the danger of trusting the people who drove us to war by their unconstitutional and unjust aggressions, and who will now add the consciousness of power to their love of dominion and greed of gain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>It is right also for me to say that much as we have been exhausted in men <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> and resources, I am of opinion that if our people could be induced to continue the contest with the spirit which animated them during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> years of the war, our independence might yet be within our reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>But I see no reason to hope for that now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>On the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">second</day></dateStruct> question, as to the proper mode of executing the agreement, I have to say that whatever you may do looking to the termination of the contest by an amicable arrangement which may embrace the extinction of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, must be done without special authority to be found in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>And yet, I am of opinion that, charged as you are with the duty of looking to the general welfare of the people, and without time or opportunity, under the peculiarity and necessities of the case, to submit the whole question to the <name>States</name> for their deliberation and action without danger of losing material advantages provided for in the agreement; and, as I believe that you, representing the military power and authority of all the <name>States</name>, can obtain better terms for them than it is probable they could obtain each for itself; and, as it is in your power, if the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities accept this agreement, to terminate the ravages of war sooner than it can be done by the several States, while the enemy is still unconscious of the full extent of our weakness, you should, in case of the acceptance of the terms of this agreement by the authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, accept them on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and take steps for the disbanding of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> on the terms agreed on. As you have no power to change the government of the country, or to transfer the allegiance of the people, I would advise that you submit to the several States, through their governors, the question as to whether they will, in the exercise of their own sovereignty, accept, each for itself, the terms proposed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>To this it may be said, that after the disbanding of our armies and the abandonment of the contest by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, they would have no alternative but to accept the terms proposed or an unequal and hopeless war, and that it would be needless for them to go through the forms and incur the trouble and expense of assembling a convention for the purpose To such an objection, if urged, it may be answered that we entered into the contest to maintain and vindicate the doctrine of State rights and State sovereignty, and the right of self government, and that we can only be faithful to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and true to the principles in support of which we have expended so much blood and treasure, by the employment of the same agencies to return into the old Union which we employed in separating from it and in forming our present Government; and that if this should be an unwelcome and enforced action by the <name>States</name>, it would not be more so on the part of the <name>States</name> than on the part of the <rs>President</rs>, if he were to undertake to execute the whole agreement, and while they would have authority for acting lie would have none.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>This plan would at least conform to the theory of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and would, in future, be an additional precedent, to which the friends of State rights could point in opposing the doctrine of the <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> consolidation of powers in the central government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>And if the future shall disclose a disposition (of which I fear the chance is remote) on the part of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to return to the spirit and meaning of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, then this action on the part of the <name>States</name> might prove to be of great value to the friends of constitutional liberty and good government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>In addition to the terms of agreement, an additional provision should be asked for, which will probably be allowed without objection, stipulating for the withdrawal of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces from the several States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, except a sufficient number to garrison the permanent fortifications and take care of the public property until the <name>States</name> can call their conventions and take action on the proposed terms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>In addition to the necessity for this course, in order to make their action as free and voluntary as other circumstances will allow, it would aid in softening the bitter memories which must necessarily follow such a contest as that in which we are engaged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>Nothing is said in the agreement about the public debt and the disposition of our public property beyond the turning over of the arms to the <rs>State</rs> arsenals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>In the final adjustment we should endeavor to secure provisions for the auditing of the debt of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and for its payment in common with the war debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>We may ask this on the ground that we did not seek this war, but only sought peaceful separation to secure our people and States from the effects of unconstitutional encroachments by the other States, and because, on the principles of equity, allowing that both parties had acted in good faith, and gone to war on a misunderstanding which admitted of no other solution, and now agree to a reconciliation, and to a burial of the past, it would be unjust to compel our people to assist in the payment of the war debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and for them to refuse to allow such of the revenues as we might contribute to be applied to the payment of our creditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>If it should be said that this is a liberality never extended by the conqueror to the conquered, the answer is that if the object of the pacification is to restore the <rs>Union</rs> in good faith and to reconcile the people to each other, to restore confidence and faith, and prosperity, and homogenity, then it is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance that the terms of reconciliation should be based on entire equity, and that no just ground of grief or complaint should be left to either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>And to both parties, looking not only to the present but to the interest of future generations, the amount of money which would be involved, though large, would be as nothing when compared with a reconciliation entirely equitable, which should leave no sting to honor, and no sense of wrong to rankle in the memories of the people, and lay the foundation for new difficulties and for future wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>It is to this feature, it seems to me, the greatest attention should be given by both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>It will be of the highest importance to all, for the present as well as for the future, that the frankness, sincerity, and justice of both parties shall be as conspicuous in the adjustment of past difficulties, as their courage and <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> endurance have been during the war, if we would make peace on a basis which would be satisfactory and might be rendered perpetual</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>The Confederacy is, in a word, unable to continue the war by armies in the field, and the struggle can no longer be maintained in any other manner than by a guerrilla or partisan warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>Such a warfare is not, in my opinion, desirable, nor does it promise any-useful result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>It would entail far more suffering on our own people than it would cause damage to the enemy; and <pb id="p.252" n="252"/> the people have been such heavy sufferers by the calamities of the war for the last <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> that it is at least questionable whether they would be willing to engage in such a contest, unless forced to endure its horrors in preference to dishonor and degradation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>The terms of the convention imply no dishonor, impose no degradation, exact only what the victor always requires&mdash;the relinquishment by his foe of the object for which the struggle was commenced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>Seeing no reasonable hope of our ability to conquer our independence, admitting the undeniable fact that we have been vanquished in the war, it is my opinion that these terms should be accepted, being as favorable as any that we, as the defeated belligerents, have reason to expect or can hope to secure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>It is further my opinion that the <rs>President</rs> owes it to the <name>States</name> and to the people to obtain for them, by a general pacification, rights and advantages which they would, in all probability, be unable to secure by the separate action of the different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>It is natural that the enemy should be willing to accord more liberal conditions for the purpose of closing the war at once than would be granted if each State should continue the contest till separate terms could be made for itself.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>The States alone can act in dissolving the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and returning to the <rs>Union</rs>, according to the terms of the convention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>I think that if this convention be ratified by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the <rs>President</rs> should, by proclamation, inform the <name>States</name> and the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of the facts above recited; should ratify the convention so far as he has authority to act as <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, and should execute the military provisions; should declare his inability, with the means remaining at his disposal, to defend the <rs>Confederacy</rs> or maintain its independence, and should resign a trust which it is no longer possible to fulfill.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3237"/>These propositions, agreed upon and signed by <persName n="Johnston,General,Joseph,E.,," id="n0128.0018.00253.03634" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,,W.,T.,," id="n0128.0018.00253.03635" reg="expanded:Sherman,William,T.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, may fairly be regarded as providing for the immediate cessation of hostilities, the disbandment of our armies, and the return of our soldiers to the peaceful walks of life; the restoration of the several States of our Confederacy to the old Union, with the integrity of their State Governments preserved; the security of their <q direct="unspecified">people and inhabitants</q> in their rights of person and property under the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <name>Laws</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, equally with the people of any other State, guaranteed, and a general amnesty for and on account of any participation in the present war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>The very grave responsibility devolved upon you by these propositions is at once apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>To enter at all upon their discussion is to admit that independence, the great object of our struggle, is hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>I believe and admit this to be the case, and therefore do I advise you to accept these propositions so far as you have the power to do so; and my conviction is that <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of the people of every State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> would so advise if opportunity were presented them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>They are weary of the war and desire peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>If they could be rallied and brought to the field, a united and determined people might even yet achieve independence; but many circumstances admonish us that we can not count upon their cordial and united action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>The vast army of deserters and absentees from our military service during the past <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, the unwillingness of the people to enter the armies, the impracticability of recruiting them, the present utter demoralization of our troops consequent upon the destruction of the <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">Army of Virginia</orgName>, the rapid decrease by desertion of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0128.0018.00253.03636" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, which as it retreats south, if retreat it can, will retain in its ranks but few soldiers beyond the by-paths and cross-roads which lead to their homes, together with the recent successes of the enemy, the fall of <placeName reg="Selma, Dallas, Alabama" key="tgn,2005248">Selma</placeName>, <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0128.0018.00253.03637" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>, his forces in the field and his vast resources, all dictate the admission I have made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>I do not believe that by any possibility we could organize, arm, and equip, and bring into the field this side of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men within the next <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, and I am convinced that both <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0128.0018.00253.03638" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0128.0018.00253.03639" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> are utterly hopeless of continuing the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>A guerrilla warfare might be carried on in certain portions of our country for a time, perhaps for years, but while such a warfare would be more disastrous to our own people than it could possibly be to the enemy, it would exercise little or no influence upon his military operations, or upon his hold upon the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>Conducted upon our own soil our own people would chiefly feel its evils, and would afford it neither countenance nor support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>Guerrilla warfare never has been and never can be carried on by and between peoples of a common origin, language, and institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/><pb id="p.254" n="254"/></p> 
<p>Our sea-board and our ports being in the enemy's hands we can not rely upon supplies of arms and other munitions of war from abroad, and our means of producing them at home, already limited, are daily decreasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>The loss of <placeName reg="Selma, Dallas, Alabama" key="tgn,2005248">Selma</placeName> and of <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, where much valuable machinery for the construction of ordnance and ordnance stores was collected, must materially circumscribe our ability in this respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>Our currency is nearly worthless, and will become utterly so with further military disasters, and there is no hope that we can improve it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>The arms of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have rendered the great object of our struggle hopeless, have conquered a reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, and it becomes your duty to secure to the people, as far as practicable, life, liberty, and property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>The propositions signed by the opposing generals are more favorable to these great objects than could justly have been anticipated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>Upon you, with a more thorough knowledge of the condition of our country, the character and sentiments of our people, and of our means and resources, than is possessed by others, is devolved the responsibility of promptly accepting or of promptly rejecting them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>I advise their acceptance; and that, having notified <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0128.0018.00254.03640" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> of your having done so, you promptly issue, so soon as you shall learn the acceptance thereof by the authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, a proclamation to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, setting forth clearly the condition of the country, your inability to resist the enemy's overwhelming numbers, or to protect the country from his devastating and desolating march, the propositions submitted to you, and the reasons which, in your judgment, render their acceptance by the <name>States</name> and the people wise and expedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>The occasion, the emergency, the dire necessities and misfortunes of the country, the vast interests at stake, were never contemplated by those who framed the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>They are all outside of it, and in the dissolution of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and the wreck of all their hopes, the <name>States</name> and the people will turn to you, whose antecedents and whose present position and powers constitute you, more than any other living man, the guardian of their honor and their interests, and will expect you not to stand upon constitutional limitations, but to assume and exercise all powers which to you may seem necessary and proper to shield them from useless war, and to save from the wreck of the country all that may be practicable of honor, life, and property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>If time were allowed for the observance of constitutional forms I would advise the submission of these propositions to the executives of the several States to the end that, through the usual legislative and conventional action, the wills of the people of the <name>States</name> respectively might be known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>But in <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> the present condition of the country such delay as this course would involve would be the death-blow to all hopes founded upon them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>Sir: The questions submitted by you to the members of your Cabinet for their opinions are:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/><num value="1">1</num>. Whether the convention agreed upon on the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th inst.</day></dateStruct>, by and between <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0128.0018.00255.03644" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, commanding the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName>, and <persName n="Sherman,Major-General,,,," id="n0128.0018.00255.03645" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, commanding the forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, should be ratified by you.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/><num value="2">2</num>. If so, in what way should it be done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>The terms of that convention are substantially as follows:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/>That the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> shall be disbanded and their arms surrendered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/>That the several State Governments shall be recognized by the <rs>Executive</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, upon their officers and legislatures taking the oaths prescribed by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>; and where there are conflicting State Governments the question to be referred to the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>That all political rights and franchises, and all rights of person and property, shall be respected and guaranteed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3277"/>That a general amnesty be granted, and no citizen be molested in person or property for any acts done in aid of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in the prosecution of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>Taken as a whole the convention amounts to this, that the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> shall renter the old Union upon the same footing on which they stood before seceding from it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>These States having, in their several conventions, solemnly asserted their sovereignty and right of self-government, and having established for themselves, and maintained through <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of bloody war a government of their own choosing, no loyal citizen can consent to its abandonment and <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> destruction as long as there remains a reasonable hope of successful resistance to the arms of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>The question, therefore, whether the terms of the <orgName n="Military Convention" type="convention">military convention</orgName> should be accepted will depend upon whether the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are in a condition further to prosecute the war with a reasonable hope of success, and this question will be answered by a brief review of our military situation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>The <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> the pride and boast of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, under the lead of the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs>, whose name we have been accustomed to associate with victory, after having been defeated and reduced to a mere remnant by straggling and desertion, has capitulated to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>All who were not embraced in the capitulation have thrown away their arms and disbanded beyond any hope of reorganization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>Our only other army east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, contains now about <num value="13000">thirteen thousand</num> effective men, of infantry and artillery, and is daily melting away by desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>It is confronted by <num value="1">one</num> of the best armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>Manifestly it can not fight, and if it retreats, the chances are more than equal that, like the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, it will dissolve, and the remnant be forced to capitulate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>If it should retreat successfully, and offer itself as a nucleus for reorganization, it can not be recruited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>Volunteering is long since at an end, and conscription has exhausted all its force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>East of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, scattered through all the <name>States</name>, we have now about <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>To oppose these the enemy have more than <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/>Persevering efforts for many months past have failed to overcome the obstacle to the removal of troops from the west to the east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>We can, therefore, look for no accession of strength from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>If a returning sense of duty and patriotism should bring back the stragglers and deserters in sufficient numbers to form a respectable army, we have not the means of arming them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>Our supply of arms is very nearly exhausted, our means of manufacturing substantially at an end, and the blockade of our ports prevents their introduction from abroad, except in small quantities, and at remote points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>In view of these facts our <num value="2">two</num> generals highest in command in the field have expressed in decided terms our inability longer to continue the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/>Observation has satisfied me that the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> are finally lost to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>The people of the latter are utterly weary of the war, broken and despairing in spirit, and eager to accept terms far less liberal than the convention proposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/>In the absence of a general arrangement they will certainly make terms for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>Abandoned by our armies, the people of Virgina will follow their example, and it will be impossible to arrest the process of disintegration thus begun.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>This melancholy array of facts leaves open but <num value="1">one</num> conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>I am unhesitatingly of the opinion that the convention ought to be ratified.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>As to the proper mode of ratification, greater doubt may be reasonably entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> is but the agent of the <name>States</name>, and as its chief executive you can not, according to our governmental theory, bind <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> the <name>States</name> to a government which they have not adopted for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>Nor can you rightfully, without their consent, dissolve the government which they have established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>But there are circumstances so desperate as to over ride all constitutional theories, and such are those which are pressing upon us now. The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is no longer potent for good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>Exhausted by war in all its resources to such a degree that it can no longer offer a respectable show of resistance to its enemies, it is already virtually destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>And the chief duty left for you to peform is to provide as far as possible for the speedy delivery of the people from the horrors of war and anarchy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>I therefore respectfully advise that upon the ratification of the convention by the <rs>Executive</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, you issue your proclamation, plainly setting forth the circumstances which have induced you to assent to the terms proposed, disbanding the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, resigning your office as chief magistrate, and recommending to the people of the <name>States</name> that they assemble in convention and carry into effect the terms agreed on. </p><closer> <signed><persName n="Davis,,George,,," id="n0128.0018.00257.03646" reg="default:Davis,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName>  <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer></body></text></p> </quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>The principal army of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was recently lost in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>Considerable bodies of troops not attached to that army have either disbanded or marched toward their homes, accompanied by many of their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/><measure n="5days" type="date">Five days</measure> ago the effective force, in infantry and artillery, of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0128.0018.00257.03650" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was but <num value="14770">fourteen thousand seven hundred and seventy</num> men, and it continues to diminish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>That officer thinks it wholly impossible for him to make any head against the overwhelming forces of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>Our ports are closed, and the sources of foreign supply lost to us. The enemy occupy all or the greater part of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and move almost at will through the other States to the east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>I do not think it would be possible to assemble, equip, and maintain an army of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men at any point east of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName>. <pb id="p.258" n="258"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>The contest, if continued after this paper is rejected, will be likely to lose entirely the dignity of regular warfare, many of the <name>States</name> will make such terms as they may, in others separate and ineffective hostilities may be prosecuted, while the war, wherever waged, will probably degenerate into that irregular and secondary stage out of which greater evils will flow to the <rs>South</rs> than to the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>For these and for other reasons which need not now be stated, I think we can no longer contend with a reasonable hope of success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>It seems to me that the time has arrived when, in a large and clear view of the situation, prompt steps should be taken to put an end to the war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>This is true, and it was well understood by <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0128.0018.00258.03652" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> that only a part could be executed by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>In any view of the case grave responsibilities must be met and assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>If the necessity for peace be conceded, corresponding action must be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>In his treatment of this question he indulges in many undignified sneers at staff officers.
