<head>Parents.</head> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>My father was a lawyer and a politician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He was a man largely endowed with that sagacious energy, which the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">state of New England</placeName> society, for the last half <pb id="p.1012" n="1012"/> century, has been so well fitted to develop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>His father was a clergyman, settled as pastor in <placeName reg="Princeton, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050443">Princeton, Massachusetts</placeName>, within the bounds of whose parish-farm was Wachuset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>His means were small, and the great object of his ambition was to send his sons to college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>As a boy, my father was taught to think only of preparing himself for <orgName n="Harvard University" type="university">Harvard University</orgName>, and when there of preparing himself for the profession of Law. As a Lawyer, again, the ends constantly presented were to work for distinction in the community, and for the means of supporting a family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>To be an honored citizen, and to have a home on earth, were made the great aims of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>To open the deeper fountains of the soul, to regard life here as the prophetic entrance to immortality, to develop his spirit to perfection,&mdash;motives like these had never been suggested to him, either by fellow-beings or by outward circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The result was a character, in its social aspect, of quite the common sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A good son and brother, a kind neighbor, an active man of business&mdash;in all these outward relations he was but <num value="1">one</num> of a class, which surrounding conditions have made the majority among us. In the more delicate and individual relations, he never approached but <num value="2">two</num> mortals, my mother and myself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>His love for my mother was the green spot on which he stood apart from the common-places of a mere bread-winning, bread-bestowing existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>She was <num value="1">one</num> of those fair and flower-like natures, which sometimes spring up even beside the most dusty highways of life&mdash;a creature not to be shaped into a merely useful instrument, but bound by <num value="1">one</num> law with the blue sky, the dew, and the frolic birds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Of all persons whom I have known, she had in her most of the angelic, <pb id="p.1013" n="1013"/> &mdash;of that spontaneous love for every living thing, for man, and beast, and tree, which restores the golden age.</p></quote></div2> 
<div2 id="c.1.2" type="section" n="c.1.2"> 
<head>Death in the house.</head> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>My earliest recollection is of a death,&mdash;the death of a sister, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> younger than myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Probably there is a sense of childish endearments, such as belong to this tie, mingled with that of loss, of wonder, and mystery; but these last are prominent in memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I remember coming home and meeting our nursery-maid, her face streaming with tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>That strange sight of tears made an indelible impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I realize how little I was of stature, in that I looked up to this weeping face;&mdash;and it has often seemed since, that&mdash;full-grown for the life of this earth, I have looked up just so, at times of threatening, of doubt, and distress, and that just so has some being of the next higher order of existences looked down, aware of a law unknown to me, and tenderly commiserating the pain I must endure in emerging from my ignorance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>She took me by the hand and led me into a still and dark chamber,&mdash;then drew aside the curtain and showed me my sister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I see yet that beauty of death!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The highest achievements of sculpture are only the reminder of its severe sweetness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Then I remember the house all still and dark,&mdash; the people in their black clothes and dreary faces,&mdash;the scent of the newly-made coffin,&mdash; my being set up in a chair and detained by a gentle hand to hear the clergyman,&mdash; the carriages slowly going, the procession slowly doling out their steps to the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But I have no remembrance of what I have since been told I did,&mdash;insisting, with loud cries, that they should <pb id="p.1014" n="1014"/> not put the body in the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I suppose that my emotion was spent at the time, and so there was nothing to fix that moment in my memory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I did not then, nor do I now, find any beauty in these ceremonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>What had they to do with the sweet playful child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Her life and death were alike beautiful, but all this sad parade was not. Thus my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experience of life was <num value="1">one</num> of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>She who would have been the companion of my life was severed from me, and I was left alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This has made a vast difference in my lot. Her character, if that fair face promised right, would have been soft, graceful and lively; it would have tempered mine to a gentler and more gradual course.</p></quote></div2> 
<div2 id="c.1.3" type="section" n="c.1.3"> 
<head>Overwork.</head> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>My father,&mdash;all whose feelings were now concentred on me,&mdash;instructed me himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The effect of this was so far good that, not passing through the hands of many ignorant and weak persons as so many do at preparatory schools, I was put at once under discipline of considerable severity, and, at the same time, had a more than ordinarily high standard presented to me. My father was a man of business, even in literature; he had been a high scholar at college, and was warmly attached to all he had learned there, both from the pleasure he had derived in the exercise of his faculties and the associated memories of success and good repute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He was, beside, well read in <name>French</name> literature, and in <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01014.00010" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, <persName><roleName n="Queen">a Queen</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName></persName>'s man. He hoped to make me the heir of all he knew, and of as much more as the income of his profession enabled him to give me means of acquiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>At the very beginning, he made <num value="1">one</num> great mistake, <pb id="p.1015" n="1015"/> more common, it is to be hoped, in the last generation, than the warnings of physiologists will permit it to be with the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He thought to gain time, by bringing forward the intellect as early as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Thus I had tasks given me, as many and various as the hours would allow, and on subjects beyond my age; with the additional disadvantage of reciting to him in the evening, after he returned from his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>As he was subject to many interruptions, I was often kept up till very late; and as he was a severe teacher, both from his habits of mind and his ambition for me, my feelings were kept on the stretch till the recitations were over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Thus frequently, I was sent to bed several hours too late, with nerves unnaturally stimulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The consequence was a premature development of the brain, that made me a <q direct="unspecified">youthful prodigy</q> by day, and by night a victim of spectral illusions, nightmare, and somnambulism, which at the time prevented the harmonious development of my bodily powers and checked my growth, while, later, they induced continual headache, weakness and nervous affections, of all kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>As these again re-acted on the brain, giving undue force to every thought and every feeling, there was finally produced a state of being both too active and too intense, which wasted my constitution, and will bring me,&mdash;even although I have learned to understand and regulate my now morbid temperament, &mdash;to a premature grave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>No <num value="1">one</num> understood this subject of health then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>No <num value="1">one</num> knew why this child, already kept up so late, was still unwilling to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>My aunts cried out upon the <q direct="unspecified">spoiled child, the most unreasonable child that ever was,&mdash;if brother could but open his eyes to see it,&mdash;who was never willing to go to bed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>They did not know <pb id="p.1016" n="1016"/> that, so soon as the light was taken away, she seemed to see colossal faces advancing slowly towards her, the eyes dilating, and each feature swelling loathsomely as they came, till at last, when they were about to close upon her, she started up with a shriek which drove them away, but only to return when she lay down again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>They did not know that, when at last she went to sleep, it was to dream of horses trampling over her, and to awake once more in fright; or, as she had just read in her <persName><foreName>Virgil</foreName></persName>, of being among trees that dripped with blood, where she walked and walked and could not get out, while the blood became a pool and plashed over her feet, and rose higher and higher, till soon she dreamed it would reach her lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>No wonder the child arose and walked in her sleep, moaning all over the house, till once, when they heard her, and came and waked her, and she told what she had dreamed, her father sharply bid her <q direct="unspecified">leave off thinking of such nonsense, or she would be crazy,</q>&mdash; never knowing that he was himself the cause of all these horrors of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Often she dreamed of following to the grave the body of her mother, as she had done that of her sister, and woke to find the pillow drenched in tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>These dreams softened her heart too much, and cast a deep shadow over her young days; for then, and later, the life of dreams,&mdash; probably because there was in it less to distract the mind from its own earnestness,&mdash; has often seemed to her more real, and been remembered with more interest, than that of waking hours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Poor child!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Far remote in time, in thought, from that period, I look back on these glooms and terrors, wherein I was enveloped, and perceive that I had no natural childhood.</p></quote></div2>

<head>Books.</head> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Thus passed my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>My mother was in delicate health, and much absorbed in the care of her younger children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>In the house was neither dog nor bird, nor any graceful animated form of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>I saw no persons who took my fancy, and real life offered no attraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Thus my already over-excited mind found no relief from without, and was driven for refuge from itself to the world of books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I was taught Latin and <name>English</name> grammar at the same time, and began to read Latin at <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> old, after which, for some years, I read it daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>In this branch of study, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by my father, and afterwards by a tutor, I was trained to quite a high degree of precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>I was expected to understand the mechanism of the language thoroughly, and in translating to give the thoughts in as few well-arranged words as possible, and without breaks or hesitation,&mdash; for with these my father had absolutely no patience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Indeed, he demanded accuracy and clearness in everything: you must not speak, unless you can make your meaning perfectly intelligible to the person addressed; must not express a thought, unless you can give a reason for it, if required; must not make a statement, unless sure of all particulars&mdash;such were his rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/><q direct="unspecified">But,</q> <q direct="unspecified">if,</q> <q direct="unspecified">unless,</q> <q direct="unspecified">I am mistaken,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">it may be so,</q> were words and phrases excluded from the province where he held sway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Trained to great dexterity in artificial methods, accurate, ready, with entire command of his resources, he had no belief in minds that listen, wait, and receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He had no conception of the subtle and indirect motions of imagination and feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>His influence on me was great, and opposed to the natural <pb id="p.1018" n="1018"/> unfolding of my character, which was fervent, of strong grasp, and disposed to infatuation, and selfforget-fulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He made the common prose world so present to me, that my natural bias was controlled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I did not go mad, as many would do, at being continually roused from my dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>I had too much strength to be crushed,&mdash; and since I must put on the fetters, could not submit to let them impede my motions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>My own world sank deep within, away from the surface of my life; in what I did and said I learned to have reference to other minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>But my true life was only the dearer that it was secluded and veiled over by a thick curtain of available intellect, and that coarse, but wearable stuff woven by the ages,&mdash; <orgName n="Common Sense" type="newspaper">Common Sense</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>In accordance with this discipline in heroic common sense, was the influence of those great <persName n="Romans,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01018.00011" reg="mostcommon:Romans,nomatch:0"><surname>Romans</surname></persName>, whose thoughts and lives were my daily food during those plastic years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The genius of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> displayed itself in Character, and scarcely needed an occasional wave of the torch of thought to show its lineaments, so marble strong they gleamed in every light Who, that has lived with those men, but admires the plain force of fact, of thought passed into action?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>They take up things with their naked hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>There is just the man, and the block he casts before you,&mdash;no divinity, no demon, no unfulfilled aim, but just the man and <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, and what he did for <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Everything turns your attention to what a man can become, not by yielding himself freely to impressions, not by letting nature play freely through him, but by a single thought, an earnest purpose, an indomitable will, by hardihood, selfcom-mand, and force of expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Architecture was the art in which <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> excelled, and this corresponds with the <pb id="p.1019" n="1019"/> feeling these men of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> excite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>They did not grow, &mdash;they built themselves up, or were built up by the fate of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, as a temple for <persName n="Stator,,Jupiter,,," id="n0234.0001.01019.00012" reg="default:Stator,Jupiter,,,"><foreName>Jupiter</foreName> <surname>Stator</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The ruined <rs>Roman</rs> sits among the ruins; he flies to no green garden; he does not look to heaven; if his intent is defeated, if he is less than he meant to be, he lives no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The names which end in <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">us</hi>,</q> seem to speak with lyric cadence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>That measured cadence,&mdash;that tramp and march,&mdash; which are not stilted, because they indicate real force, yet which seem so when compared with any other language,&mdash; make Latin a study in itself of mighty influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The language alone, without the literature, would give <num value="1">one</num> the <hi rend="italics">thought</hi> of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The power of will, the dignity of a fixed purpose is what it utters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Every Roman was an emperor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>It is well that the infallible church should have been founded on this rock, that the presumptuous <rs>Peter</rs> should hold the keys, as the conquering <rs>Jove</rs> did before his thunderbolts, to be seen of all the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/></p> 
<p>Into my little room no care of his anger followed me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>My fancies swarmed like bees, as I contrived the rest of the story;&mdash;what all would do, what say, where go. My confinement tortured me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>&mdash;Often since I have seen the same misunderstanding between parent and child,&mdash;the parent thrusting the moral, the discipline, of life upon the child, when just engrossed by some game of real importance and great leadings to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>None but poets remember their youth; but the father who does not retain poetical apprehension of the world, free and splendid as it stretches out before the child, who cannot read his natural history, and follow out its intimations with reverence, must be a tyrant in his home, and the purest intentions will not prevent his doing much to cramp him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>They taught me to distrust all invention which is not based on a wide <pb id="p.1031" n="1031"/> experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Perhaps, too, they taught me to overvalue an outward experience at the expense of inward growth; but all this I did not appreciate till later.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It will be seen that my youth was not unfriended, since those great minds came to me in kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>A moment of action in <num value="1">one</num>'s self, however, is worth an age of apprehension through others; not that our deeds are better, but that they produce a renewal of our being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>I have had more productive moments and of deeper joy, but never hours of more tranquil pleasure than those in which these demi-gods visited me,&mdash;and with a smile so familiar, that I imagined the world to be full of such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>They did me good, for by them a standard was early given of sight and thought, from which I could never go back, and beneath which I cannot suffer patiently my own life or that of any friend to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>They did me harm, too, for the child fed with meat instead of milk becomes too soon mature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Expectations and desires were thus early raised, after which I must long toil before they can be realized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>How poor the scene around, how tame <num value="1">one</num>'s own existence, how meagre and faint every power, with these beings in my mind!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Often I must cast them quite aside in order to grow in my small way, and not sink into despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Certainly I do not wish that instead of these masters I had read baby books, written down to children, and with such ignorant dulness that they blunt the senses and corrupt the tastes of the still plastic human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>But I do wish that I had read no books at all till later,&mdash; that I had lived with toys, and played in the open air. Children should not cull the fruits of reflection and observation early, but expand in the sun, and let thoughts come to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>They should not through books antedate their <pb id="p.1032" n="1032"/> actual experiences, but should take them gradually, as sympathy and interpretation are needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>For a few months, this bookish and solitary life was invaded by interest in a living, breathing figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>At church, I used to look around with a feeling of coldness and disdain, which, though I now well understand its causes, seems to my wiser mind as odious as it was unnatural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The puny child sought everywhere for the <rs>Roman</rs> or <rs>Shakspeare</rs> figures, and she was met by the shrewd, honest eye, the homely decency, or the smartness of a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> village on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>There was beauty, but I could not see it then; it was not of the kind I longed for. In the next pew sat a family who were my especial aversion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>There were <num value="5">five</num> daughters, the eldest not above <num value="4">four</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>,&mdash; yet they had the old fairy, knowing look, hard, dry, dwarfed, strangers' to the <name>All</name>-Fair,&mdash; were working-day residents in this beautiful planet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>They looked as if their thoughts had never strayed beyond the jobs of the day, and they were glad of it. Their mother was <num value="1">one</num> of those shrunken, faded patterns of woman who have never done anything to keep smooth the cheek and dignify the brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The father had a Scotch look of shrewd narrowness, and entire self-complacency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>I could not endure this family, whose existence contradicted all my visions; yet I could not forbear looking at them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>As my eye <num value="1">one</num> day was ranging about with its accustomed coldness, and the proudly foolish sense of being in a shroud of thoughts that were not their <pb id="p.1033" n="1033"/> thoughts, it was arrested by a face most fair, and wellknown as it seemed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glance,&mdash; for surely I had met her before and waited for her long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>But soon I saw that she was a new apparition foreign to that scene, if not to me. Her dress,&mdash; the arrangement of her hair, which had the graceful pliancy of races highly cultivated for long,&mdash; the intelligent and full picture of her eye, whose reserve was in its self-possession, not in timidity, &mdash;all combined to make up a whole impression, which, though too young to understand, I was well prepared to feel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>How wearisome now appears that thorough-bred <hi rend="italics">millefleur</hi> beauty, the distilled result of ages of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> culture!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Give me rather the wild heath on the lonely hill-side, than such a rose-tree from the daintily clipped garden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>But, then, I had but tasted the cup, and knew not how little it could satisfy; more, more, was all my cry; continued through years, till I had been at the very fountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Indeed, it was a ruby-red, a perfumed draught, and I need not abuse the wine because I prefer water, but merely say I have had enough of it. Then, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> knowledge of such a person was intoxication.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>She was an English lady, who, by a singular chance, was cast upon this region for a few months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Elegant and captivating, her every look and gesture was tuned to a different pitch from anything I had ever known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>She was in various ways <q direct="unspecified">accomplished,</q> as it is called, though to what degree I cannot now judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>She painted in oils;&mdash; I had never before seen any <num value="1">one</num> fuse the brush, and days would not have been too long for me to watch the pictures growing beneath her hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>She played the harp; and its tones are still to me the <pb id="p.1034" n="1034"/> heralds of the promised land I saw before me then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>She rose, she looked, she spoke; and the gentle swaying motion she made all through life has gladdened memory, as the stream does the woods and meadows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>As she was often at the house of <num value="1">one</num> of our neighbors, and afterwards at our own, my thoughts were fixed on her with all the force of my nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> real interest in my kind, and it engrossed me wholly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>I had seen her,&mdash; I should see her,&mdash; and my mind lay steeped in the visions that flowed from this source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>My taskwork I went through with, as I have done on similar occasions all my life, aided by pride that could not bear to fail, or be questioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Could I cease from doing the work of the day, and hear the reason sneeringly given,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Her head is so completely taken up with&mdash;&mdash; that she can do nothing</q>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Should the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> love be blighted, they say, the mind loses its sense of eternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>All forms of existence seem fragile, the prison of time real, for a <name n="God" type="God">god</name> is dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Equally true is this of friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>I thank Heaven that this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> feeling was permitted its free flow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The years that lay between the woman and the girl only brought her beauty into perspective, and enabled me to see her as I did the mountains from my window, and made her presence to me a gate of Paradise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>That which she was, that which she brought, that which she might have brought, were mine, and over a whole region of new life I ruled proprietor of the soil in my own right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Her mind was sufficiently unoccupied to delight in my warm devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>She could not know what it was to me, but the light cast by the flare through so delicate a vase cheered and charmed her All who saw admired her in their way; but she would lightly turn her head <pb id="p.1035" n="1035"/> from their hard or oppressive looks, and fix a glance of full-eyed sweetness on the child, who, from a distance, watched all her looks and motions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>She did not say much to me&mdash;not much to any <num value="1">one</num>; she spoke in her whole being rather than by chosen words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Indeed, her proper speech was dance or song, and what was less expressive did not greatly interest her. But she saw much, having in its perfection the woman's delicate sense for sympathies and attractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>We walked in the fields, alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Though others were present, her eyes were gliding over all the field and plain for the objects of beauty to which she was of kin. She was not cold to her seeming companions; a sweet courtesy satisfied them, but it hung about her like her mantle that she wore without thinking of it; her thoughts were free, for these civilized beings can really live <num value="2">two</num> lives at the same moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>With them she seemed to be, but her hand was given to the child at her side; others did not observe me, but to her I was the only human presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Like a guardian spirit she led me through the fields and groves, and every tree, every bird greeted me, and said, what I felt, <q direct="unspecified">She is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> angel of your life.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/></p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> time I had been passing the afternoon with her. She had been playing to me on the harp, and I sat listening in happiness almost unbearable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Some guests were announced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>She went into another room to receive them, and I took up her book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It was <persName n="Mannering,,Guy,,," id="n0234.0001.01035.00040" reg="default:Mannering,Guy,,,"><foreName>Guy</foreName> <surname>Mannering</surname></persName>, then lately published, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01035.00041" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Walter,,,:2"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s novels I had ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>I opened where her mark lay, and read merely with the feeling of continuing our mutual existence by passing my eyes over the same page where hers had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>It was the description of the rocks on the sea-coast where the little <persName><foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> <pb id="p.1036" n="1036"/> <persName n="Bertram,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01036.00042" reg="mostcommon:Bertram,nomatch:0"><surname>Bertram</surname></persName> was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>I had never seen such places, and my mind was vividly stirred to imagine them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The scene rose before me, very unlike reality, doubtless, but majestic and wild.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>I was the little <rs>Harry Bertram</rs>, and had lost her,&mdash;all I had to lose,&mdash; and sought her vainly in long dark caves that had no end, plashing through the water; while the crags beetled above, threatening to fall and crush the poor child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Absorbed in the painful vision, tears rolled down my cheeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Just then she entered with light step, and full-beaming eye. When she saw me thus, a soft cloud stole over her face, and clothed every feature with a lovelier tenderness than I had seen there before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>She did not question, but fixed on me inquiring looks of beautiful love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>I laid my head against her shoulder and wept,&mdash; dimly feeling that I must lose her and all,&mdash; all who spoke to me of the same things,&mdash; that the cold wave must rush over me. She waited till my tears were spent, then rising, took from a little box a bunch of golden amaranths or everlasting flowers, and gave them to me. They were very fragrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/><q direct="unspecified">They came,</q> she said, <q direct="unspecified">from <placeName reg="Madeira, Putnam, Ohio" key="tgn,2478598">Madeira</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Whenever I saw a sail passing in the distance,&mdash; if it bore itself with fulness of beautiful certainty,&mdash;I felt that it was going to <placeName reg="Madeira, Putnam, Ohio" key="tgn,2478598">Madeira</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Those thoughts are all gone now. No <placeName reg="Madeira, Putnam, Ohio" key="tgn,2478598">Madeira</placeName> exists for me now,&mdash;no fortunate purple isle,&mdash; and all these hopes and fancies are lifted from the sea into the sky. Yet I thank the charms that fixed them here so long,&mdash; fixed them till perfumes like those of the golden flowers were drawn from the earth, teaching me to know my birth-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/><pb id="p.1037" n="1037"/></p> 
<p>I can tell little else of this time,&mdash;indeed, I remember little, except the state of feeling in which I lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>For I <hi rend="italics">lived</hi>, and when this is the case, there is little to tell in the form of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We meet&mdash;at least those who are true to their instincts meet&mdash;a succession of persons through our lives, all of whom have some peculiar errand to us. There is an outer circle, whose existence we perceive, but with whom we stand in no real relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>They tell us the news, they act on us in the offices of society, they show us kindness and aversion; but their influence does not penetrate; we are nothing to them, nor they to us, except as a part of the world's furniture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Another circle, within this, are dear and near to us. We know them and of what kind they are. They are to us not mere facts, but intelligible thoughts of the divine mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We like to see how they are unfolded; we like to meet them and part from them; we like their action upon us and the pause that succeeds and enables us to appreciate its quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Often we leave them on our path, and return no more, but we bear them in our memory, tales which have been told, and whose meaning has been felt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But yet a nearer group there are, beings born under the same star, and bound with us in a common destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>These are not mere acquaintances, mere friends, but, when we meet, are sharers of our very existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>There is no separation; the same thought is given at the same moment to both,&mdash;indeed, it is born of the meeting, and would not otherwise have been called into existence at all. These not only know themselves more, but <hi rend="italics">are</hi> more for having met, and regions of their being, which would else have laid sealed in cold obstruction, burst into leaf and bloom and song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/><pb id="p.1038" n="1038"/></p> 
<p>The times of these meetings are fated, nor will either party be able ever to meet any other person in the same way. Both seem to rise at a glance into that part of the heavens where the word can be spoken, by which they are revealed to <num value="1">one</num> another and to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The step in being thus gained, can never be lost, nor can it be re-trod; for neither party will be again what the other wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They are no longer fit to interchange mutual influence, for they do not really need it, and if they think they do, it is because they weakly pine after a past pleasure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>To this inmost circle of relations but few are admitted, because some prejudice or lack of courage has prevented the many from listening to their instincts the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time they manifested themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>If the voice is once disregarded it becomes fainter each time, till, at last, it is wholly silenced, and the man lives in this world, a stranger to its real life, deluded like the maniac who fancies he has attained his throne, while in reality he is on a bed of musty straw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Yet, if the voice finds a listener and servant the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time of speaking, it is encouraged to more and more clearness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Thus it was with me,&mdash;from no merit of mine, but because I had the good fortune to be free enough to yield to my impressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Common ties had not bound me; there were no traditionary notions in my mind; I believed in nothing merely because others believed in it; I had taken no feelings on trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Thus my mind was open to their sway.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>This woman came to me, a star from the east, a morning star, and I worshipped her. She too was elevated by that worship, and her fairest self called out. To the mind she brought assurance that there was a <pb id="p.1039" n="1039"/> region congenial with its tendencies and tastes, a region of elegant culture and intercourse, whose object, fulfilled or not, was to gratify the sense of beauty, not the mere utilities of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>In our relation she was lifted to the top of her being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>She had known many celebrities, had roused to passionate desire many hearts, and became afterwards a wife; but I do not believe she ever more truly realized her best self than towards the lonely child whose heaven she was, whose eye she met, and whose possibilities she predicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/><q direct="unspecified">He raised me,</q> said a woman inspired by love, <q direct="unspecified">upon the pedestal of his own high thoughts, and wings came at once, but I did not fly away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>I stood there with downcast eyes worthy of his love, for he had made me so.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/></p> 
<p>Thus we do always for those who inspire us to expect from them the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>That which they are able to be, they become, because we demand it of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/><q direct="unspecified">We expect the impossible&mdash;and find it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/></p> 
<p>My <name>English</name> friend went across the sea. She passed into her former life, and into ties that engrossed her days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>But she has never ceased to think of me. Her thoughts turn forcibly back to the child who was to her all she saw of the really <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>On the promised coasts she had found only cities, careful men and women, the aims and habits of ordinary life in her own land, without that elegant culture which she, probably, overestimated, because it was her home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>But in the mind of the child she found the fresh prairie, the untrodden forests for which she had longed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>I saw in her the storied castles, the fair stately parks and the wind laden with tones from the past, which I desired to know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>We wrote to <num value="1">one</num> another for many years;&mdash;her shallow and delicate epistles did not disenchant me, nor did she fail to <pb id="p.1040" n="1040"/> see something of the old poetry in my rude characters and stammering speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>But we must never meet again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>When this friend was withdrawn I fell into a profound depression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>I knew not how to exert myself, but lay bound hand and foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Melancholy enfolded me in an atmosphere, as joy had done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>This suffering, too, was out of the gradual and natural course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Those who are really children could not know such love, or feel such sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/><q direct="unspecified">I am to blame,</q> said my father, <q direct="unspecified">in keeping her at home so long merely to please myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>She needs to be with other girls, needs play and variety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>She does not seem to me really sick, but dull rather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>She eats nothing, you say. I see she grows thin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>She ought to change the scene.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/></p> 
<p>I was indeed <hi rend="italics">dull</hi>. The books, the garden, had lost all charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>I had the excuse of headache, constantly, for not attending to my lessons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The light of life was set, and every leaf was withered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>At such an early age there are no back or side scenes where the mind, weary and sorrowful, may retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Older, we realize the width of the world more, and it is not easy to despair on any point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The effort at thought to which we are compelled relieves and affords a dreary retreat, like hiding in a brick-kiln till the shower be over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>But then all joy seemed to have departed with my friend, and the emptiness of our house stood revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>This I had not felt while I every day expected to see or had seen her, or annoyance and dulness were unnoticed or swallowed up in the <num value="1">one</num> thought that clothed my days with beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>But now she was gone, and I was roused from habits of reading or reverie to feel the fiery temper of the soul, and to learn that it must have vent, that it would not be pacified by shadows, neither meet without consuming <pb id="p.1041" n="1041"/> what lay around it. I avoided the table as much as possible, took long walks and lay in bed, or on the floor of my room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>I complained of my head, and it was not wrong to do so, for a sense of dulness and suffocation, if not pain, was there constantly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>But when it was proposed that I should go to school, that was a remedy I could not listen to with patience for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The peculiarity of my education had separated me entirely from the girls around, except that when they were playing at active games, <num value="1">1</num> would sometimes go out and join them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>I liked violent bodily exercise, which always relieved my nerves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>But I had no success in associating with them beyond the mere play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Not only I was not their school-mate, but my book-life and lonely habits had given a cold aloofness to my whole expression, and veiled my manner with a hanteur which turned all hearts away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Yet, as this reserve was superficial, and rather ignorance than arrogance, it produced no deep dislike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Besides, the girls supposed me really superior to themselves, and did not hate me for feeling it, but neither did they like me, nor wish to have me with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Indeed, I had gradually given up all such wishes myself; for they seemed to me rude, tiresome, and childish, as I did to them dull and strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>This experience had been earlier, before I was admitted to any real friendship; but now that I had been lifted into the life of mature years, and into just that atmosphere of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> life to which I had before been tending, the thought of sending me to school filled me with disgust.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Yet what could I tell my father of such feelings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>I resisted all I could, but in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>He had no faith in medical aid generally, and justly saw that this was no <pb id="p.1042" n="1042"/> occasion for its use. He thought I needed change of scene, and to be roused to activity by other children <q direct="unspecified">I have kept you at home,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">because I took such pleasure in teaching you myself, and besides I knew that you would learn faster with <num value="1">one</num> who is so desirous to aid you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Yet there was a vein of haughty caprice in her character, and a love of solitude, which made her at times wish to retire apart, and at these times she would expect to be entirely understood, and let alone, yet to be welcomed back when she returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>She did not thwart <pb id="p.1043" n="1043"/> others in their humors, but she never doubted of great indulgence from them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Some singular habits she had, which, when new, charmed, but, after acquaintance, displeased her companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>She had by nature the same habit and power of excitement that is described in the spinning dervishes of the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Like them she would spin until all around her were giddy, while her own brain, instead of being disturbed, was excited to great action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Pausing, she would declaim verses of others, or her own, or act many parts, with strange catchwords and burdens, that seemed to act with mystical power on her own fancy, sometimes stimulating her to convulse the hearers with laughter, sometimes to melt them to tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>When her power began to languish, she would spin again till fired to re-commence her singular drama, into which she wove figures from the scenes of her earlier childhood, her companions, and the dignitaries she sometimes saw, with fantasies unknown to life, unknown to heaven or earth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>This excitement, as may be supposed, was not good for her. It usually came on in the evening, and often spoiled her sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>She would wake in the night, and cheat her restlessness by inventions that teased, while they sometimes diverted her companions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>She was also a sleep-walker; and this <num value="1">one</num> trait of her case did somewhat alarm her guardians, who, otherwise, showed the profound ignorance as to this peculiar being, usual in the overseeing of the young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>They consulted a physician, who said she would outgrow it, and prescribed a milk diet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Meantime, the fever of this ardent and too early stimulated nature was constantly increased by the restraints and narrow routine of the boarding-school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>She was <pb id="p.1044" n="1044"/> always devising means to break in upon it. She had a taste&mdash;which would have seemed ludicrous to her mates, if they had not felt some awe of her, from the touch of genius and power that never left her&mdash;for costume and fancy dresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>There was always some sash twisted about her, some drapery, something odd in the arrangement of her hair and dress; so that the methodical preceptress dared not let her go out without a careful scrutiny and remodelling, whose soberizing effects generally disappeared the moment she was in the free air.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>At last a vent was assured for her in private theatricals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Play followed play, and in these and the rehearsals, she found entertainment congenial with her. The principal parts, as a matter of course, fell to her lot; most of the good suggestions and arrangements came from her; and, for a time, she ruled mostly, and shone triumphant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>During these performances, the girls had heightened their bloom with artificial red; this was delightful to them, it was something so out of the way. But <persName n="Mariana,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01044.00043" reg="mostcommon:Mariana,nomatch:0"><surname>Mariana</surname></persName>, after the plays were over, kept her carmine saucer on the dressing-table, and put on her blushes, regularly as the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>When stared and jeered at, she at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> said she did it because she thought it made her look pretty; but, after a while, she became petulant about it,&mdash; would make no reply to any joke, but merely kept up the habit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>This irritated the girls, as all eccentricity does the world in general, more than vice or malignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>They talked it over among themselves till they were wrought up to a desire of punishing, once for all, this sometimes amusing, but so often provoking non-conformist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>And having obtained leave of the mistress, they laid with <pb id="p.1045" n="1045"/> great glee, a plan, <num value="1">one</num> evening, which was to be carried into execution next day at dinner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Among <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName>'s irregularities was a great aversion to the meal-time ceremonial,&mdash;so long, so tiresome, she found it, to be seated at a certain moment, and to wait while each <num value="1">one</num> was served, at so large a table, where there was scarcely any conversation; and from day to day it became more heavy to sit there, or go there at all; often as possible she excused herself on the everconvenient plea of headache, and was hardly ever ready when the dinner-bell rang.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>To-day the summons found her on the balcony, but gazing on the beautiful prospect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>I have heard her say afterwards, that she had scarcely in her life been so happy,&mdash;and she was <num value="1">one</num> with whom happiness was a still rapture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the most blessed summer days; the shadows of great white clouds empurpled the distant hills for a few moments, only to leave them more golden; the tall grass of the wide fields waved in the softest breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Pure blue were the heavens, and the same hue of pure contentment was in the heart of <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Suddenly on her bright mood jarred the dinner-bell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rose her usual thought, I will not, cannot go; and then the <hi rend="italics">must</hi>, which daily life can always enforce, even upon the butterflies and birds, came, and she walked reluctantly to her room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>She merely changed her dress, and never thought of adding the artificial rose to her cheek.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>When she took her seat in the dining-hall, and was asked if she would be helped, raising her eyes, she saw the person who asked her was deeply rouged, with a bright glaring spot, perfectly round, on either cheek <pb id="p.1046" n="1046"/> She looked at the next,&mdash; same apparition!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>She then slowly passed her eyes down the whole line, and saw the same, with a suppressed smile distorting every countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Catching the design at once, she deliberately looked along her own side of the table, at every schoolmate in turn; every <num value="1">one</num> had joined in the trick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The teachers strove to be grave, but she saw they enjoyed the joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The servants could not suppress a titter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>When <persName n="Hastings,,Warren,,," id="n0234.0001.01046.00044" reg="default:Hastings,Warren,,,"><foreName>Warren</foreName> <surname>Hastings</surname></persName> stood at the bar of <placeName reg="Westminster Hall">Westminster Hall</placeName>,&mdash;when the <rs>Methodist</rs> preacher walked through a line of men, each of whom greeted him with a brickbat or rotten egg,&mdash;they had some preparation for the crisis, though it might be very difficult to meet it with an impassible brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Our little girl was quite unprepared to find herself in the midst of a world which despised her, and triumphed in her disgrace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>She had ruled like a queen, in the midst of her companions; she had shed her animation through their lives, and loaded them with prodigal favors, nor once suspected that a popular favorite might not be loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Now she felt that she had been but a dangerous plaything in the hands of those whose hearts she never had doubted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Yet the occasion found her equal to it, for <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName> had the kind of spirit which, in a better cause, had made the <rs>Roman</rs> matron truly say of her death-wound, <q direct="unspecified">It is not painful, Poetus.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>She did not blench,&mdash;she did not change countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>She swallowed her dinner with apparent composure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>She made remarks to those near her, as if she had no eyes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The wrath of the foe, of course, rose higher, and the moment they were freed from the restraints of the dining <pb id="p.1047" n="1047"/> room, they all ran off, gayly calling, and sarcastically laughing, with backward glances, at <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName>, left alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Alone she went to her room, locked the door, and threw herself on the floor in strong convulsions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>These had sometimes threatened her life, in earlier childhood, but of later years she had outgrown them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Schoolhours came, and she was not there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>A little girl, sent to her door, could get no answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The teachers became alarmed, and broke it open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Bitter was their penitence, and that of her companions, at the state in which they found her. For some hours terrible anxiety was felt, but at last nature, exhausted, relieved herself by a deep slumber.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>From this <persName n="Mariana,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01047.00045" reg="mostcommon:Mariana,nomatch:0"><surname>Mariana</surname></persName> arose an altered being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>She made no reply to the expressions of sorrow from her companions, none to the grave and kind, but undiscerning, comments of her teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>She did not name the source of her anguish, and its poisoned dart sank deeply in. This was the thought which stung her so:&mdash; <q direct="unspecified">What, not <num value="1">one</num>, not a single <num value="1">one</num>, in the hour of trial, to take my part?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>not <num value="1">one</num> who refused to take part against me?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Past words of love, and caresses, little heeded at the time, rose to her memory, and gave fuel to her distempered heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Beyond the sense of burning resentment at universal perfidy, she could not get. And <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName>, born for love, now hated all the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The change, however, which these feelings made in her conduct and appearance, bore no such construction to the careless observer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Her gay freaks were quite gone, her wildness, her invention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Her dress was uniform, her manner much subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Her chief interest seemed to be now in her studies, and in music Her <pb id="p.1048" n="1048"/> companions she never sought; but they, partly from uneasy, remorseful feelings, partly that they really liked her much better now that she did not puzzle and oppress them, sought her continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>And here the black shadow cones upon her life, the only stain upon the history of <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>They talked to her, as girls having few topics naturally do, of <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Then the demon rose within her, and spontaneously, without design, generally without words of positive falsehood, she became a genius of discord amongst them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>She fanned those flames of envy and jealousy which a wise, true word from <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> person will often quench forever; and by a glance, or seemingly light reply, she planted the seeds of dissension, till there was scarcely a peaceful affection, or sincere intimacy, in the circle where she lived, and could not but rule, for she was <num value="1">one</num> whose nature was to that of the others as fire to clay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>It was at this time that I came to the school, and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw <persName n="Mariana,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01048.00046" reg="mostcommon:Mariana,nomatch:0"><surname>Mariana</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Me she charmed at once, for I was a sentimental child, who, in my early ill health, had been indulged in reading novels, till I had no eyes for the common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>It was not, however, easy to approach her. Did I offer to run and fetch her handkerchief, she was obliged to go to her room, and would rather do it herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>She did not like to have people turn over for her the leaves of the music-book as she played.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Did I approach my stool to her feet, she moved away as if to give me room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The bunch of wild flowers, which I timidly laid beside her plate, was left untouched.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>After some weeks, my desire to attract her notice really preyed upon me; and <num value="1">one</num> day, meeting her alone in the entry, I fell upon my knees, and, kissing her hand, cried, <pb id="p.1049" n="1049"/> <q direct="unspecified">O, <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName>, do let me love you, and try to love me a little!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>But my idol snatched away her hand, and laughing wildly, ran into her room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>After that day, her manner to me was not only cold, but repulsive, and I felt myself scorned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Perhaps <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> had passed thus, when, <num value="1">one</num> afternoon, it became obvious that something more than common was brewing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Dismay and mystery were written in many faces of the older girls; much whispering was going on in corners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>In the evening, after prayers, the principal bade us stay; and, in a grave, sad voice, summoned forth <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName> to answer charges to be made against her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/><placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName> stood up and leaned against the chimneypiece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Then <num value="8">eight</num> of the older girls came forward, and preferred against her charges,&mdash; alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>too well founded, of calumny and falsehood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, she defended herself with self-possession and eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>But when she found she could no more resist the truth, she suddenly threw herself down, dashing her head with all her force against the iron hearth, on which a fire was burning, and was taken up senseless.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The affright of those present was great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Now that they had perhaps killed her, they reflected it would have been as well if they had taken warning from the former occasion, and approached very carefully a nature so capable of any extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>After a while she revived, with a faint groan, amid the sobs of her companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>I was on my knees by the bed, and held her cold hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/><num value="1">One</num> of those most aggrieved took it from me, to beg her pardon, and say, it was impossible not to love her. She made no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/><pb id="p.1050" n="1050"/></p> 
<p>Neither that night, nor for several days, could a word be obtained from her, nor would she touch food; but, when it was presented to her, or any <num value="1">one</num> drew near from any cause, she merely turned away her head, and gave no sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The teacher saw that some terrible nervous affection had fallen upon her&mdash;that she grew more and more feverish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>She knew not what to do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Meanwhile, a new revolution had taken place in the mind of the passionate but nobly-tempered child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>All these months nothing but the sense of injury had rankled in her heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>She had gone on in <num value="1">one</num> mood, doing what the demon prompted, without scruple, and without fear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>But at the moment of detection, the tide ebbed, and the bottom of her soul lay revealed to her eye. How black, how stained, and sad!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Strange, strange, that she had not seen before the baseness and cruelty of falsehood, the loveliness of truth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Now, amid the wreck, uprose the moral nature, which never before had attained the ascendant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/><q direct="unspecified">But,</q> she thought, <q direct="unspecified">too late sin is revealed to me in all its deformity, and sin-defiled, I will not, cannot live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The main-spring of life is broken.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/></p> 
<p>The lady who took charge of this sad child had never well understood her before, but had always looked on her with great tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>And now love seemed,&mdash;when all around were in the greatest distress, fearing to call in medical aid, fearing to do without it,&mdash;to teach her where the only balm was to be found that could heal the wounded spirit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/><num value="1">One</num> night she came in, bringing a calming draught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/><placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName> was sitting as usual, her hair loose, her dress the same robe they had put on her at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, her eyes <pb id="p.1051" n="1051"/> fixed vacantly upon the whited wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>To the proffers and entreaties of her nurse, she made no reply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>The lady burst into tears, but <persName n="Mariana,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01051.00047" reg="mostcommon:Mariana,nomatch:0"><surname>Mariana</surname></persName> did not seem even to observe it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>The lady then said, <q direct="unspecified">O, my child, do not despair; do not think that <num value="1">one</num> great fault can mar a whole life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Let me trust you; let me tell you the griefs of my sad life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>I will tell you, <placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName>, what I never expected to impart to any <num value="1">one</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/></p> 
<p>And so she told her tale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of pain, of shame, borne not for herself, but for <num value="1">one</num> near and dear as herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/><placeName reg="Mariana, Haute-Corse, Corsica" key="tgn,4006919">Mariana</placeName> knew the dignity and reserve of this lady's nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>She had often admired to see how the cheek, lovely, but no longer young, mantled with the deepest blush of youth, and the blue eyes were cast down at any little emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>She had understood the proud sensibility of her character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>She fixed her eyes on those now raised to hers, bright with fastfall-ing tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>She heard the story to the end, and then, without saying a word, stretched out her hand for the cup.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>She returned to life, but it was as <num value="1">one</num> who had passed through the valley of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The heart of stone was quite broken in her,&mdash;the fiery will fallen from flame to coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>When her strength was a little restored, she had all her companions summoned, and said to them,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">I deserved to die, but a generous trust has called me back to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>I will be worthy of it, nor ever betray the trust, or resent injury more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>Can you forgive the past?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/></p> 
<p>And they not only forgave, but, with love and earnest tears, clasped in their arms the returning sister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>They vied with <num value="1">one</num> another in offices of humble love <pb id="p.1052" n="1052"/> to the humbled <num value="1">one</num>; and let it be recorded, as an instance of the pure honor of which young hearts are capable, that these facts, known to some <num value="40">forty</num> persons, never, so far as I know, transpired beyond those walls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>It was not long after this that <persName n="Mariana,,,,," id="n0234.0001.01052.00048" reg="mostcommon:Mariana,nomatch:0"><surname>Mariana</surname></persName> was summoned home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>She went thither a wonderfully instructed being, though in ways those who had sent her forth to learn little dreamed of.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>The next note which I shall give was written not many days after, and is in quite a different vein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>It is <pb id="p.1064" n="1064"/> memorable to me as laying the foundation of a friendship which brought light to my mind, which enlarged my heart, and gave elevation and energy to my aims and purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>For nearly <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> remained true to the pledges of this note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>In a few years we were separated, but our friendship remained firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Living in different parts of the country, occupied with different thoughts and duties, making other friends,&mdash;sometimes not seeing nor hearing from each other for months,&mdash;we never met without my feeling that she was ready to be interested in all my thoughts, to love those whom I loved, to watch my progress, to rebuke my faults and follies, to encourage within me every generous and pure aspiration, to demand of me, always, the best that I could be or do, and to be satisfied with no mediocrity, no conformity to any low standard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>And what she thus was to me, she was to many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Inexhaustible in power of insight, and with a good-will <q direct="unspecified">broad as ether,</q> she could enter into the needs, and sympathize with the various excellences, of the greatest variety of characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/><num value="1">One</num> thing only she demanded of all her friends,&mdash;that they should have some <q direct="unspecified">extraordinary generous seeking,</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> 
<p>These words of <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01064.00088" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, which I have placed among the mottoes at the beginning of this chapter, were written by <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> page of a richly gilt and bound blank book, which she gave to me, in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>, for a private journal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The words of <persName n="Korner,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01064.00089" reg="mostcommon:Korner,nomatch:0"><surname>Korner</surname></persName> are also translated by herself, and were given to me about the same time</p></note> that they should not be satisfied with the common routine of life,&mdash;that they should aspire to something higher, better, holier, than they had now attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Where this element of aspiration existed, she demanded no originality of intellect, no greatness of soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>If these were found, well; but she could love, <pb id="p.1065" n="1065"/> tenderly and truly, where they were not. But for a worldly character, however gifted, she felt and expressed something very like contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>At this period, she had no patience with self-satisfied mediocrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>She afterwards learned patience and unlearned contempt; but at the time of which I write, she seemed, and was to the multitude, a haughty and supercilious person,&mdash;while to those whom she loved, she was all the more gentle, tender and true.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> possessed, in a greater degree than any person I ever knew, the power of so magnetizing others, when she wished, by the power of her mind, that they would lay open to her all the secrets of their nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>She had an infinite curiosity to know individuals,&mdash;not the vulgar curiosity which seeks to find out the circumstances of their outward lives, but that which longs to understand the inward springs of thought and action in their souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>This desire and power both rested on a profound conviction of her mind in the individuality of every human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>A human being, according to her faith, was not the result of the presence and stamp of outward circumstances, but an original <hi rend="italics">monad</hi>, with a certain special faculty, capable of a certain fixed development, and having a profound personal unity, which the ages of eternity might develop, but could not exhaust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>I know not if she would have stated her faith in these terms, but some such conviction appeared in her constant endeavor to see and understand the germinal principle, the special characteristic, of every person whom she deemed worthy of knowing at all. Therefore, while some persons study human nature in its universal laws, and become great philosophers, moralists and teachers of the race,&mdash;while others study mankind in action, and, seeing the motives <pb id="p.1066" n="1066"/> and feelings by which masses are swayed, become eminent politicians, sagacious leaders, and eminent in all political affairs,&mdash;a few, like <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, study character, and acquire the power of exerting profoundest influence on individual souls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>I had expressed to her my desire to know something of the history of her mind,&mdash;to understand her aims, her hopes, her views of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>In a note written in reply, she answered me thus: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>I cannot bring myself to write you what you wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>You would be disappointed, at any rate, after all the solemn note of preparation; the consciousness of this would chill me now. Besides, I cannot be willing to leave with you such absolute <hi rend="italics">vagaries</hi> in a tangible, examinable shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>I think of your after-smiles, of your colder moods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>But I will tell you, when a fitting opportunity presents, all that can interest you, and perhaps more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>And excuse my caution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>I do not profess, I may not dare, to be generous in these matters.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>To this I replied to the effect that, <q direct="unspecified">in my coldest mood I could not criticize words written in a confiding spirit;</q> and that, at all events, she must not expect of me a confidence which she dared not return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>This was the substance of a note to which <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> thus replied:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>I thank you for your note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/><measure n="10minutes" type="date">Ten minutes</measure> before I received it, I scarcely thought that anything again would make my stifled heart throb so warm a pulse of pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Excuse my cold doubts, my selfish arrogance, &mdash;you will, when I tell you that this experiment has before had such uniform results; those who professed <pb id="p.1067" n="1067"/> to seek my friendship, and whom, indeed, I have often truly loved, have always learned to content themselves with that inequality in the connection which I have never striven to veil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Indeed, I have thought myself more valued and better beloved, because the sympathy, the interest, were all on my side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>True! such regard could never flatter my pride, nor gratify my affections, since it was paid not to myself, but to the need they had of me; still, it was dear and pleasing, as it has given me an opportunity of knowing and serving many lovely characters; and I cannot see that there is anything else for me to do on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>And I should rejoice to cultivate generosity, since (see that <hi rend="italics">since</hi>) affections gentler and more sympathetic are denied me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>I would have been a true friend to you; ever ready to solace your pains and partake your joy as far as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Yet I cannot but rejoice that I have met a person who could discriminate and reject a proffer of this sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> ago I should have ventured to proffer you friendship, indeed, on seeing such an instance of pride in you; but I have gone through a sad process of feeling since, and those emotions, so necessarily repressed, have lost their simplicity, their ardent beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/><hi rend="italics">Then</hi>, there was nothing I might not have disclosed to a person capable of comprehending, had I ever seen such an <num value="1">one</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Now there are many voices of the soul which I imperiously silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>This results not from any particular circumstance or event, but from a gradual ascertaining of realities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>I cannot promise you any limitless confidence, but I <hi rend="italics">can</hi> promise that no timid caution, no haughty dread shall prevent my telling you the truth of my thoughts <pb id="p.1068" n="1068"/> on any subject we may have in common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Will this satisfy you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Oh let it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>suffer me to know <hi rend="italics">you</hi>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>In a postscript she adds, <quote>No other cousin or friend of any style is to see this note.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>So for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> it has lain unseen, but for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> did we remain true to the pledges of that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>And now that noble heart sleeps beneath the tossing <rs>Atlantic</rs>, and I feel no reluctance in showing to the world this expression of pure youthful ardor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>It may, perhaps, lead some wise worldlings, who doubt the possibility of such a relation, to reconsider the grounds of their scepticism; or, if not that, it may encourage some youthful souls, as earnest and eager as ours, to trust themselves to their hearts' impulse, and enjoy some such blessing as came to us.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>I have, nathless, after a <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> reverie, to which this resolve and its preliminaries have formed excellent warp, determined to sacrifice this hallowed time to you.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>I had imagined a person endowed by nature with that acute sense of Beauty, (<hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., Harmony or Truth,) and that vast capacity of desire, which give soul to love and ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>I had wished this person might grow up to manhood alone (but not alone in crowds); I would have placed him in a situation so retired, so obscure, that he would quietly, but without bitter sense of isolation, stand apart from all surrounding him. I would have had him go on steadily, feeding his mind with congenial love, hopefully confident that if he only nourished his existence into perfect life, Fate would, at fitting season, furnish an atmosphere and orbit meet for his breathing and exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>I wished he might adore, not fever for, the bright phantoms of his mind's creation, and believe them but the shadows of external things to be met with hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>After this steady intellectual growth had brought his powers to manhood, so far as the ideal can do it, I wished this being might be launched into the world of realities, his heart glowing with the ardor of an immortal toward perfection, <pb id="p.1070" n="1070"/> his eyes searching everywhere to behold it; I wished he might collect into <num value="1">one</num> burning point those withering, palsying convictions, which, in the ordinary routine of things, so gradually pervade the soul; that he might suffer, in brief space, agonies of disappointment commensurate with his unpreparedness and confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>And I thought, thus thrown back on the representing pictorial resources I supposed him originally to possess, with such material, and the need he must feel of using it, such a man would suddenly dilate into a form of Pride, Power, and Glory,&mdash; a centre, round which asking, aimless hearts might rally,&mdash;a man fitted to act as interpreter to the <num value="1">one</num> tale of many-languaged eyes!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>What words are these!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>In giving some account of her in these relations, there is only the alternative of a prudent reserve which omits whatever is liable to be misunderstood, or a frank utterance which confides in the good sense and right feeling of the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>By the last course, we run the risk of allowing our friend to be misunderstood; but by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we make it certain that the most important part of her character shall not be understood at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>He had with him his son, a wild boy of <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> old, all brilliant with health and energy, and with the same powerful eye.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s constancy to any genuine relation, once established, was surprising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>If her friends' <hi rend="italics">aim</hi> changed, so as to take them out of her sphere, she was saddened by it, and did not let them go without a struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>But wherever they continued <q direct="unspecified">true to the original standard,</q> (as she loved to phrase it) her affectionate interest would follow them unimpaired through all the changes of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>She never formed a friendship until she had seen and known this germ of good; and afterwards judged conduct by this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>But never did she act like those who so often judge of their friend from some report of his conduct, as if they had never known him, and allow the inference from a single act to alter the opinion formed by an induction from years of intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/><pb id="p.1078" n="1078"/> From all such weakness <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> stood wholly free.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>I have referred to the wide range of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s friendships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Even at this period this variety was very apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>She was the centre of a group very different from each other, and whose only affinity consisted in their all being polarized by the strong attraction of her mind,&mdash;all drawn toward herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>Some of her friends were young, gay and beautiful; some old, sick or studious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Some were children of the world, others pale scholars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Some were witty, others slightly dull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>But all, in order to be <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s friends, must be capable of seeking something,&mdash; capable of some aspiration for the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>And how did she glorify life to all!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>all that was tame and common vanishing away in the picturesque light thrown over the most familiar things by her rapid fancy, her brilliant wit, her sharp insight, her creative imagination, by the inexhaustible resources of her knowledge, and the copious rhetoric which found words and images always apt and always ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Even then she displayed almost the same marvellous gift of conversation which afterwards dazzled all who knew her,&mdash; with more perhaps of freedom, since she floated on the flood of our warm sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Those who know <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> only by her published writings know her least; her notes and letters contain more of her mind; but it was only in conversation that she was perfectly free and at home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s constancy in friendship caused her to demand it in others, and thus she was sometimes exacting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>But the pure Truth of her character caused her to express all such feelings with that freedom and simplicity that they became only as slight clouds on a serene <pb id="p.1079" n="1079"/> sky, giving it a tenderer beauty, and casting picturesque shades over the landscape below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>From her letters to different friends I select a few examples of these feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>In an unfinished tale, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> has given the following studies of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>She is describing <num value="2">two</num> of the friends of the hero of her story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>Unquestionably the traits here given were taken from life, though it might not be easy to recognize the portrait of any individual in either sketch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Yet we insert it here to show her own idea of this relation, and her fine feeling of the action and reaction of these subtle intimacies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>Now, however, I found companions, in thought, at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/><num value="1">One</num>, who had great effect on my mind, I may call <persName n="Lytton,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01087.00108" reg="mostcommon:Lytton,nomatch:0"><surname>Lytton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>He was as premature as myself; at <num value="13">thirteen</num> a man in the range of his thoughts, analyzing motives, and explaining principles, when he ought to have been playing cricket, or hunting in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>The young <rs>Arab</rs>, or <address><street n="Indian burial">Indian</street></address>, may dispense with mere play, and enter betimes into the histories and practices of manhood, for all these are, in their modes of life, closely connected with simple nature, and educate the body no less than the mind; but the same good cannot be said of lounging lazily under a tree, while mentally accompanying <persName n="Blas,,Gil,,," id="n0234.0002.01087.00109" reg="default:Blas,Gil,,,"><foreName>Gil</foreName> <surname>Blas</surname></persName> through his course of intrigue and adventure, and visiting with him the impure atmosphere of courtiers, picaroons, and actresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>This was <persName n="Lytton,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01087.00110" reg="mostcommon:Lytton,nomatch:0"><surname>Lytton</surname></persName>'s favorite reading; his mind, by nature subtle rather than daring, would in any case have found its food in the now hidden workings of character and passion, the by-play of life, the unexpected and seemingly incongruous relations to be found there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>He loved the natural history of man, not religiously, but for entertainment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>What he sought, he found, but paid the heaviest price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>All his later days were poisoned by his subtlety, which made it impossible for him <pb id="p.1088" n="1088"/> to look at any action with a single and satisfied eye. He tore the buds open to see if there were no worm sheathed in the blushful heart, and was so afraid of overlooking some mean possibility, that he lost sight of virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/><persName n="Grubbing,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01088.00111" reg="mostcommon:Grubbing,nomatch:0"><surname>Grubbing</surname></persName> like a mole beneath the surface of earth, rather than reading its living language above, he had not faith enough to believe in the flower, neither faith enough to mine for the gem, and remains at penance in the limbo of halfnesses, I trust not forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>Then all his characteristics wore brilliant hues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>He was very witty, and I owe to him the great obligation of being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and only person who has excited me to frequent and boundless gayety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>The sparks of his wit were frequent, slight surprises; his was a slender dart, and rebounded easily to the hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>I like the scintillating, arrowy wit far better than broad, genial humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>The light metallic touch pleases me. When wit appears as fun and jollity, she wears a little of the <name>Silenus</name> air;&mdash;the <name>Mercurial</name> is what I like.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>In later days,&mdash;for my intimacy with him lasted many years,&mdash;he became the feeder of my intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>He delighted to ransack the history of a nation, of an art or a science, and bring to me all the particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>Telling them fixed them in his own memory, which was the most tenacious and ready I have ever known; he enjoyed my clear perception as to their relative value, and I classified them in my own way. As he was omnivorous, and of great mental activity, while my mind was intense, though rapid in its movements, and could only give itself to a few things of its own accord, I traversed on the wings of his effort large demesnes that would otherwise have remained quite unknown to me. They were not, indeed, seen to the same profit <pb id="p.1089" n="1089"/> as my own province, whose tillage I knew, and whose fruits were the answer to my desire; but the fact of seeing them at all gave a largeness to my view, and a candor to my judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>I could not be ignorant how much there was I did not know, nor leave out of sight the many sides to every question, while, by the law of affinity, I chose my own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/><persName n="Lytton,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01089.00112" reg="mostcommon:Lytton,nomatch:0"><surname>Lytton</surname></persName> was not loved by any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>He was not positively hated, or disliked; for there was nothing which the general mind could take firm hold of enough for such feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Cold, intangible, he was to play across the life of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>A momentary resentment was sometimes felt at a presence which would not mingle with theirs; his scrutiny, though not hostile, was recognized as unfeeling and impertinent, and his mirth unsettled all objects from their foundations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>But he was soon forgiven and forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>Hearts went not forth to war against or to seek <num value="1">one</num> who was a mere experimentalist and observer in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>For myself, I did not love, perhaps, but was attached to him, and the attachment grew steadily, for it was founded, not on what I wanted of him, but on his truth to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>His existence was a real <num value="1">one</num>; he was not without a pathetic feeling of his wants, but was never tempted to supply them by imitating the properties of any other character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>He accepted the law of his being, and never violated it. This is next best to the nobleness which transcends it. I did not disapprove, even when I disliked, his acts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Amadin, my other companion, was as slow and deep of feeling, as <persName n="Lytton,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01089.00113" reg="mostcommon:Lytton,nomatch:0"><surname>Lytton</surname></persName> was brilliant, versatile, and cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>His temperament was generally grave, even to apparent dulness; his eye gave little light, but a slow fire <pb id="p.1090" n="1090"/> burned in its depths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>His was a character not to be revealed to himself, or others, except by the important occasions of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Though every day, no doubt, deepened and enriched him, it brought little that he could show or recall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>But when his soul, capable of religion, capable of love, was moved, all his senses were united in the word or action that followed, and the impression made on you was entire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>I have scarcely known any capable of such true manliness as he. His poetry, written, or unwritten, was the experience of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>It lies in few lines, as yet, but not <num value="1">one</num> of them will ever need to be effaced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>Early that serious eye inspired in me a trust that has never been deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>There was no magnetism in him, no lights and shades that could stir the imagination; no bright ideal suggested by him stood between the friend and his self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>As the years matured that self, I loved him more, and knew him as he knew himself, always in the present moment; he could never occupy my mind in absence.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>Somewhat older than <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, and having enjoyed an education at a German university, his conversation was full of interest and excitement to her. He opened to her a whole world of thoughts and speculations which gave movement to her mind in a congenial direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was then about <num value="13">thirteen</num>,&mdash;a child in years, but so precocious in her mental and physical developments, that she passed for <num value="18">eighteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>Agreeably to this estimate, she had her place in society, as a lady full-grown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/><quote rend="blockquote">

<p>When I recall her personal appearance, as it was then and for <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> subsequent to this, I have the idea of a blooming girl of a florid complexion and vigorous health, with a tendency to robustness, of which she was painfully conscious, and which, with little regard to hygienic principles, she endeavored to suppress or conceal, thereby preparing for herself much future suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>With no pretensions to beauty then, or at any time, her face was <num value="1">one</num> that attracted, that awakened a lively interest, that made <num value="1">one</num> desirous of a nearer acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>It was a face that fascinated, without satisfying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Never seen in repose, never allowing a steady perusal of its features, it baffled every attempt to judge the character by physiognomical induction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>You saw the evidence of a mighty force, but what direction that force would assume,&mdash;whether it would determine itself to social triumphs, or to triumphs of art,&mdash;it was impossible to divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Her moral tendencies, her sentiments, her true and prevailing character, did not appear in the lines of her face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>She seemed equal to anything, but might not choose to put forth her strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>You felt that a great possibility lay behind that brow, but you felt, also, that the talent <pb id="p.1092" n="1092"/> that was in her might miscarry through indifference or caprice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>I said she had no pretensions to beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Yet she was not plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>She escaped the reproach of positive plainness, by her blond and abundant hair, by her excellent teeth, by her sparkling, dancing, busy eyes, which, though usually half closed from nearsightedness, shot piercing glances at those with whom she conversed, and, most of all, by the very peculiar and graceful carriage of her head and neck, which all who knew her will remember as the most characteristic trait in her personal appearance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>In conversation she had already, at that early age, begun to distinguish herself, and made much the same impression in society that she did in after years, with the exception, that, as she advanced in life, she learned to control that tendency to sarcasm,&mdash;that disposition to <quote>quiz,</quote> &ndash;which was then somewhat excessive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>It frightened shy young people from her presence, and made her, for a while, notoriously unpopular with the ladies of her circle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>This propensity seems to have been aggravated by unpleasant encounters in her school-girl experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>She was a pupil of <persName n="Park,Doctor,,,," id="n0234.0002.01092.00115" reg="mostcommon:Park,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Park</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, whose seminary for young ladies was then at the height of a well-earned reputation, and whose faithful and successful endeavors in this department have done much to raise the standard of female education among us. Here the inexperienced country girl was exposed to petty persecutions from the dashing misses of the city, who pleased themselves with giggling criticisms not inaudible, nor meant to be inaudible to their subject, on whatsoever in dress and manner fell short of the city mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/><pb id="p.1093" n="1093"/> Then it was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> revealed to her young heart, and laid up for future reflection, how large a place in woman's world is given to fashion and frivolity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Her mind reacted on these attacks with indiscriminate sarcasms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>She made herself formidable by her wit, and, of course, unpopular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>A root of bitterness sprung up in her which ears of moral culture were needed to eradicate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Partly to evade the temporary unpopularity into which she had fallen, and partly to pursue her studies secure from those social avocations which were found unavoidable in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct> or <num value="5">5</num> she was sent to <placeName key="tgn,2049856" n="1.000 4" reg="groton, middlesex, massachusetts">Groton</placeName>, where she remained <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> in quiet seclusion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>On her return to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></dateStruct>, I renewed my acquaintance, and an intimacy was then formed, which continued until her death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>The next <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, which were spent in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, were years of steady growth, with little variety of incident, and little that was noteworthy of outward experience, but with great intensity of the inner life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>It was with her, as with most young women, and with most young men, too, between the ages of <num value="16">sixteen</num> and <num value="25">twenty-five</num>, a period of preponderating sentimentality, a period of romance and of dreams, of yearning and of passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>She pursued at this time, I think, no systematic study, but she read with the heart, and was learning more from social experience than from books.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>I remember noting at this time a trait which continued to be a prominent <num value="1">one</num> through life,&mdash;I mean a passionate love for the beautiful, which comprehended all the kingdoms of nature and art. I have never known <num value="1">one</num> who seemed to derive such satisfaction from the contemplation of lovely forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/><pb id="p.1094" n="1094"/></p> 
<p>Her intercourse with girls of her own age and standing was frank and excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>Personal attractions, and the homage which they received, awakened in her no jealousy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>She envied not their success, though vividly aware of the worth of beauty, and inclined to exaggerate her own deficiencies in that kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>On the contrary, she loved to draw these fair girls to herself, and to make them her guests, and was never so happy as when surrounded, in company, with such a bevy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>This attraction was mutual, as, according to <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01094.00116" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, every attraction is. Where she felt an interest, she awakened an interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>Without flattery or art, by the truth and nobleness of her nature, she won the confidence, and made herself the friend and intimate, of a large number of young ladies,&mdash;the belles of their day, &mdash;with most of whom she remained in correspondence luring the greater part of her life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>In our evening reunions she was always conspicuous by the brilliancy of her wit, which needed but little provocation to break forth in exuberant sallies, that drew around her a knot of listeners, and made her the central attraction of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>Rarely did she enter a company in which she was not a prominent object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>I have spoken of her conversational talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>It continued to develop itself in these years, and was certainly her most decided gift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/><num value="1">One</num> could form no adequate idea of her ability without hearing her converse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>She did many things well, but nothing so well as she talked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>It is the opinion of all her friends, that her writings do her very imperfect justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>For some reason or other, she could never deliver herself in print as she did with her lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>She required the stimulus of attentive ears <pb id="p.1095" n="1095"/> and answering eyes, to bring out all her power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>She must have her auditory about her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Her conversation, as it was then, I have seldom heard equalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>It was not so much attractive as commanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Though remarkably fluent and select, it was neither fluency, nor choice diction, nor wit, nor sentiment, that gave it its peculiar power, but accuracy of statement, keen discrimination, and a certain weight of judgment, which contrasted strongly and charmingly with the youth and sex of the speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>I do not remember that the vulgar charge of talking <quote>like a book</quote> was ever fastened upon her, although, by her precision, she might seem to have incurred it. The fact was, her speech, though finished and true as the most deliberate rhetoric of the pen, had always an air of spontaneity which made it seem the grace of the moment,&mdash;the result of some organic provision that made finished sentences as natural to her as blundering and hesitation are to most of us. With a little more imagination, she would have made an excellent improvisatrice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>Here let me say a word respecting the character of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>It was what in woman is generally called a masculine mind; that is, its action was determined by ideas rather than by sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>And yet, with this masculine trait, she combined a woman's appreciation of the beautiful in sentiment and the beautiful in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Her intellect was rather solid than graceful, yet no <num value="1">one</num> was more alive to grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>She was no artist,&mdash;she would never have written an epic, or romance, or drama,&mdash; yet no <num value="1">one</num> knew better the qualities which go to the making of these; and though catholic as to kind, no <num value="1">one</num> was more rigorously exacting as to quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>Nothing short of the best in each kind would content her. <pb id="p.1096" n="1096"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>She wanted imagination, and she wanted productiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>She wrote with difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Without external pressure, perhaps, she would never have written at all. She was dogmatic, and not creative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>Her strength was in characterization and in criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>Her <hi rend="italics">critique</hi> on <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01096.00117" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> volume of the <name>Dial</name>, is, in my estimation, <num value="1">one</num> of the best things she has written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>And, as far as it goes, it is <num value="1">one</num> of the best criticisms extant of <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01096.00118" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>What I especially admired in her was her intellectual sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>Her judgments took no bribe from her sex or her sphere, nor from custom nor tradition, nor caprice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>She valued truth supremely, both for herself and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>The question with her was not what should be believed, or what ought to be true, but what <hi rend="italics">is</hi> true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Her yes and no were never conventional; and she often amazed people by a cool and unexpected dissent from the commonplaces of popular acceptation.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, we have said, saw in each of her friends the secret interior capability, which might become hereafter developed into some special beauty or power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>By means of this penetrating, this prophetic insight, she gave each to himself, acted on each to draw out his best nature, gave him an ideal out of which he could draw strength and liberty hour by hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Thus her influence was ever ennobling, and each felt that in her society he was truer, wiser, better, and yet more free and happy, than elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>The <q direct="unspecified">dry light</q> which <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Bacon</foreName></persName> loved, she never knew; her light was life, was love, was warm with sympathy and a boundless energy of affection and hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Though her love flattered and charmed her <pb id="p.1097" n="1097"/> friends, it did not spoil them, for they knew her perfect truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>They knew that she loved them, not for what she imagined, but for what she saw, though she saw it only in the germ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>But as the <name>Greeks</name> beheld a Persephone and Athene in the passing stranger, and ennobled humanity into ideal beauty, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> saw all her friends thus idealized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>She was a balloon of sufficient power to take us all up with her into the serene depth of heaven, where she loved to float, far above the low details of earthly life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Earth lay beneath us as a lovely picture,&mdash;its sounds came up mellowed into music.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was, to persons younger than herself, a Makaria and Natalia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>She was wisdom and intellectual beauty, filling life with a charm and glory <q direct="unspecified">known to neither sea nor land.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>To those of her own age she was sibyl and seer,&mdash;a prophetess, revealing the future, pointing the path, opening their eyes to the great aims only worthy of pursuit in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>To those older than herself she was like the <name>Euphorion</name> in <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01097.00119" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>'s drama, child of <persName n="Faust,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01097.00120" reg="mostcommon:Faust,nomatch:0"><surname>Faust</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>Helen</foreName></persName>,&mdash;a wonderful union of exuberance and judgment, born of romantic fulness and classic limitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>They saw with surprise her clear good-sense balancing her flow of sentiment and ardent courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>They saw her comprehension of both sides of every question, and gave her their confidence, as to <num value="1">one</num> of equal age, because of so ripe a judgment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>But it was curious to see with what care and conscience she kept her friendships distinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>Her fine practical understanding, teaching her always the value of limits, enabled her to hold apart all her intimacies, nor did <num value="1">one</num> ever encroach on the province of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>Like a moral <persName n="Paganini,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01097.00121" reg="mostcommon:Paganini,nomatch:0"><surname>Paganini</surname></persName>, she played always on a single string, drawing from each its peculiar music,&mdash;bringing wild beauty from the slender <pb id="p.1098" n="1098"/> wire, no less than from the deep-sounding harp string Some of her friends had little to give her when compared with others; but I never noticed that she sacrificed in any respect the smaller faculty to the greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>She fully realized that the <rs>Divine Being</rs> makes each part of this creation divine, and that He dwells in the blade of grass as really if not as fully as in the majestic oak which has braved the storm for a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Your letter was of cordial sweetness to me, as is ever the thought of our friendship,&mdash;that sober-suited friendship, of which the web was so deliberately and well woven, and which wears so well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>I want words to express the singularity of all my past relations; yet let me try.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>From a very early age I have felt that I was not born to the common womanly lot. I knew I should never find a being who could keep the key of my character; that there would be none on whom I could <pb id="p.1099" n="1099"/> always lean, from whom I could always learn; that I should be a pilgrim and sojourner on earth, and that the birds and foxes would be surer of a place to lay the head than I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>You understand me, of course; such beings can only find their homes in hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>All material luxuries, all the arrangements of society, are mere conveniences to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>This thought, all whose bearings I did not, indeed, understand, affected me sometimes with sadness, sometimes with pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>I mourned that I never should have a thorough experience of life, never know the full riches of my being; I was proud that I was to test myself in the sternest way, that I was always to return to myself, to be my own priest, pupil, parent, child, husband, and wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>All this I did not understand as I do now; but this destiny of the thinker, and (shall I dare to say it?) of the poetic priestess, sibylline, dwelling in the cave, or amid the <name>Lybian</name> sands, lay yet enfolded in my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Accordingly, I did not look on any of the persons, brought into relation with me, with common womanly eyes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Yet, as my character is, after all, still more feminine than masculine, it would sometimes happen that I put more emotion into a state than I myself knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>I really was capable of attachment, though it never seemed so till the hour of separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>And if a connexion was torn up by the roots, the soil of my existence showed an unsightly wound, which long refused to clothe itself in verdure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>With regard to yourself, I was to you all that I wished to be. I knew that I reigned in your thoughts in my own way. And I also lived with you more truly and freely than with any other person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>We were <pb id="p.1100" n="1100"/> truly friends, but it was not friends as men are friends to <num value="1">one</num> another, or as brother and sister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>There was, also, that pleasure, which may, perhaps, be termed conjugal, of finding oneself in an alien nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Is there any tinge of love in this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Possibly! At least, in comparing it with my relation to&mdash;&mdash;, I find <hi rend="italics">that</hi> was strictly fraternal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>I valued him for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>I did not care for an influence over him, and was perfectly willing to have <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> rivals in his heart. * *</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>* * I think I may say, I never loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>I but see my possible life reflected on the clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>As in a glass darkly, I have seen what I might feel as child, wife, mother, but I have never really approached the close relations of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>A sister I have truly been to many,&mdash; a brother to more,&mdash;a fostering nurse to, oh how many!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>The bridal hour of many a spirit, when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it was wed, I have shared, but said adieu before the wine was poured out at the banquet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>And there is <num value="1">one</num> I always love in my poetic hour, as the lily looks up to the star from amid the waters; and another whom I visit as the bee visits the flower, when I crave sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>Yet those who live would scarcely consider that I am among the living,&mdash;and I am isolated, as you say.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>My dear&mdash;&mdash;, all is well; all has helped me to decipher the great poem of the universe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>I can hardly describe to you the happiness which floods my solitary hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>My actual life is yet much clogged and impeded, but I have at last got me an oratory, where I can retire and pray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>With your letter, vanished a last regret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>You did not act or think unworthily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>It is enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>As to the cessation of our confidential intercourse, circumstances must have accomplished that long ago; my only grief was that you should do it <pb id="p.1101" n="1101"/> with your own free will, and for reasons that I thought unworthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> knew <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, she was much in society, but in a circle of her own,&mdash;of friends whom she had drawn around her, and whom she entertained and delighted by her exuberant talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Of those belonging to this circle, let me recall a few characters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>The young girls whom <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> had attracted were very different from herself, and from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>From <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, <placeName reg="Roxbury, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015002">Roxbury</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013458" n="1.000 35" reg="brookline, norfolk county, massachusetts">Brookline</placeName>, they came to her, and the little circle of companions would meet now <pb id="p.1103" n="1103"/> in <num value="1">one</num> house, and now in another, of these pleasant towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>There was A&mdash;&mdash;, a dark-hai<rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">black</rs>-eyed beauty, with clear olive complexion, through which the rich blood flowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>She was bright, beauteous, and cold as a gem,&mdash;with clear perceptions of character within a narrow limit,&mdash;enjoying society, and always surrounded with admirers, of whose feelings she seemed quite unconscious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>While they were just ready to die of unrequited love, she stood untouched as <persName n="Artemis,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01103.00127" reg="mostcommon:Artemis,nomatch:0"><surname>Artemis</surname></persName>, scarcely aware of the deadly arrows which had flown from her silver bow. I remember that <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> said, that <persName n="Tennyson,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01103.00128" reg="mostcommon:Tennyson,nomatch:0"><surname>Tennyson</surname></persName>'s little poem of the skipping-rope must have been written for her,&mdash;where the lover expressing his admiration of the fairy-like motion and the light grace of the lady, is told&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/></p><l>Get off, or else my skipping-rope</l> <l>Will hit you in the eye.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Then there was B&mdash;&mdash;, the reverse of all this,&mdash;tender, susceptible, with soft blue eyes, and mouth of trembling sensibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>How sweet were her songs, in which a single strain of pure feeling ever reminded me of those angel symphonies,&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/></p><l>In all whose music, the pathetic minor Our ears will cross&mdash;</l></quote> and when she sang or spoke, her eyes had often the expression of <num value="1">one</num> looking <hi rend="italics">in</hi> at her thought, not <hi rend="italics">out</hi> at her companion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Then there was C&mdash;&mdash;, all animated and radiant with joyful interest in life,&mdash;seeing with ready eye the beauty of Nature and of Thought,&mdash;entering with quick sympathy <pb id="p.1104" n="1104"/> into all human interest, taking readily everything which belonged to her, and dropping with sure instinct whatever suited her not. Unknown to her was struggle, conflict, crisis; she grew up harmonious as the flower, drawing nutriment from earth and air,&mdash;from <q direct="unspecified">common things which round us lie,</q> and equally from the highest thoughts and inspirations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>Shall I also speak of D&mdash;&mdash;, whose beauty had a halfvoluptuous character, from those ripe red lips, those ringlets overflowing the well-rounded shoulders, and the hazy softness of those large eyes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Or of E&mdash;&mdash;, her companion, beautiful too, but in a calmer, purer style,&mdash;with eye from which looked forth selfposses-sion, truth and fortitude?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>Others, well worth notice, I must not notice now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>But among the young men who surrounded <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, a like variety prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/><num value="1">One</num> was to her interesting, on account of his quick, active intellect, and his contempt for shows and pretences; for his inexhaustible wit, his exquisite taste, his infinitely varied stores of information, and the poetic view which he took of life, painting it with Rembrandt depths of shadow and bursts of light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>Another she gladly went to for his compact, thoroughly considered views of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the world,&mdash;for his culture, so much more deep and rich than any other we could find here,&mdash;for his conversation, opening in systematic form new fields of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>Yet men of strong native talent, and rich character, she also liked well to know, however deficient in culture, knowledge, or power of utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>Each was to her a study, and she never rested till she had found the bottom of every mind,&mdash; till she had satisfied herself of its capacity and currents,&mdash; measuring it with her sure line, as <pb id="p.1105" n="1105"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/></p><l part="F">All human wits</l> <l>Are measured, but a few.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>It was by her singular gift of speech that she cast her spells and worked her wonders in this little circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>Full of thoughts and full of words; capable of poetic improvisation, had there not been a slight overweight of a tendency to the tangible and real; capable of clear, complete, philosophic statement, but for the strong tendency to life which melted down evermore in its lavacurrent the solid blocks of thought; she was yet, by these excesses, better fitted for the arena of conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>Here she found none adequate for the equal encounter; when she laid her lance in rest, every champion must go down before it. How fluent her wit, which, for hour after hour, would furnish best entertainment, as she described scenes where she had lately been, or persons she had lately seen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>Yet she readily changed from gay to grave, and loved better the serious talk which opened the depths of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>Describing a conversation in relation to Christianity, with a friend of strong mind, who told her he had found, in this religion, a home for his best and deepest thoughts, she says&mdash;<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>Ah! what a pleasure to meet with such a daring, yet realizing, mind as his!</p></quote> But her catholic taste found satisfaction in intercourse with persons quite different from herself in opinions and tendencies, as the following letter, written in her <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> year, will indicate: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>I was very happy, although greatly restrained by the apprehension of going a little too far with these persons of singular refinement and settled opinions <pb id="p.1106" n="1106"/> However, I believe I did pretty well, though I did make <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> little mistakes, when most interested; but I was not so foolish as to try to retrieve them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/><num value="1">One</num> occasion more particularly, when <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G&mdash;&mdash;, after going more fully into his poetical opinions than I could have expected, stated his sentiments: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that <persName n="Wordsworth,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01106.00129" reg="mostcommon:Wordsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wordsworth</surname></persName> had, in truth, guided, or, rather, completely vivified the poetry of this age; secondly, that &apos;t was his influence which had, in reality, given all his better individuality to <persName n="Byron,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01106.00130" reg="mostcommon:Byron,nomatch:0"><surname>Byron</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>He recurred again and again to this opinion, <hi rend="italics">con amore</hi>, and seemed to wish much for an answer; but I would not venture, though &apos;t was hard for me to forbear, I knew so well what I thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G&mdash;&mdash;&apos;s Wordsworthianism, however, is excellent; his beautiful simplicity of taste, and love of truth, have preserved him from any touch of that vague and imbecile enthusiasm, which has enervated almost all the exclusive and determined admirers of the great poet whom I have known in these parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>His reverence, his feeling, are thoroughly intelligent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>Everything in his mind is well defined; and his horror of the vague, and false, nay, even (suppose another horror here, for grammar's sake) of the startling and paradoxical, have their beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>I think I could know Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; long, and see him perpetually, without any touch of satiety; such variety is made by the very absence of pretension, and the love of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>I found much amusement in leading him to sketch the scenes and persons which <persName n="Lockhart,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01106.00131" reg="mostcommon:Lockhart,nomatch:0"><surname>Lockhart</surname></persName> portrays in such glowing colors, and which he, too, has seen with the <hi rend="italics">eye of taste</hi>, but how different!</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>Our friend was well aware that her <hi rend="italics">forte</hi> was in conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>Here she felt at home, here she felt her <pb id="p.1107" n="1107"/> power, and the excitement which the presence of living persons brought, gave all her faculties full activity <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>After all,</p></quote> she says, in a letter, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>Conversation is my natural element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>Whether this be nature or the force of circumstances, I know not; it is my habit, and bespeaks a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-rate mind.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>I am disposed to think, much as she excelled in general conversation, that her greatest mental efforts were made n intercourse with individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>All her friends will unite in the testimony, that whatever they may have known of wit and eloquence in others, they have never seen <num value="1">one</num> who, like her, by the conversation of an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, could not merely entertain and inform, but make an epoch in <num value="1">one</num>'s life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>We all dated back to this or that conversation with <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, in which we took a complete survey of great subjects, came to some clear view of a difficult question, saw our way open before us to a higher plane of life, and were led to some definite resolution or purpose which has had a bearing on all our subsequent career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>For <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s conversation turned, at such times, to life,&mdash; its destiny, its duty, its prospect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>With comprehensive glance she would survey the past, and sum up, in a few brief words, its results; she would then turn to the future, and, by a natural order, sweep <pb id="p.1108" n="1108"/> through its chances and alternatives,&mdash;passing ever into a more earnest tone, into a more serious view,&mdash;and then bring all to bear on the present, till its duties grew plain, and its opportunities attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Happy he who can lift conversation, without loss of its cheer, to the highest uses!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Happy he who has such a gift as this, an original faculty thus accomplished by culture, by which he can make our common life rich, significant and fair,&mdash; can give to the hour a beauty and brilliancy which shall make it eminent long after, amid dreary years of level routine!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>I recall many such conversations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> summer's day, in which we rode together, on horseback, from <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> to <persName n="Newton,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01108.00132" reg="mostcommon:Newton,nomatch:0"><surname>Newton</surname></persName>,&mdash;a day all of a piece, in which my eloquent companion helped me to understand my past life, and her own,&mdash;a day which left me in that calm repose which comes to us, when we clearly apprehend what we ought to do, and are ready to attempt it. I recall other mornings when, not having seen her for a week or <num value="2">two</num>, I would walk with her for hours, beneath the lindens or in the garden, while we related to each other what we had read in our <name>German</name> studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>And I always left her astonished at the progress of her mind, at the amount of new thoughts she had garnered, and tilled with a new sense of the worth of knowledge, and the value of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>There were other conversations, in which, impelled by the strong instinct of utterance, she would state, in words of tragical pathos, her own needs and longings,&mdash; her demands on life,&mdash;the struggles of mind, and of heart,&mdash;her conflicts with self, with nature, with the limitations of circumstances, with insoluble problems, with an unattainable desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>She seemed to <pb id="p.1109" n="1109"/> feel relief from the expression of these thoughts, though she gained no light from her companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>Many such conversations I remember, while she lived in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and <num value="1">one</num> such in <placeName key="tgn,2049856" n="1.000 4" reg="groton, middlesex, massachusetts">Groton</placeName>; but afterwards, when I met her, I found her mind risen above these struggles, and in a self-possessed state which needed no such outlet for its ferment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>It is impossible to give any account of <hi rend="italics">these</hi> conversations; but I add a few scraps, to indicate, however slightly, something of her ordinary manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>This aim was distinctly apprehended and steadily pursued by her from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>It was a high, noble <num value="1">one</num>, wholly religious, almost <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01132.00207" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>It gave dignity to her whole career, and made it heroic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>This aim, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, was self-culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>If she ever was ambitious of knowledge and talent, as a means of excelling others, and gaining fame, position, admiration,&mdash;this vanity had passed before I knew her, and was replaced by the profound desire for a full development of her whole nature, by means of a full experience of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>In her description of her own youth, she says, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>They, no doubt, injured those who accepted the husks they proffered for bread, and believed that exercise of memory was study, and to know what others knew, was the object of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>But to me this was all penetrable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>I had known great living minds,&mdash;I had seen <pb id="p.1133" n="1133"/> how they took their food and did their exercise, and what their objects were.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>In this she spoke truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>The good and the evil which flow from this great idea of self-development she fully realized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>This aim of life, originally self-chosen, was made much more clear to her mind by the study of <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0002.01133.00208" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, the great master of this school, in whose unequalled eloquence this doctrine acquires an almost irresistible beauty and charm.</p>

It was religious, because it recognized something divine, infinite, imperishable in the human soul,&mdash; something divine in outward nature and providence, by which the soul is led along its appointed way. It was almost Christian in its superiority to all low, worldly, vulgar thoughts and cares; in its recognition of a high standard of duty, and a great destiny for man. In its strength, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was enabled to do and bear, with patient fortitude, what would have crushed a soul not thus supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>Yet it is not the highest aim, for in all its forms, whether as personal improvement, the salvation of the soul, or ascetic religion, it has at its core a profound selfishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s soul was too generous for any low form of selfishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>Too noble to become an Epicurean, too large-minded to become a modern ascetic, the defective nature of her rule of life, showed itself in <pb id="p.1134" n="1134"/> her case, only in a certain supercilious tone toward <q direct="unspecified">the vulgar herd,</q> in the absence (at this period) of a tender humanity, and in an idolatrous hero-worship of genius and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>Afterward, too, she may have suffered from her desire for a universal human experience, and an unwillingness to see that we must often be content to enter the <name>Kingdom</name> of Heaven halt and maimed, &mdash;that a perfect development here must often be wholly renounced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>But how much better to pursue with devotion, like that of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, an imperfect aim, than to worship with lip-service, as most persons do, even though it be in a loftier temple, and before a holier shrine!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>With <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, the doctrine of self-culture was a devotion to which she sacrificed all earthly hopes and joys,&mdash;everything but manifest duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>Before this time, however, during her residence at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, she seemed to reach the period of her existence in which she descended lowest into the depths of gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>She felt keenly, at this time, the want of a home for her heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>Full of a profound tendency toward life, capable of an ardent love, her affections were thrown back on her heart, to become stagnant, and for a while to grow bitter there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>Then it was that she felt how empty and worthless were all the attainments and triumphs of the mere intellect; then it was that <q direct="unspecified">she went <pb id="p.1139" n="1139"/> about to cause her heart to despair of all the labor she had taken under the sun.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>Had she not emerged from this valley of the shadow of death, and come on to a higher plane of conviction and hope, her life would have been a most painful tragedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>But, when we know how she passed on and up, ever higher and higher, to the mountain-top, leaving <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> these dark ravines and mist-shrouded valleys, and ascending to where a perpetual sunshine lay, above the region of clouds, and was able to overlook with eagle glance the widest panorama,&mdash;we can read, with sympathy indeed, but without pain, the following extracts from a journal:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>It was Thanksgiving day, (<dateStruct value="1831-11-"><month reg="11">Nov.</month>, <year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>,) and I was obliged to go to church, or exceedingly displease my father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>I almost always suffered much in church from a feeling of disunion with the hearers and dissent from the preacher; but to-day, more than ever before, the services jarred upon me from their grateful and joyful tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>I was wearied out with mental conflicts, and in a mood of most childish, child-like sadness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>I felt within myself great power, and generosity, and tenderness; but it seemed to me as if they were all unrecognized, and as if it was impossible that they should be used in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>I was only <num value="1">one</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>; the past was worthless, the future hopeless; yet I could not remember ever voluntarily to have done a wrong thing, and my aspiration seemed very high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>I looked round the church, and envied all the little children; for I supposed they had parents who protected them, so that they could never know this strange anguish, this dread uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>I knew not, then, that none could have any father but <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>I knew not, that I was not the <pb id="p.1140" n="1140"/> only lonely <num value="1">one</num>, that I was not the selected (Edipus, the special victim of an iron law. I was in haste for all to be over, that I might get into the free air.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>I walked away over the fields as fast as I could walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>This was my custom at that time, when I could no longer bear the weight of my feelings, and fix my attention on any pursuit; for I do believe I never voluntarily gave way to these thoughts <num value="1">one</num> moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>The force I exerted I think, even now, greater than I ever knew in any other character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>But when I could bear myself no longer, I walked many hours, till the anguish was wearied out, and I returned in a state of prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>Today all seemed to have reached its height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>It seemed as if I could never return to a world in which I had no place,&mdash;to the mockery of humanities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>I could not act a part, nor seem to live any longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>It was a sad and sallow day of the late autumn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>Slow processions of sad clouds were passing over a cold blue sky; the hues of earth were dull, and gray, and brown, with sickly struggles of late green here and there; sometimes a moaning gust of wind drove late, reluctant leaves across the path;&mdash;there was no life else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>In the sweetness of my present peace, such days seem to me made to tell man the worst of his lot; but still that <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> wind can bring a chill of memory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>I paused beside a little stream, which I had envied in the merry fulness of its spring life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>It was shrunken, voiceless, choked with withered leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>I marvelled that it did not quite lose itself in the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>There was no stay for me, and I went on and on, till I came to where the trees were thick about a little pool, dark and silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>I sat down there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>I did not think; all was dark, and cold, and still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>Suddenly the sun shone out <pb id="p.1141" n="1141"/> with that transparent sweetness, like the last smile of a dying lover, which it will use when it has been unkind all a cold autumn day. And, even then, passed into my thought a beam from its true sun, from its native sphere, which has never since departed from me. I remembered how, a little child, I had stopped myself <num value="1">one</num> day on the stairs, and asked, how came I here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>How is it that I seem to be this <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0234.0002.01141.00211" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>What does it mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>What shall I do about it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>I remembered all the times and ways in which the same thought had returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>I saw how long it must be before the soul can learn to act under these limitations of time and space, and human nature; but I saw, also, that it must do it,&mdash;that it must make all this false true,&mdash;and sow new and immortal plants in the garden of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, before it could return again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>I saw there was no self; that selfishness was all folly, and the result of circumstance; that it was only because I thought self real that I suffered; that I had only to live in the idea of the all, and all was mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>This truth came to me, and I received it unhesitatingly; so that I was for that hour taken up into <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>In that true ray most of the relations of earth seemed mere films, phenomena.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>My earthly pain at not being recognized never went deep after this hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>I had passed the extreme of passionate sorrow; and all check, all failure, all ignorance, have seemed temporary ever since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>When I consider that this will be <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> ago next <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, I am astonished that I have not gone on faster since; that I am not yet sufficiently purified to be taken back to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>Still, I did but touch then on the only haven of Insight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>You know what I would say. I was dwelling in the ineffable, the unutterable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>But the sun of earth set, and <pb id="p.1142" n="1142"/> it grew dark around; the moment came for me to go. I had never been accustomed to walk alone at night, for my father was very strict on that subject, but now I had not <num value="1">one</num> fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>When I came back, the moon was riding clear above the houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>I went into the churchyard, and there offered a prayer as holy, if not as deeply true, as any I know now; a prayer, which perhaps took form as the guardian angel of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>If that word in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, <placeName reg="Selah, Marion, Oregon" key="tgn,2651961">Selah</placeName>, means what gray-headed old men think it does, when they read aloud, it should be written here,&mdash;Selah!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>Since that day, I have never more been completely engaged in self; but the statue has been emerging, though slowly, from the block.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>Others may not see the promise even of its pure symmetry, but I do, and am learning to be patient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>I shall be all human yet; and then the hour will come to leave humanity, and live always in the pure ray.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>This <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day I was taken up; but the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs> descended like a dove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>I went out again for a day, but this time it was spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>I walked in the fields of <placeName key="tgn,2049856" n="1.000 4" reg="groton, middlesex, massachusetts">Groton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>But I will not describe that day; its music still sounds too sweetly near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>Suffice it to say, I gave it all into our <rs type="role2">Father</rs>'s hands, and was no stern-weaving Fate more, but <num value="1">one</num> elected to obey, and love, and at last know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>Since then I have suffered, as I must suffer again, till all the complex be made simple, but I have never been in discord with the grand harmony.</p></quote> </p></div2></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>I still remember the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>hour of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>She was then twentysix years old. She had a face and frame that would indicate fulness and tenacity of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>She was rather under the middle height; her complexion was fair, with strong fair hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>She was then, as always, carefully and becomingly dressed, and of ladylike self-possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>For the rest, her appearance had nothing prepossessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>Her extreme plainness,&mdash;a trick of incessantly opening and shutting her eyelids,&mdash;the nasal tone of her voice,&mdash; all repelled; and I said to myself, we shall never get far.

This was partly the effect of her manners, which expressed an overweening sense of power, and slight esteem of others, and partly the prejudice of her fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>She had a dangerous reputation for satire, in addition to her great scholarship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>The men thought she carried too many guns, and the women did not like <num value="1">one</num> who despised them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>I believe I fancied her too much interested in personal history; and her talk was a comedy in which dramatic justice was done to everybody's foibles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>I remember that she made me laugh more than I liked; for I was, at that time, an eager scholar of ethics, and had tasted the sweets of solitude and stoicism, and I found something profane in the hours of amusing gossip into which she drew me, and, when I returned to my library, had much to think of the crackling of thorns under a pot. <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, who had stuffed me out as a philosopher, in her own fancy, was too intent on establishing a good footing between us, to omit any art of <pb id="p.1203" n="1203"/> winning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>She studied my tastes, piqued and amused me, challenged frankness by frankness, and did not conceal the good opinion of me she brought with her, nor her wish to please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>She was curious to know my opinions and experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>Of course, it was impossible long to hold out against such urgent assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>She had an incredible variety of anecdotes, and the readiest wit to give an absurd turn to whatever passed; and the eyes, which were so plain at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, soon swam with fun and drolleries, and the very tides of joy and superabundant life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>This rumor was much spread abroad, that she was sneering, scoffing, critical, disdainful of humble people, and of all but the intellectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>It was a superficial judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>Her satire was only the pastime and necessity of her talent, the play of superabundant animal spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>And it will be seen, in the sequel, that her mind presently disclosed many moods and powers, in successive platforms or terraces, each above each, that quite effaced this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression, in the opulence of the following pictures.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>Her father, whom she had recently lost, had been proud of her, and petted her.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>These histories are rapid, so that she had already beheld many times the youth, meridian, and old age of passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>She had, besides, selected, from so many, a few eminent companions, and already felt that she was not likely to see anything more beautiful than her beauties, anything more powerful and generous than her youths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>She had found out her own secret by early comparison, and knew what power to draw confidence, what necessity to lead in every circle, belonged of right to her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>She had outward calmness and dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>Her arrival was a holiday, and so was her abode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>In this reticence was no prudery and no effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>She soon became an established friend and frequent inmate of our house, and continued, thenceforward, for years, to come, once in <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, to spend a week or a fortnight with us. She adopted all the people and all the interests she found here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>Your people shall be my people, and yonder darling boy I shall cherish as my own. Her ready sympathies endeared her to my wife and my mother, each of whom highly esteemed her good sense and sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>She suited each, and all. Yet, she was not a person to be suspected of complaisance, and her attachments, <num value="1">one</num> might say, were chemical.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>She had so many tasks of her own, that she was a very easy guest to entertain, as she could be left to herself, day after day, without apology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>According to our usual habit, we seldom met in the forenoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>After dinner, we read something together, or walked; or rode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>In the evening, she came to the library, and many and many a conversation was there held, whose details, if they could be preserved, would justify all encomiums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>They interested me in every manner;&mdash;talent, memory, <pb id="p.1218" n="1218"/> wit, stern introspection, poetic play, religion, the finest personal feeling, the aspects of the future, each followed each in full activity, and left me, I remember, enriched and sometimes astonished by the gifts of my guest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>Her topics were numerous, but the cardinal points of poetry, love, and religion, were never far off. She was a student of art, and, though untravelled, knew, much better than most persons who had been abroad, the conventional reputation of each of the masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>She was familiar with all the field of elegant criticism in literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>Among the problems of the day, these <num value="2">two</num> attracted her chiefly, Mythology and Demonology; then, also, French Socialism, especially as it concerned woman; the whole prolific family of reforms, and, of course, the genius and career of each remarkable person.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>She had other friends, in this town, beside those in my house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/>Unhappily, her constitutional self-esteem sometimes blinded the eyes that should have seen that an idea lay at the bottom of some lives which she did not quite so readily comprehend as beauty; that truth had other manifestations than those which engaged her natural sympathies; that sometimes the soul illuminated <pb id="p.1239" n="1239"/> only the smallest arc&mdash;of a circle so large that it was lost in the clouds of another world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>This apology reminds me of a little speech once made to her, at his own house, by <persName n="Channing,Doctor,,,," id="n0234.0004.01239.00468" reg="mostcommon:Channing,W.,H.,,:3"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName>, who held her in the highest regard: <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Fuller,Miss,,,," id="n0234.0004.01239.00469" reg="mostcommon:Fuller,Margaret,,,:17"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, when I consider that you are and have all that <rs type="role2">Miss</rs>&mdash;&mdash;has so long wished for, and that you scorn her, and that she still admires you,&mdash;I think her place in heaven will be very high.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>This is the truly beautiful, the ideal <rs>Byron</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>This head is quite free from the got-up, caricatured air of disdain, which disfigures most likenesses of him, as it did himself in real life; yet sultry, stern, all-craving, all-commanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>Even the heavy style of the hair, too closely curled for grace, is favorable to the <pb id="p.1269" n="1269"/> expression of concentrated life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>A head must be of a style either very stern or very chaste, to make a deep impression on the beholder; there must be a great force of will and withholding of resources, giving a sense of depth below depth, which we call sternness; or else there must be that purity, flowing as from an inexhaustible fountain through every lineament, which drives far off or converts all baser natures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/><placeName reg="Napoleon's head">Napoleon's head</placeName> is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> description; it is stern, and not only so, but ruthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>Yet this ruthlessness excites no aversion; the artist has caught its true character, and given us here the <name>Attila</name>, the instrument of fate to serve a purpose not his own.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>Yet, even near the <name>Ennius</name> and <name>Napoleon</name>, our American men look worthy to be perpetuated in marble or bronze, if it were only for their air of calm, unpretending sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>If the young <rs>American</rs> were to walk up an avenue lined with such effigies, he might not feel called to such greatness as the strong <name>Roman</name> wrinkles tell of, but he must feel that he could not live an idle life, and should nerve himself to lift an Atlas weight without repining or shrinking.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/>It has the freshness of the woods, and of morning dew. I admire those long lithe limbs, and that column of a throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>The <rs>Diana</rs> is a woman's ideal of beauty; its elegance, its spirit, its graceful, peremptory air, are what we like in our own sex: the <rs>Venus</rs> is for men. The sleeping <rs>Cleopatra</rs> cannot be looked at enough; always her sleep seems sweeter and more graceful, always more wonderful the drapery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>A little <persName n="Psyche,,,,," id="n0234.0004.01271.00615" reg="mostcommon:Psyche,nomatch:0"><surname>Psyche</surname></persName>, by a pupil of <persName n="Bartolini,,,,," id="n0234.0004.01271.00616" reg="mostcommon:Bartolini,nomatch:0"><surname>Bartolini</surname></persName>, pleases us much thus far.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>The Mercury and Ganymede with the <rs>Eagle</rs>, by <persName n="Thorwaldsen,,,,," id="n0234.0004.01271.00617" reg="mostcommon:Thorwaldsen,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorwaldsen</surname></persName>, are still as fine as on <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>Her adjuncts are admirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>The elder figure, in the lowest pannel,&mdash;with what eyes of deep experience, and still unquenched enthusiasm, he sits meditating on the past!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>The figures at top are fiery with genius, especially the melancholy <num value="1">one</num>, worthy to lift any weight, if he did but know how to set about it. As it is, all his strength may be wasted, yet he no whit the less noble.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>But the <hi rend="italics">Persica</hi> is my favorite above all. She is the true sibyl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>All the grandeur of that wasted frame comes from within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>The life of thought has wasted the fresh juices of the body, and hardened the sere leaf of her cheek to parchment; every lineament is sharp, every tint tarnished; her face is seamed with wrinkles, &mdash;usually as repulsive on a woman's face as attractive on a man. We usually feel, on looking at a woman, as if Nature had given them their best dower, and Experience could prove little better than a step-dame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>But here, her high ambition and devotion to the life of thought gives her the masculine privilege of beauty in advancing years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>Read on, hermitess of the world!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>what thou seekest is not there, yet thou dost not seek in vain.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>The adjuncts to this figure are worthy of it. On the right, below, those <num value="2">two</num> divine sleepers, redeeming human nature, and infolding expectation in a robe of pearly sheen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>Here is the sweetness of strength,&mdash;honey to the valiant; on the other side, its awfulness,&mdash;meat to <pb id="p.1278" n="1278"/> the strong man. His sleep is more powerful than the waking of myriads of other men. What will he do when he has recruited his strength in this night's slumber?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>What wilt thou sing of it, wild-haired child of the lyre?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>I admire the heavy fall of the sleeper's luxuriant hair, which reminds <num value="1">one</num> of the final shutting down of night upon a sullen twilight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>The other figures, too, are full of augury, sad but life-like, in its poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>On the shield, how perfectly is the expression of being struck home to the heart given!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>I wish I could have that shield, in some shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>Only a single blow was needed; the hand was sure, the breast shrinking, but unresisting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>Die, child of my affection, child of my old age!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>Let the blood follow to the hilt, for it is the sword of the <rs>Lord</rs>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>In looking again, this shield is on the <hi rend="italics">Libica</hi>, and that of the <hi rend="italics">Persica</hi> represents conquest, not sacrifice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>Over all these figures broods the spirit of prophecy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>You see their sternest deed is under the theocratic form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>I fear the remark already made on that susceptibility to details in art and nature which precluded the exercise of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s sound catholic judgment, must be extended to more than her connoisseurship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>She <hi rend="italics">had</hi> a sound judgment, on which, in conversation, she could fall back, and anticipate and speak the best sense of the largest company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>But, left to herself, and in her correspondence, she was much the victim of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Bacon</foreName></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">idols of the cave</hi>, or self-deceived by her own phantasms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>I have looked over volumes of her letters to me and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>They are full of probity, talent, wit, friendship, charity, and high aspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>They are tainted with a mysticism, which to me appears so much an affair of constitution, that it claims no more respect than the charity or patriotism of a man who has dined well, and feels better for it. <num value="1">One</num> sometimes talks with a genial <hi rend="italics">bon vivant</hi>, who looks as if the omelet and turtle have got into his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>In our noble <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, her personal feeling colors all her judgment of persons, of books, of pictures, and even of the laws of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>This is easily felt in ordinary women, and a large deduction is civilly made on the spot by whosoever replies to their remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>But when the speaker has such brilliant talent and literature as <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, she gives so many fine names to these merely sensuous and subjective phantasms, that the hearer is long imposed upon, and thinks so precise and glittering nomenclature cannot be of mere <hi rend="italics">muscae volitantes</hi>, phoenixes of the fancy, but must be of some real ornithology, hitherto unknown to him. This mere feeling exaggerates a host of trifles into a dazzling mythology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>But when <num value="1">one</num> goes to sift it, and find if there be a real meaning, it eludes search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>Whole <pb id="p.1280" n="1280"/> sheets of warm, florid writing are here, in which the eye is caught by <q direct="unspecified">sapphire,</q> <q direct="unspecified">heliotrope,</q> <q direct="unspecified">dragon,</q> <q direct="unspecified">aloes,</q> <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Dea,,Magna,,," id="n0234.0004.01280.00637" reg="default:Dea,Magna,,,"><foreName>Magna</foreName> <surname>Dea</surname></persName>,</q> <q direct="unspecified">limboes,</q> <q direct="unspecified">stars,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">purgatory,</q> but can connect all this, or any part of it, with no universal experience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>In short, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> often loses herself in sentimentalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>That dangerous vertigo nature in her case adopted, and was to make respectable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>As it sometimes happens that a grandiose style, like that of the <rs>Alexandrian Platonists</rs>, or like Macpherson's Ossian, is more stimulating to the imagination of nations, than the true <rs>Plato</rs>, or than the simple poet, so here was a head so creative of new colors, of wonderful gleams,&mdash;so iridescent, that it piqued curiosity, and stimulated thought, and communicated mental activity to all who approached her; though her perceptions were not to be compared to her fancy, and she made numerous mistakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>Her integrity was perfect, and she was led and followed by love, and was really bent on truth, but too indulgent to the meteors of her fancy.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>It seemed, her magnanimity was not met, but I prized her only for the thoughts and pictures she brought me;&mdash;so many thoughts, so many facts yesterday,&mdash;so many to-day;&mdash; when there was an end of things to tell, the game was up: that, I did not know, as a friend should know, to prize a silence as much as a discourse,&mdash;and hence a forlorn feeling was inevitable; a poor counting of thoughts, and a taking the census of virtues, was the unjust reception so much love found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>The unfeeling sun shot pains into his temples; the burning air, <pb id="p.1290" n="1290"/> filled with sand, checked his breath; he had no water, and no fountain sprung along his path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>But when he reached it, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>On it he saw no clustering dates, and its <num value="1">one</num> draught of wine was far beyond his reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>He saw at once that it was so. A child, a bird, a monkey, might have climbed to reach it. A rude hand might have felled the whole tree; but the full-grown man, the weary man, the gentle-hearted, religious man, was no nearer to its nourishment for being close to the root; yet he had not force to drag himself further, and leave at once the aim of so many fond hopes, so many beautiful thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>So he lay down amid the inhospitable sands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>The night dews pierced his exhausted frame; the hyena laughed, the lion roared, in the distance; the stars smiled upon him satirically from their passionless peace; and he knew they were like the sun, as unfeeling, only more distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>He could not sleep for famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>With the dawn he arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>The palm stood as tall, as inaccessible, as ever; its leaves did not so much as rustle an answer to his farewell sigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>On and on he went, and came, at last, to a living spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>The spring was encircled by tender verdure, wild fruits ripened near, and the clear waters sparkled up to tempt his lip. The pilgrim rested, and refreshed himself, and looked back with less pain to the unsympathizing palm, which yet towered in the distance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3126"/> But the wanderer had a mission to perform, which <pb id="p.1291" n="1291"/> must have forced him to leave at last both palm and fountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3127"/>So on and on he went, saying to the palm, <q direct="unspecified">Thou art for another;</q> and to the gentle waters, <q direct="unspecified">I will return.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3128"/></p> 
<p>Not far distant was he when the sirocco came, and choked with sand the fountain, and uprooted the fruittrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>When years have passed, the waters will have forced themselves up again to light, and a new oasis will await a new wanderer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>Thou, Sohrab, wilt, ere that time, have left thy bones at <placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mecca</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>But she was formed for action, and addressed herself quite simply to her part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>She was a woman, an orphan, without beauty, without money; and these negatives will suggest what difficulties were to be surmounted where the tasks dictated by her talents required the good-will of <q direct="unspecified">good society,</q> in the town where she was to teach and write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>But she was even-tempered and erect, and, if her journals are sometimes mournful, her mind was made up, her countenance beamed courage and cheerfulness around her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>I read all this in the tone of uniform gratitude and love with which this lady is mentioned in <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>People do not speak the truth, not for the want of not knowing and preferring it, but because they have not the organ to speak it adequately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>It requires a clear sight, and, still more, a high spirit, to deal with falsehood in the decisive way. I have known several honest persons who valued truth as much as <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, but, when they tried to speak it, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> grew <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> in the face instead of <persName><foreName>Ananias</foreName></persName>, until, after a few attempts, they decided that aggressive truth was not their vocation, and confined themselves thenceforward to silent honesty, except on rare occasions, when either an extreme outrage, or a happier inspiration, loosened their tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>But a soul is now and then incarnated, whom indulgent nature has not afflicted with any cramp or frost, but who can speak the right word at the right moment, qualify the selfish and hypocritical act with its real name, and <pb id="p.1306" n="1306"/> without any loss of serenity, hold up the offence to the purest daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>Such a truth-speaker is worth more than the best police, and more than the laws or governors; for these do not always know their own side, but will back the crime for want of this very truth-speaker to expose them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>That is the theory of the newspaper,&mdash;to supersede official by intellectual influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>But, though the apostles establish the journal, it usually happens that, by some strange oversight, <persName><foreName>Ananias</foreName></persName> slips into the editor's chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>If, then, we could be provided with a fair proportion of truth-speakers, we could very materially and usefully contract the legislative and the executive functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>Others might abet a crime by silence, if they pleased; she chose to clear herself of all complicity, by calling the act by its name.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>It was curious to see the mysterious provocation which the mere presence of insight exerts in its neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>Like moths about a lamp, her victims voluntarily came to judgment: conscious persons, encumbered with egotism; vain persons, bent on concealing some mean vice; arrogant reformers, with some halting of their own; the <pb id="p.1307" n="1307"/> compromisers, who wished to reconcile right and wrong; &mdash;all came and held out their palms to the wise woman, to read their fortunes, and they were truly told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>I have alluded to the fact, that, in the summer of <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> underwent some change in the tone and the direction of her thoughts, to which she attributed a high importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>I remember, at an earlier period, when in earnest conversation with her, she seemed to have that height and daring, that I saw she was ready to do whatever she thought; and I observed that, with her literary riches, her invention and wit, her boundless fun and drollery, her light satire, and the most entertaining conversation in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, consisted a certain pathos of sentiment, and a march of character, threatening to arrive presently at the shores and plunge into the sea of Buddhism and mystical trances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>The literature of asceticism and rapturous piety was familiar to her. The conversation of certain mystics, who had appeared in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> about this time, had interested her, but in no commanding degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>But in this year, <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, in which events occurred which combined great happiness and pain for her affections, she remained for some time in a sort of ecstatic solitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>She made many attempts to describe her frame of mind to me, but did not inspire me with confidence that she had now come to any experiences that were profound or permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>She was vexed at the want of sympathy on my part, and I again <pb id="p.1309" n="1309"/> felt that this craving for sympathy did not prove the inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>There was a certain restlessness and fever, which I did not like should deceive a soul which was capable of greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>But jets of magnanimity were always natural to her; and her aspiring mind, eager for a higher and still a higher ground, made her gradually familiar with the range of the mystics, and, though never herself laid in the chamber called Peace, never quite authentically and originally speaking from the absolute or prophetic mount, yet she borrowed from her frequent visits to its precincts an occasional enthusiasm, which gave a religious dignity to her thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>I have separated and distributed as I could some of the parts which blended in the rich composite energy which <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> exerted during the <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> over which my occasional interviews with her were scattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>It remains to say, that all these powers and accomplishments found their best and only adequate channel in her conversation; &mdash;a conversation which those who have heard it, unanimously, as far as I know, pronounced to be, in elegance, in range, in flexibility, and adroit transition, in depth, in cordiality, and in moral aim, altogether admirable; surprising and cheerful as a poem, and communicating its own civility and elevation like a charm to all hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3370"/>She was here, among our anxious citizens, and frivolous fashionists, as if sent to refine and polish her countrymen, <pb id="p.1312" n="1312"/> and announce a better day. She poured a stream of amber over the endless store of private anecdotes, of bosom histories, which her wonderful persuasion drew forth, and transfigured them into fine fables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3371"/>Whilst she embellished the moment, her conversation had the merit of being solid and true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>She put her whole character into it, and had the power to inspire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>The companion was made a thinker, and went away quite other than he came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>The circle of friends who sat with her were not allowed to remain spectators or players, but she converted them into heroes, if she could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>The muse woke the muses, and the day grew bright and eventful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>Of course, there must be, in a person of such sincerity, much variety of aspect, according to the character of her company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>Only, in <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s case, there is almost an agreement in the testimony to an invariable power over the minds of all. I conversed lately with a gentleman who has vivid remembrances of his interviews with her in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, many years ago, who described her in these terms:&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">No <num value="1">one</num> ever came so near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>Her mood applied itself to the mood of her companion, point to point, in the most limber, sinuous, vital way, and drew out the most extraordinary narratives; yet she had a light sort of laugh, when all was said, as if she thought she could live over that revelation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>And this sufficient sympathy she had for all persons indifferently,&mdash;for lovers, for artists, and beautiful maids, and ambitious young statesmen, and for old aunts, and coach-travellers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/>Ah! she applied herself to the mood of her companion, as the sponge applies itself to water.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>The description tallies well enough with my observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>I remember she found, <num value="1">one</num> day, at my house, her old friend Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, sitting with me. She looked at him attentively, and <pb id="p.1313" n="1313"/> hardly seemed to know him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3421"/>She was a companion as few others, if indeed any <num value="1">one</num>, have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3422"/>Her heart was underneath her intellectualness, her mind was reverent, her spirit devout; a thinker without dryness; a scholar without pedantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/>With her unusual wisdom and religious spirit, she seemed like the priestess of the youth, opening to him the fields of nature; but she was more than a priestess, a companion also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>As I recall her image, I think she may have been too intellectual, and too conscious of intellectual relation, so that she was not sufficiently self-centred on her own personality; and hence something of a duality: but I may not be correct in this impression.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3448"/>There was much antagonism in their habitual views, but each learned to respect the genius of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3449"/>She had more sympathy with <persName n="Alcott,Mister,,,," id="n0234.0005.01321.00686" reg="mostcommon:Alcott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Alcott</surname></persName>'s English friend, <placeName reg="Charles Lane">Charles Lane</placeName>, an ingenious mystic, and bold experimenter in practical reforms, whose dexterity and temper in debate she frankly admired, whilst his asceticism engaged her reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3452"/>Of the few events of her bright and blameless years, how many are private, and must remain so. In reciting the story of an affectionate and passionate woman, the voice lowers itself to a whisper, and becomes inaudible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3453"/>A woman in our society finds her safety and happiness in exclusions and privacies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>She congratulates herself when she is not called to the market, to the courts, to the polls, to the stage, or to the orchestra.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3455"/>Only the most extraordinary genius can make the career of an <pb id="p.1322" n="1322"/> artist secure and agreeable to her. Prescriptions almost invincible the female lecturer or professor of any science must encounter; and, except on points where the charities which are left to women as their legitimate province interpose against the ferocity of laws, with us a female politician is unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3456"/>Perhaps this fact, which so dangerously narrows the career of a woman, accuses the tardiness of our civility, and many signs show that a revolution is already on foot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3457"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> had no love of notoriety, or taste for eccentricity, to goad her, and no weak fear of either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3458"/>Willingly she was confined to the usual circles and methods of female talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3459"/>She had no false shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3460"/>Any task that called out her powers was good and desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3461"/>She wished to live by her strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3462"/>She could converse, and teach, and write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3463"/>She took private classes of pupils at her own house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3464"/>She organized, with great success, a school for young ladies at <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, and gave <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> a day to it, during <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. She translated <persName n="Eckermann,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01322.00688" reg="mostcommon:Eckermann,nomatch:0"><surname>Eckermann</surname></persName>'s Conversations with <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01322.00689" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, and published in <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/>In <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct>, she made a tour to <placeName reg="Lake Superior, Sullivan, New York" key="tgn,2705250">Lake Superior</placeName> and to <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, and published an agreeable narrative of it, called <q direct="unspecified">Summer on the <rs type="place">Lakes</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3467"/></p> 
<p>Apparently a more pretending, but really also a private and friendly service, she edited the <q direct="unspecified">Dial,</q> a quarterly journal, for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> from its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> publication in <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3468"/>She was eagerly solicited to undertake the charge of this work, which, when it began, concentrated a good deal of hope and affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3469"/>It had its origin in a club of speculative students, who found the air in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> getting a little close and stagnant; and the agitation <pb id="p.1323" n="1323"/> had perhaps the fault of being too secondary or bookish in its origin, or caught not from primary instincts, but from <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01323.00690" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, and still more from <name>German</name> books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3470"/>The journal was commenced with much hope, and liberal promises of many cooperators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3471"/>But the workmen of sufficient culture for a poetical and philosophical magazine were too few; and, as the pages were filled by unpaid contributors, each of whom had, according to the usage and necessity of this country, some paying employment, the journal did not get his best work, but his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3472"/>Its scattered writers had not digested their theories into a distinct dogma, still less into a practical measure which the public could grasp; and the magazine was so eclectic and miscellaneous, that each of its readers and writers valued only a small portion of it. For these reasons it never had a large circulation, and it was discontinued after <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>. But the <name>Dial</name> betrayed, through all its juvenility, timidity, and conventional rubbish, some sparks of the true love and hope, and of the piety to spiritual law, which had moved its friends and founders, and it was received by its early subscribers with almost a religious welcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3473"/>Many years after it was brought to a close, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was surprised in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> by very warm testimony to its merits; and, in <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>, the writer of these pages found it holding the same affectionate place in many a private bookshelf in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName>, which it had secured at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3474"/>Good or bad, it cost a good deal of precious labor from those who served it, and from <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> most of all. As editor, she received a compensation for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> years, which was intended to be <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">two hundred dollars</measure> <hi rend="italics">per annum</hi>, but which, I fear, never reached even that amount.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3475"/>But it made no difference to her exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3476"/>She put so <pb id="p.1324" n="1324"/> much heart into it that she bravely undertook to open, in the <name>Dial</name>, the subjects which most attracted her; and she treated, in turn, <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01324.00691" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Beethoven,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01324.00692" reg="mostcommon:Beethoven,nomatch:0"><surname>Beethoven</surname></persName>, the <rs>Rhine</rs> and the <rs>Romaic Ballads</rs>, the <name>Poems</name> of <persName n="Sterling,,John,,," id="n0234.0005.01324.00693" reg="default:Sterling,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Sterling</surname></persName>, and several pieces of sentiment, with a spirit which spared no labor; and, when the hard conditions of journalism held her to an inevitable day, she submitted to jeopardizing a long-cherished subject, by treating it in the crude and forced article for the month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3477"/>I remember, after she had been compelled by ill health to relinquish the journal into my hands, my grateful wonder at the facility with which she assumed the preparation of laborious articles, that might have daunted the most practised scribe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3478"/>But in book or journal she found a very imperfect expression of herself, and it was the more vexatious, because she was accustomed to the clearest and fullest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>When, therefore, she had to choose an employment that should pay money, she consulted her own genius, as well as the wishes of a multitude of friends, in opening a class for conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3480"/>In the autumn of <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>, she addressed the following letter, intended for circulation, to <persName n="Ripley,Mrs.,George,,," id="n0234.0005.01324.00694" reg="default:Ripley,George,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName>, in which her general design was stated:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3481"/>My dear friend:&mdash;The advantages of a weekly meeting, for conversation, might be great enough to repay the trouble of attendance, if they consisted only in supplying a point of union to well-educated and thinking women, in a city which, with great pretensions to mental refinement, boasts, at present, nothing of the kind, and where I have heard many, of mature age, wish for some such means of stimulus and cheer, and those younger, for a place where they could state their doubts and difficulties, with a hope of gaining <pb id="p.1325" n="1325"/> aid from the experience or aspirations of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3482"/>And, if my office were only to suggest topics, which would lead to conversation of a better order than is usual at social meetings, and to turn back the current when digressing into personalities or common-places, so that what is valuable in the experience of each might be brought to bear upon all, I should think the object not unworthy of the effort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3483"/>But my ambition goes much further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3484"/>It is to pass in review the departments of thought and knowledge, and endeavor to place them in due relation to <num value="1">one</num> another in our minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3485"/>To systematize thought, and give a precision and clearness in which our sex are so deficient, chiefly, I think, because they have so few inducements to test and classify what they receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3486"/>To ascertain what pursuits are best suited to us, in our time and state of society, and how we may make best use of our means for building up the life of thought upon the life of action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3487"/>Could a circle be assembled in earnest, desirous to answer the questions,&mdash;What were we born to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3488"/>and how shall we do it? &mdash;which so few ever propose to themselves till their best years are gone by, I should think the undertaking a noble <num value="1">one</num>, and, if my resources should prove sufficient to make me its moving spring, I should be willing to give to it a large portion of those coming years, which will, as I hope, be my best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3489"/>I look upon it with no blind enthusiasm, nor uhlimited faith, but with a confidence that I have attained a distinct perception of means, which, if there are persons competent to direct them, can supply a great want, and promote really high objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3490"/>So far as I have tried them yet, they have met with success so much beyond <pb id="p.1326" n="1326"/> my hopes, that my faith will not easily be shaken, nor my earnestness chilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3491"/>Should I, however, be disappointed in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, I could hardly hope that such a plan could be brought to bear on <rs n="General Society" type="misc">general society</rs>, in any other city of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3492"/>But I do not fear, if a good beginning can be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3493"/>I am confident that <num value="20">twenty</num> persons cannot be brought together from better motives than vanity or pedantry, to talk upon such subjects as we propose, without finding in themselves great deficiencies, which they will be very desirous to supply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>Should the enterprise fail, it will be either from incompetence in me, or that sort of vanity in them which wears the garb of modesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct> of these points, I need not speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/>I cannot be supposed to have felt so much the wants of others, without feeling my own still more deeply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>And, from the depth of this feeling, and the earnestness it gave, such power as I have yet exerted has come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>Of course, those who are inclined to meet me, feel a confidence in me, and should they be disappointed, I shall regret it not solely or most on my own account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>I have not given my gauge without measuring my capacity to sustain defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>For the other, I know it is very hard to lay aside the shelter of vague generalities, the art of coterie criticism, and the <q direct="unspecified">delicate disdains</q> of <hi rend="italics">good society</hi>, and fearlessly meet the light, even though it flow from the sun of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>Yet, as, without such generous courage, nothing of value can be learned or done, I hope to see many capable of it; willing that others should think their sayings crude, shallow, or tasteless, if, by such unpleasant means, they may attain real health <pb id="p.1327" n="1327"/> and vigor, which need no aid from rouge or candlelight, to brave the light of the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/>Since I saw you, I have been told of persons who are desirous to join the class, <q direct="unspecified">if only they need not talk.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3503"/>I am so sure that the success of the whole depends on conversation being general, that I do not wish any <num value="1">one</num> to come, who does not intend, if possible, to take an active part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>No <num value="1">one</num> will be forced, but those who do not talk will not derive the same advantages with those who openly state their impressions, and can consent to have it known that they learn by blundering, as is the destiny of man here below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>And general silence, or side talks, would paralyze me. I should feel coarse and misplaced, were I to harangue over-much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>In former instances, I have been able to make it easy and even pleasant, to <num value="25">twenty-five</num> out of <num value="30">thirty</num>, to bear their part, to question, to define, to state, and examine opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>If I could not do as much now, I should consider myself as unsuccessful, and should withdraw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>But I shall expect communication to be effected by degrees, and to do a great deal myself at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>My method has been to open a subject,&mdash;for instance, Poetry, as expressed in&mdash;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>External Nature;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>The characters of its great men; and, after as good a general statement as I know how to make, select a branch of the subject, and lead <pb id="p.1328" n="1328"/> others to give their thoughts upon it. When they have not been successful in verbal utterance of their thoughts, I have asked them to attempt it in writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>At the next meeting, I would read these <q direct="unspecified">skarts of pen and ink</q> aloud, and canvass their adequacy, without mentioning the names of the writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>I found this less necessary, as I proceeded, and my companions attained greater command both of thought and language; but for a time it was useful, and may be now. Great advantage in point of discipline may be derived from even this limited use of the pen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>I do not wish, at present, to pledge myself to any course of subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>Generally, I may say, they will be such as literature and the arts present in endless profusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>Should a class be brought together, I should wish, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to ascertain our common ground, and, in the course of a few meetings, should see whether it be practicable to follow out the design in my mind, which, as yet, would look too grand on paper.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>Women are now taught, at school, all that men are; they run over, superficially, even <hi rend="italics">more</hi> studies, without being really taught anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>When they come to the business of life, they find themselves inferior, and all their studies have not given them that practical good sense, and mother wisdom, and wit, which grew up with our grandmothers at the spinning-wheel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>But, with this difference; men are called on, from a very early period, to reproduce all that they learn Their college exercises, their political duties, their professional studies, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> actions of life in any direction, call on them to put to use what they have learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>But women learn without any attempt to reproduce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>Their only reproduction is for purposes of display.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>She was not here to teach; but she had had some experience in the management of such a conversation as was now proposed; she meant to give her view on each subject, and provoke the thoughts of others.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>It would be best to take subjects on which we know words, and have vague impressions, and compel ourselves to define those words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>It is quite separated from all exciting local subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>It is serious, without being solemn, and without excluding any mode of intellectual action; it is playful, as well as deep.

company of matrons and maids, many tender spirits had been set in ferment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>A new day had <pb id="p.1338" n="1338"/> dawned for them; new thoughts had opened; the secret of life was shown, or, at least, that life had a secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>They could not forget what they had heard, and what they had been surprised into saying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>A true refinement had begun to work in many who had been slaves to trifles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/>They went home thoughtful and happy, since the steady elevation of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s aim had infused a certain unexpected greatness of tone into the conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>It was, I believe, only an expression of the feeling of the class, the remark made, perhaps at the next year's course, by a lady of eminent powers, previously by no means partial to <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, and who expressed her frank admiration on leaving the house:&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">I never heard, read of, or imagined a conversation at all equal to this we have now heard.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/></p> 
<p>The strongest wishes were expressed, on all sides, that the conversations should be renewed at the beginning of the following winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3639"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> willingly consented; but, as I have already intimated, in the <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">autumn</rs> of <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, she had retreated to some interior shrine, and believed that she came into life and society with some advantage from this devotion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>Of this feeling the new discussion bore evident traces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/><pb id="p.1339" n="1339"/> Most of the last year's class returned, and new members gave in their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting was holden on the <dateStruct value="1840-11-22"><day reg="22">twenty-second</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3643"/>By all accounts it was the best of all her days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3644"/>I have again the notes, taken at the time, of the excellent lady at whose house it was held, to furnish the following sketch of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and the following meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>It was a noble meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>I told them the great changes in my mind, and that I could not be sure they would be satisfied with me now, as they were when I was in deliberate possession of myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>I tried to convey the truth, and though I did not arrive at any full expression of it, they all, with glistening eyes, seemed melted into <num value="1">one</num> love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>She attended anxiously on me, and asked if it would be so all winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>I said, if it were I did not care; and truly I feel just now such a separation from pain and illness,&mdash;such a consciousness of true life, while suffering most,&mdash; <pb id="p.1340" n="1340"/> that pain has no effect but to steal some of my time.</p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

The company collected proved much larger than any of us had anticipated: a chosen company,&mdash;several persons from homes out of town, at considerable inconvenience; and, in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> instances, fresh from extreme experiences of joy and grief,&mdash;which <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> felt a very grateful tribute to her. She knew no <num value="1">one</num> came for experiment, but all in earnest love and trust, and was moved by it quite to the heart, which threw an indescribable charm of softness over her brilliancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>It is sometimes said, that women never are so lovely and enchanting in the company of their own sex, merely, but it requires the other to draw them out. Certain it is that <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> never appears, when I see her, either so brilliant and deep in thought, or so desirous to please, or so modest, or so heart-touching, as in this very party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>Well, she began to say how gratifying it was to her to see so many come, because all knew why they came,&mdash;that it was to learn from each other and ourselves the highest ends of life, where there could be no excitements and gratifications of personal ambition, &amp;c. She spoke of herself, and said she felt she had undergone changes in her own mind since the last winter, as doubtless we all felt we had done; that she was conscious of looking at all things less objectively,&mdash;more from the law with which she identified herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>This, she stated, was the natural progress of our individual being, when we did not hinder its development, <pb id="p.1341" n="1341"/> to advance from objects to law, from the circumference of being, where we found ourselves at our birth, to the centre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>This advance was enacted poesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>We could not, in our individual lives, amid the disturbing influences of other wills, which had as much right to their own action as we to ours, enact poetry entirely; the discordant, the inferior, the prose, would intrude, but we should always keep in mind that poetry of life was not something aside, &mdash;a path that might or might not be trod,&mdash;it was the only path of the true soul; and prose you may call the deviation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>We might not always be poetic in life, but we might and should be poetic in our thought and intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>The fine arts were <num value="1">one</num> compensation for the necessary prose of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>The man who could not write his thought of beauty in his life,&mdash;the materials of whose life would not work up into poetry,&mdash;wrote it in stone, drew it on canvas, breathed it in music, or built it in lofty rhyme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>In this statement, however, she guarded her meaning, and said that to seek beauty was to miss it often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>We should only seek to live as harmoniously with the great laws as our social and other duties permitted, and solace ourselves with poetry and the fine arts.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>I find a further record by the same friendly scribe, which seems a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and enlarged account of the introductory conversation, or else a sketch of the course of thought which ran through several meetings, and which very naturally repeated occasionally the same thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>I give it as I find it:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/></p> 
<p>She then recurred to the last year's conversations <pb id="p.1342" n="1342"/> and, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the <rs>Grecian</rs> mythologies, which she looked at as symbolical of a deeper intellectual and aesthetic life than we were wont to esteem it, when looking at it from a narrow religious point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>We had merely skimmed along the deeper study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>She spoke of the conversations on the different part played by Inspiration and Will in the works of man, and stated the different views of inspiration,&mdash;how some had felt it was merely perception; others apprehended it as influx upon the soul from the soul-side of its being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/>Then she spoke of the conversation upon poesy as the ground of all the fine arts, and also of the true art of life; it being not merely truth, not merely good, but the beauty which integrates both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>On this poesy, she dwelt long, aiming to show how life,&mdash;perfect life,&mdash; could be the only perfect manifestation of it. Then she spoke of the individual as surrounded, however, by <hi rend="italics">prose</hi>,&mdash;so we may here call the manifestation of the temporary, in opposition to the eternal, always trenching on it, and circumscribing and darkening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>She spoke of the acceptance of this limitation, but it should be called by the right name, and always measured; and we should inwardly cling to the truth that poesy was the natural life of the soul; and never yield inwardly to the common notion that poesy was a luxury, out of the common track; but maintain in word and life that prose carried the soul out of its track; and then, perhaps, it would not injure us to walk in these by-paths, when forced thither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>She admitted that prose was the necessary human condition, and quickened our life indirectly by necessitating a conscious demand on the source of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>In reply to a remark I made, she very strongly stated the difference between a poetic and a <hi rend="italics">dilettante</hi> <pb id="p.1343" n="1343"/> life, and sympathized with the sensible people who were tired of hearing all the young ladies of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> sighing like furnace after being beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3678"/>Beauty was something very different from prettiness, and a microscopic vision missed the grand whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>The fine arts were our compensation for not being able to live out our poesy, amid the conflicting and disturbing forces of this moral world in which we are. In sculpture, the heights to which our being comes are represented; and its nature is such as to allow us to leave out all that vulgarizes,&mdash; all that bridges over to the actual from the ideal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3680"/>She dwelt long upon sculpture, which seems her favorite art. That was grand, when a man <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought to engrave his idea of man upon a stone, the most unyielding and material of materials,&mdash;the backbone of this phenomenal earth,&mdash;and, when he did not succeed, that he persevered; and so, at last, by repeated efforts, the <name>Apollo</name> came to be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3681"/>But, no; music she thought the greatest of arts, &mdash;expressing what was most interior,&mdash;what was too fine to be put into any material grosser than air; conveying from soul to soul the most secret motions of feeling and thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3682"/>This was the only fine art which might be thought to be flourishing now. The others had had their day. This was advancing upon a higher intellectual ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3683"/>Of painting she spoke, but not so well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3684"/>She seemed to think painting worked more by illusion than sculpture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3685"/>It involved more prose, from its representing more objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3686"/>She said nothing adequate about <hi rend="italics">color</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/>She dwelt upon the histrionic art as the most complete, its organ being the most flexible and powerful.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>She then spoke of life, as the art, of which these all <pb id="p.1344" n="1344"/> were beautiful symbols; and said, in recurring to her opinions expressed last winter, of <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01344.00781" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wordsworth,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01344.00782" reg="mostcommon:Wordsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wordsworth</surname></persName>, that she had taken another view, deeper, and more in accordance with some others which were then expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>She acknowledged that <persName n="Wordsworth,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01344.00783" reg="mostcommon:Wordsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wordsworth</surname></persName> had done more to make all men poetical, than perhaps any other; that he was the poet of reflection; that where he failed to poetize his subject, his simple faith intimated to the reader a poetry that he did not find in the book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/>She admitted that <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01344.00784" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName>'s Narrative was instinct with the poetry concentrated often in single words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>She uttered her old heresies about <placeName reg="Milton, Norfolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014069">Milton</placeName>, however, unmodified.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>I do not remember the transition to modern poetry and <persName n="Milnes,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01344.00785" reg="mostcommon:Milnes,nomatch:0"><surname>Milnes</surname></persName>; but she read (very badly indeed) the <rs>Legendary Tale</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>We then had <num value="3">three</num> conversations upon Sculpture, <num value="1">one</num> of which was taken up very much in historical accounts of the sculpture of the ancients, in which color was added to form, and which seemed to prove that they were not, after all, sufficiently intellectual to be operated on by form exclusively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>The question, of course, arose whether there was a modern sculpture, and why not. This led us to speak of the <name>Greek</name> sculpture as growing naturally out of their life and religion, and how alien it was to our life and to our religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>The <persName><foreName>Swiss</foreName></persName> lion, carved by <persName n="Thorwaldsen,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01344.00786" reg="mostcommon:Thorwaldsen,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorwaldsen</surname></persName> but of the side of a mountain rock, was described as a natural growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>Those who had seen it described it; and <rs type="role2">Mrs</rs>.&mdash;&mdash;spoke of it. She was also led to the story of her acquaintance with <persName n="Thorwaldsen,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01344.00787" reg="mostcommon:Thorwaldsen,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorwaldsen</surname></persName>, and drew tears from many eyes with her natural eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/><pb id="p.1345" n="1345"/></p> 
<p><rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> C. asked, if sculpture could express as well as painting the idea of immortality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> thought the <name>Greek</name> art expressed immortality as much as <name>Christian</name> art, but did not throw it into the future, by preeminence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>They expressed it in the present, by casting out of the mortal body every expression of infirmity and decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3700"/>The idealization of the human form makes a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3701"/>The fact that man can conceive and express this perfection of being, is as good a witness to immortality, as the look of aspiration in the countenance of a Magdalen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3702"/>It is quite beyond the power of my memory to recall all the bright utterances of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, in these conversations on Sculpture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>It was a favorite subject with her. Then came <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> conversations on Painting, in which it seemed to be conceded that color expressed passion, whilst sculpture more severely expressed thought: yet painting did not exclude the expression of thought, or sculpture that of feeling,&mdash;witness <persName n="Niobe,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01345.00788" reg="mostcommon:Niobe,nomatch:0"><surname>Niobe</surname></persName>,&mdash;but it must be an universal feeling, like the maternal sentiment.</p></quote> <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was then pressed to say what she considered life to be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>Her answer was so full, clear, and concise, at once, that it cannot but be marred by being drawn through the scattering medium of my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>But here are some fragments of her satisfying statement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>She began with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as Spirit, Life, so full as to create and love eternally, yet capable of pause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>Love and creativeness are dynamic forces, out of which we, individually, as creatures, go forth bearing his image, that <pb id="p.1347" n="1347"/> is, having within our being the same dynamic forces, by which we also add constantly to the total sum of existence, and shaking off ignorance, and its effects, and by becoming more ourselves, <hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., more divine;&mdash;destroying sin in its principle, we attain to absolute freedom, we return to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, conscious like himself, and, as his friends, giving, as well as receiving, felicity forevermore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> said she had forgotten every word she said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>She must have been inspired by a good genius, to have so satisfied everybody,&mdash;but the good genius had left her. She would try, however, to say what she thought, and trusted it would resemble what she had said already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>She then went into the matter, and, true enough, she did not use a single word she used before.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>The fame of these conversations spread wide through all families and social circles of the ladies attending, and the golden report they gave, led to a proposal, that <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> should undertake an evening class, of <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> lessons, to which gentlemen should also be admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>This was put in effect, in the course of the winter, and I had, myself the pleasure of assisting at <num value="1">one</num>&mdash;the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>&mdash;of these soirees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>The subject was Mythology, and several gentlemen took part in it. <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> spoke well,&mdash;she could not otherwise,&mdash;but I remember that she seemed encumbered, or interrupted, by the headiness or incapacity of the men, whom she had not had the advantage of training, and who fancied, no doubt, that, <pb id="p.1348" n="1348"/> on such a question, they, too, must assert and dogmatize.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>But, how well or ill they fared, may still be known; since the same true hand which reported for the <rs>Ladies</rs>' Class, drew up, at the time, the following note of the <name>Evenings</name> of Mythology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>My distance from town, and engagements, prevented me from attending again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>I was told that on the preceding and following evenings the success was more decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p></p> 
<p><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s plan, in these conversations, was a very noble <num value="1">one</num>, and, had it been seconded, as she expected, they would have been splendid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>She thought, that, by admitting gentlemen, who had access, by their classical education, to the whole historical part of the mythology, her own comparative deficiency, as she felt it, in this part of learning, would be made up; and that taking her stand on the works of art, which were the final development in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> of these multifarious fables, the whole subject might be swept from zenith to nadir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>But all that depended on others entirely failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> W. contributed some isolated facts,&mdash;told the etymology of names, and cited a few fables not so commonly known as most; but, even in the point of erudition, which <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> did not profess, on the subject, she proved the best informed of the party, while no <num value="1">one</num> brought an idea, except herself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>Her general idea was, that, upon the Earth-worship and Sabaeanism of earlier ages, the <rs>Grecian</rs> genius acted to humanize and idealize, but, still, with some regard to the original principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>What was a seed, or a root, merely, in the <rs>Egyptian</rs> mind, became a flower in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>,&mdash;Isis, and <persName n="Osiris,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01348.00789" reg="mostcommon:Osiris,nomatch:0"><surname>Osiris</surname></persName>, for instance, are reproduced in <pb id="p.1349" n="1349"/> <persName n="Ceres,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01349.00790" reg="mostcommon:Ceres,nomatch:0"><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> and Proserpine, with some loss of generality, but with great gain of beauty; <persName n="Hermes,,,,," id="n0234.0005.01349.00791" reg="mostcommon:Hermes,nomatch:0"><surname>Hermes</surname></persName>, in Mercury, with only more grace of form, though with great loss of grandeur; but the loss of grandeur was also an advance in philosophy, in this instance, the brain in the hand being the natural consequence of the application of Idea to practice,&mdash;the <rs>Hermes</rs> of the <name>Egyptians</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>I do not feel that the class, by their apprehension of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, do any justice to the scope and depth of her views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>They come,&mdash;myself among the number,&mdash;I confess,&mdash;to be entertained; but she has a higher purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>She, amid all her infirmities, studies and thinks with the seriousness of <num value="1">one</num> upon oath, and there has not been a single conversation this winter, in either class, that had not in it the spirit which giveth life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>Just in proportion to the importance of the subject, does she tax her mind, and say what is most important; while, of necessity, nothing is reported from the conversations but her brilliant sallies, her occasional paradoxes of form, and, sometimes, her impatient reacting upon dulness and frivolity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>In particular points, I know, some excel her; in particular departments I sympathize more with some other persons; but, take her as a whole, she has the most to bestow on others by conversation of any person I have ever known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>I cannot conceive of any species of vanity living in her presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>She distances all who talk with her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> E. only served to display her powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/>With his sturdy reiteration of his uncompromising idealism, his absolute denial of the fact of human nature, he gave her opportunity and excitement to unfold and illustrate her realism and acceptance of conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>What is so noble is, that her realism is transparent with idea,&mdash;her human <pb id="p.1350" n="1350"/> nature is the gem of a divine life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>She proceeds in her search after the unity of things, the divine harmony, not by exclusion, as <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> E. does, but by comprehension,&mdash;and so, no poorest, saddest spirit, but she will lead to hope and faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3760"/>I have thought, sometimes, that her acceptance of evil was <hi rend="italics">too great</hi>,&mdash;that her theory of the good to be educed proved too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>But in a conversation I had with her yesterday, I understood her better than I had done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/><quote>It might never be sin to us, at the moment,</quote> she said, <quote>it must be an excess, on which conscience puts the restraint</quote> </p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3764"/>But the notes of my principal reporter fail me at this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>The general subject I do not find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3972"/>Her father, though an artisan of moderate circumstances, was quite scholarly for his day and condition in life, and possessed an original turn of mind, as well as marked independence of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3973"/>He left some disquisitions, preserved by his family, of no literary excellence, but indicative of a strong and untutored mind, coping with the intellectual problems of life, and feeling after truth by the unaided light of individual thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3974"/>He was noted for going on in his own course, with utter disregard of popularity, and of the view which others might take of his conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3975"/>He served in the revolutionary war, and at <num value="1">one</num> time, when there was no chaplain, performed the duties of that office for his regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3976"/>Though belonging to no church, and entertaining, perhaps, rather crude views of his own in religious things, yet he had an influence over the minds of others, which induced his counsel and his prayers to be sought for in circumstances of distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3977"/>He died before I was born; but my grandmother lived till after I attained manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3978"/>My father and mother often visited her at <placeName reg="Canton, Norfolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049559">Canton</placeName>, riding in a chaise, and carrying <num value="1">one</num> of the children, <pb id="p.1374" n="1374"/> sitting on a cricket at their feet; and my turn for these journeys came often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/>My father was an ardent lover of nature, which he doubly enjoyed in his escapes from the pressure of public and professional business; and his enjoyment of it, and the points of interest he called attention to, heightened my relish for this pure gratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>He drove slowly, and sang with my mother on the way. These journeys are ever memorable with me; and the visits were always celebrated in sacred song among the <rs>Canton</rs> kindred, which my father accompanied with the flute, enjoying music with almost passionate delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3981"/>Arriving at <placeName reg="Canton, Norfolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049559">Canton</placeName>, we were always joyously greeted by the bright and sunny face of my aged grandmother, who lived with a maiden aunt, and the uniformity of whose life was very agreeably varied by these visits, while my father never neglected to bring generous supplies for her rather meagre larder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3982"/>She was a very pious woman, in the simplicity and devotion of the <rs type="place">Baxter school</rs>, whose <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Saint</rs>'s Rest,</q> as well as the works of <persName n="Watts,,,,," id="n0234.0006.01374.00905" reg="mostcommon:Watts,nomatch:0"><surname>Watts</surname></persName> and <persName n="Doddridge,,,,," id="n0234.0006.01374.00906" reg="mostcommon:Doddridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Doddridge</surname></persName>, were very familiar and precious to her, and formed, with her ever-diligently conned and well-worn Bible, almost the whole range of her literary acquirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>She was very fond of singing devotional hymns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>Among others, I remember <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName></q> was a great favorite, sung even with her last failing voice upon her death bed. As she sang it, the minor cadence and its reference to the grave rather affrighted and repelled my childish taste; but I have since been able to appreciate the sentiment which made it attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3985"/>My grandmother had great sweetness of temper and a sunshine of disposition, which may have been received by my mother as an hereditary gift.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>In childhood and youth, my mother was marked not only for rare bloom and personal beauty, but for an almost irrepressible gayety and buoyancy of temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>She was as full of the elasticity of life, and her heart as overflowing with the music of nature, as the early songsters of spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>She was <pb id="p.1375" n="1375"/> above the medium height of woman, being in stature about <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> and <num value="9">nine</num> or <measure n="10inches" type="distance">ten inches</measure>, and considerably taller than my father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>She had blue eyes, a fair, white complexion, not liable to tan or freckle, and a rich bloom, like that of the peach, in her cheeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>This bloom was a very marked characteristic of her face, and <num value="1">one</num> that she retained to quite mature life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3991"/>It was transmitted to her daughter <persName><foreName>Ellen</foreName></persName>, and its rose has reappeared undiminished in the blooming cheeks of some of her grandchildren.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>My mother had a very happy childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3993"/>Her own temper, with its rare elasticity, was then, and ever through life, a fund of happiness for herself as well as others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3994"/>As a child and maiden, she had a wild exuberance of spirits, regulated, however, by as strong a benevolence, and a tenderness of feeling and sympathy, which made her generally beloved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3995"/>Her fondness for flowers was ever a passion with her, if so gentle and refined a sentiment may be thus denominated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>I have heard her speak of her mother as <num value="1">one</num> who, though sweet and loving, was determined not to spoil the child by sparing the rod, when occasion required its exercise, which, happily, was seldom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, however, her mother had forbidden the children to eat certain grapes, and <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> had yielded to the temptation of the luscious fruit, and despoiled the vine of some of its clusters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3998"/>Her mother inquired of <persName><foreName>Abby</foreName></persName>, a younger daughter, if she had done it, and was answered, <q direct="unspecified">No.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>On being further interrogated if she knew the offending party, <persName><foreName>Abby</foreName></persName> would not reply; and her mother attempted with the rod to compel her to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/><persName><foreName>Abby</foreName></persName> bore it with heroic endurance, and continued mute, till <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, unable to endure the sight of this vicarious suffering, confessed the deed, and thereby transferred the rod to her own more deserving shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>Before she was out of her teens, she taught school in the district where she resided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4002"/><num value="1">One</num> large boy presumed upon his familiar acquaintance and her well-known playfulness of disposition, <pb id="p.1376" n="1376"/> which he could hardly believe it possible for her to lay aside, and showed a disinclination to submit to her sceptre in the school room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4003"/>She displayed her characteristic energy and courage, called the boy out upon the floor, and, ere he could collect his forces for resistance, ferruled him soundly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4004"/>The dismayed youth quailed and submitted, and her authority was afterwards unquestioned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4005"/>My mother has given some rather grotesque accounts of riding to church on a pillion; and of being sometimes taken up behind a rustic cavalier, whose invitation she had unwillingly accepted, to spare him the mortification of a refusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4006"/>It was at church that my father <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw her, she happening, through some chance, to be in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> on the <name>Sabbath</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4007"/>He loved, and his love was returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4008"/>He soon led her to the altar, a blooming girl of <num value="20">twenty</num>, and <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> younger than himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4009"/>Father was not blind to worldly advantages of family and position; and such were readily within the reach of a rising young lawyer, whose talents had already become favorably known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4010"/>But it was well for him that he yielded to a softer and a better sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4011"/><q direct="unspecified">His love for my mother,</q> says <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> in her autobiographical sketch, <q direct="unspecified">was the green spot on which he stood apart from the commonplaces of a mere bread-winning, bread-bestowing existence.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>She adds, in describing her mother, <q direct="unspecified">She was <num value="1">one</num> of those fair and flower-like natures which sometimes spring up even beside the most dusty highways of life&mdash;a creature not to be shaped into a merely useful instrument, but bound by <num value="1">one</num> law with the blue sky, the dew, and the frolic birds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>Of all persons whom I have known, she had in her most of the angelic&mdash;of that spontaneous love for every living thing, for man, and beast, and tree, which restores the golden age.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4014"/>Not only was this union a blessing to father, but favorable to the character of his children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> used to say that we derived our ideal sentiment mainly from our mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>And certainly she had a good store of refined fancy and delicate <pb id="p.1377" n="1377"/> feeling, though coupled, as they but rarely are, with a ready and and a willing mind for useful effort, graced by uninterupted benignity and sweetness, and not marred by the moody and irritable temperament which are not unfrequently the blemish of an imaginative mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>None of her sons can fail to be grateful for sentiment, from whichever parent derived, since it is not only the most satisfactory evidence of a divine and immortal germ within, but affords that purer gratification of thought and fancy, which, better than any thing in life, deserves the name of pleasure, being a satisfaction to which memory can ever revert without self-reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>It is true that such a temperament is apt to be more sensitive to the thorns in life's pathway; but, when religiously developed, which is its best and most congenial bias, it furnishes itself a corrective for its fault, and opens to the soul fountains of even heavenly consolation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>My mother's Cambridge years rather antedate my recollection; but in <placeName key="tgn,2049856" n="1.000 4" reg="groton, middlesex, massachusetts">Groton</placeName> her character and life are fresh in my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4020"/>A picture of her is very prominent in my mind, as she stooped over her flower-bed, and toiled long sunny hours over its extensive border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4021"/>Her unwearied labors in the heat attracted the admiration even of the hardy farmers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4022"/>Her expression, as she knelt by the flower bed and bent her nearsighted gaze close to a plant, and, discovering some new unfolding promise of beauty, turned round to announce it with a child-like simplicity and a delighted smile, I think can never fade from the memories of her children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4023"/>This image has often been renewed; and though latterly her hair, no less beautiful than before, has been gray, yet never thinned by years, her smile has gleamed ever with the same sunshiny, child-like triumph, her countenance never hardened or saddened by life's experience, nor her joy abated with the declining vigor of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4024"/>The flowers were ever new and ever young, and they kept her spirit still child-like in freshness of sentiment, simplicity of taste, and purity of soul, showing her ever <pb id="p.1378" n="1378"/> guileless, single-hearted, and such as are of the kingdom of heaven.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4025"/>My father's death was a dreadful stroke to my mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4026"/>It bowed her to the earth; but it did not break her spirit, and she rose again, leaning on the arm of her beloved <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>My father had been a man of strength and of success, and on him she had entirely relied, never cognizant of the practical financial problems of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>His property was in unproductive <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, and, with young children to be educated, it was necessary to change and straiten our style of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4029"/>The arithmetic of the business appalled my mother; she was as naturally inapt for it as the lilies that neither toil nor spin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4030"/>But she was always remarkable for indefatigable industry; and she applied herself to the dairy, and the farm, and the economy of the table with heroic determination, while she was aided and encouraged by <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s firm and courageous, though far from financial or business-like, mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4031"/>She ever rose early, and her voice with the morning birds roused the rest of the household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>Well do I remember the night of my father's death, when I was <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of age. The solemn tones of the minister's voice in prayer, in the chamber of death, have not been&mdash;can never be&mdash;forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>Very soon after I was confined to my bed for a fortnight, with fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>Mother feared it might prove fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>She never faltered; she was with me night and day. I remember well her voice as she called me her <q direct="unspecified">dear lamb.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>Her soothing, gentle hand had no ornament but her simple <rs n="wedding ring" type="product">wedding-ring</rs> of gold, without any stone, which she always wore, and which was buried with her. After my father's death she devoted every energy, with untiring self-sacrifice, to her children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>Her economy in respect to herself was most rigorous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>Her dress was as plain and simple as propriety would permit, and it was preserved with great care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>She always persevered in this self-denial, wishing to husband what was hers for others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>Her annual income from her share of the property was <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="600">six hundred</num> <pb id="p.1379" n="1379"/> dollars, and she invariably saved about half of it, till the lot was purchased at <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2140130">Mount Auburn</placeName>, which was obtained to commemorate the dear departed, and to testify her perennial remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>She contributed largely and principally toward its marble memorials, and adorned it with flowers, whose growth she assiduously fostered with her own hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>We think this was a great solace to her; and it evidently furnished her satisfaction, not merely to keep green and fresh holy memories, but to express in the language of flowers her never doubting <name>Christian</name> faith.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>At <placeName key="tgn,2049856" n="1.000 4" reg="groton, middlesex, massachusetts">Groton</placeName> she was active in the efforts of the religious society to which she belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>Indeed, from the time she united with the <orgName n="Unitarian Church" type="church">Unitarian Church</orgName> in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, soon after her marriage, till her last sickness, and even during it, as far as possible, she was much and actively engaged in religious effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>Loving and full of charity towards those of every <name>Christian</name> name, she was herself an earnest and devoted <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0234.0006.01379.00907" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName>, through evil report and good report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/>She was among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> who formed the <rs type="place">Lee Street Church</rs> and Society, in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>; nor can her efforts in its behalf be soon forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>When her son, <persName n="Fuller,Reverend,Arthur,B.,," id="n0234.0006.01379.00908" reg="expanded:Fuller,Arthur,Buckminster,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Arthur</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, was settled in <placeName reg="Manchester, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013989">Manchester, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>Her sympathy for all, her teaching in the <orgName n="Sabbath School" type="school">Sabbath school</orgName>, her interest, always cordial and as laborious as her years would permit, in the benevolent organization of the society, and her <name>Christian</name> graces, which shone with so mild and lovely a light, won affection as well as respect from all who came in contact with her, no matter how variant their theological creed from her own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>Benevolence, of a sympathetic and hopeful cast, overflowed from the pure fountains of her <name>Christian</name> heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>The bad awoke in her much pity and little reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/>No <num value="1">one</num> could <pb id="p.1380" n="1380"/> desire a kinder judge than she to pass upon character or determine destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4053"/>In the large charity of her soul, she hoped from the divine benignity a place for repentance would ever be preserved for all. She never spoke against others&mdash; dwelt much upon their virtues, gently and charitably upon their faults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4054"/>She reproved her children if they spoke unfavorably of the absent, and always advocated their cause, and endeavored to excuse what was alleged against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4055"/>We sometimes held up the faults of others merely to notice the ingenuity with which she would seek for excuse, or strive to throw the veil of charity over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>I shall never forget her efforts by the bedside of a large, coarse man, a tenant of ours in <placeName key="tgn,2049856" n="1.000 4" reg="groton, middlesex, massachusetts">Groton</placeName>, who lived <q direct="unspecified">without <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and without hope in the world,</q> until he took opium to end his wretched existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4057"/>Mother used every exertion to rescue him from death, and staid by him during the hours of fearful struggle between a powerful frame and the working of the poison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>In the early part of it, before his mind entirely wandered, he said, <q direct="unspecified">It will be all in vain; but you may try all means.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>The memory of this scene is in <num value="1">one</num> view appalling, as representing a gross and sensual nature meeting the fearful fate itself had invoked; but, on the other hand, is beautiful as exhibiting <num value="1">one</num>, like an angel, exerting every power to snatch him from his self-elected doom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>Mother's sympathy was sometimes taken advantage of to induce her to lend money which she could ill spare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/><num value="1">One</num> case in particular we used to jest a little about, of a man who induced her to lend him, on the plea that he <q direct="unspecified">wanted to pay his debts, and become an honest man.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4062"/>We thought it would only change his creditor, and doubted if it would not make him a less honest man, not only by the pretext he used, but by his employing the money for other objects than that alleged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4063"/>But in her readiness of sympathy she exhibited the charity that <q direct="unspecified">believeth all things.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4064"/></p> 
<p>My mother's piety was as truly genuine as any I have ever <pb id="p.1381" n="1381"/> witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4065"/>It was meek and unpretending; it had a faith which buoyed her up in all the stormy passages of life, which drew the gleam of heaven down upon the earth, and surrounded her with its sanctifying light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4066"/>Duty was her daily food&mdash;not a burden, nor an artificial action, but the spontaneous movement of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4067"/>Self-sacrifice was as natural to her as self-gratification is to many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4068"/>When I say <hi rend="italics">natural</hi>, I refer to that acquired nature which was the fruit of her <name>Christian</name> experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4069"/>She never attached any merit to self-sacrifice, nor regarded herself as having any claim to consideration with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> orman founded on it. She took spiritual nourishment as regularly as physical.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>It was while <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was residing at <placeName reg="Jamaica Plain, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015005">Jamaica Plain</placeName>, in the summer of <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>, that we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> really met as friends, though for several years previous we had been upon terms of kindest mutual regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4277"/>And, as the best way of showing how her wonderful character opened upon me, the growth of our acquaintance shall be briefly traced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4278"/>The earliest recollection of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> is as a schoolmate of my sisters, in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4279"/>At that period she was considered a prodigy of talent and accomplishment; but a sad feeling prevailed, that she had been overtasked by her father, who wished to train her like a boy, and that she was paying the penalty for undue application, in nearsightedness, awkward manners, extravagant tendencies of thought, and a pedantic style of talk, that made her a butt for the ridicule of frivolous companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4280"/>Some seasons later, I call to mind seeing, at the <q direct="unspecified">Commencements</q> and <q direct="unspecified">Exhibitions</q> of <orgName n="Harvard University" type="university">Harvard University</orgName>, a girl, plain in appearance, but of dashing air, who <pb id="p.2006" n="2006"/> was invariably the centre of a listening group, and kept their merry interest alive by sparkles of wit and incessant small-talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/>The bystanders called her familiarly, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>,</q> <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0234.0008.02006.00968" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>;</q> for, though young, she was already noted for conversational gifts, and had the rare skill of attracting to her society, not spirited collegians only, but men mature in culture and of established reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>It was impossible not to admire her fluency and fun; yet, though curiosity was piqued as to this entertaining personage, I never sought an introduction, but, on the contrary, rather shunned encounter with <num value="1">one</num> so armed from head to foot in saucy sprightliness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4283"/>About <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, however, we often met in the social circles of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and I began to observe her more nearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4284"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, her vivacity, decisive tone, downrightness, and contempt of conventional standards, continued to repel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/>She appeared too <hi rend="italics">intense</hi> in expression, action, emphasis, to be pleasing, and wanting in that <hi rend="italics">retenue</hi> which we associate with delicate dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>Occasionally, also, words flashed from her of such scathing satire, that prudence counselled the keeping at safe distance from a body so surcharged with electricity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>Then, again, there was an imperial&mdash;shall it be said imperious?&mdash;air, exacting deference to her judgments and loyalty to her behests, that prompted pride to retaliatory measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>She paid slight heed, moreover, to the trim palings of etiquette, but swept through the garden-beds and into the doorway of <num value="1">one</num>'s confidence so cavalierly, that a reserved person felt inclined to lock himself up in his sanctum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>Finally, to the coolly-scanning eye, her friendships wore a look of such romantic exaggeration, that she seemed to walk enveloped in a shining fog of sentimentalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>In brief, it must candidly be confessed, that <pb id="p.2007" n="2007"/> I then suspected her of affecting the part of a <persName n="Corinna,,Yankee,,," id="n0234.0008.02007.00969" reg="default:Corinna,Yankee,,,"><foreName>Yankee</foreName> <surname>Corinna</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/>But soon I was charmed, unaware, with the sagacity of her sallies, the profound thoughts carelessly dropped by her on transient topics, the breadth and richness of culture manifested in her allusions or quotations, her easy comprehension of new views, her just discrimination, and, above all, her <hi rend="italics">truthfulness</hi>. <q direct="unspecified">Truth at all cost,</q> was plainly her ruling maxim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>This it was that made her criticism so trenchant, her contempt of pretence so quick and stern, her speech so naked in frankness, her gaze so searching, her whole attitude so alert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>Her estimates of men, books, manners, events, art, duty, destiny, were moulded after a grand ideal; and she was a severe judge from the very loftiness of her standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>Her stately deportment, border though it might on arrogance, but expressed high-heartedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>Her independence, even if haughty and rash, was the natural action of a self-centred will, that waited only fit occasion to prove itself heroic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>Her earnestness to read the hidden history of others was the gauge of her own emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>The enthusiasm that made her speech so affluent, when measured by the average scale, was the unconscious overflow of a poetic temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>And the ardor of her friends' affection proved the faithfulness of her love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>Thus gradually the mist melted away, till I caught a glimpse of her real self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>We were <num value="1">one</num> evening talking of American literature,&mdash;she contrasting its boyish crudity, half boastful, half timid, with the tempered, manly equipoise of thorough-bred <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> writers, and I asserting that in its mingled practicality and aspiration might be read bright auguries; when, betrayed by sympathy, she laid bare her secret hope of what Woman <pb id="p.2008" n="2008"/> might be and do, as an author, in our Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>The sketch was an outline only, and dashed off with a few swift strokes, but therein appeared her own portrait, and we were strangers no more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>It was through the medium of others, however, that at this time I best learned to appreciate <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s nobleness of nature and principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>My most intimate friend in the <orgName n="Theological School" type="school">Theological School</orgName>, <persName n="Clarke,,James,Freeman,," id="n0234.0008.02008.00970" reg="default:Clarke,James,Freeman,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>Freeman</foreName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>, was her constant companion in exploring the rich gardens of <name>German</name> literature; and from his descriptions I formed a vivid image of her industry, comprehensiveness, buoyancy, patience, and came to honor her intelligent interest in high problems of science, her aspirations after spiritual greatness, her fine esthetic taste, her religiousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>By power to quicken other minds, she showed how living was her own. Yet more near were we brought by common attraction toward a youthful visitor in our circle, the untouched freshness of whose beauty was but the transparent garb of a serene, confiding, and harmonious soul, and whose polished grace, at once modest and naive, sportive and sweet, fulfilled the charm of innate goodness of heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>Susceptible in temperament, anticipating with ardent fancy the lot of a lovely and refined woman, and morbidly exaggerating her own slight personal defects, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> seemed to long, as it were, to transfuse with her force this nymph-like form, and to fill her to glowing with her own lyric fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>No drop of envy tainted the sisterly love, with which she sought by genial sympathy thus to live in another's experience, to be her guardian-angel, to shield her from contact with the unworthy, to rouse each generous impulse, to invigorate thought by truth incarnate in beauty, and with unfelt ministry to weave bright threads in her web of fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/><pb id="p.2009" n="2009"/> Thus more and more <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> became an object of respectful interest, in whose honor, magnanimity and strength I learned implicitly to trust.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>Separation, however, hindered our growing acquaintance, as we both left <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and, with the exception of a few chance meetings in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and a ramble or <num value="2">two</num> in the glens and on the beaches of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, held no further intercourse till the summer of <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>, when, as has been already said, the friendship, long before rooted, grew up and leafed and bloomed.</p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4354"/>the summer of <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct> saw the full dawn of the <name>Transcendental</name> movement in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4355"/>The rise of this enthusiasm was as mysterious as that of any form of revival; and only they who were of the faith could comprehend how bright was this morning&mdash;time of a new hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4356"/>Transcendentalism was an assertion of the inalienable integrity of man, of the immanence of Divinity in instinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4357"/>In part, it was a reaction against Puritan Orthodoxy; in part, an effect of renewed study of the ancients, of Oriental Pantheists, of <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02012.00971" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName> and the <name>Alexandrians</name>, of Plutarch's Morals, <persName n="Seneca,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02012.00972" reg="mostcommon:Seneca,nomatch:0"><surname>Seneca</surname></persName> and <persName n="Epictetus,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02012.00973" reg="mostcommon:Epictetus,nomatch:0"><surname>Epictetus</surname></persName>; in part, the natural product of the culture of the place and time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4358"/>On the somewhat stunted stock of Unitarianism,&mdash;whose characteristic dogma was trust in individual reason as correlative to Supreme Wisdom,&mdash; had been grafted German Idealism, as taught by masters of most various schools,&mdash;by <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02012.00974" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jacobi,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02012.00975" reg="mostcommon:Jacobi,nomatch:0"><surname>Jacobi</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fichte,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02012.00976" reg="mostcommon:Fichte,nomatch:0"><surname>Fichte</surname></persName> <pb id="p.2013" n="2013"/> and Novalis, <persName n="Schelling,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02013.00977" reg="mostcommon:Schelling,nomatch:0"><surname>Schelling</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hegel,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02013.00978" reg="mostcommon:Hegel,nomatch:0"><surname>Hegel</surname></persName>, <persName n="Schleiermacher,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02013.00979" reg="mostcommon:Schleiermacher,nomatch:0"><surname>Schleiermacher</surname></persName> and De Wette, by <persName n="Stael,Madame,,,,de" id="n0234.0008.02013.00980" reg="mostcommon:Stael,Dr,,,:1"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Stael</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Cousin">Cousin</rs>, <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02013.00981" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02013.00982" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>; and the result was a vague yet exalting conception of the godlike nature of the human spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4359"/>Transcendentalism, as viewed by its disciples, was a pilgrimage from the idolatrous world of creeds and rituals to the temple of the <name>Living</name> <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4360"/>It was a putting to silence of tradition and formulas, that the <rs>Sacred Oracle</rs> might be heard through intuitions of the single-eyed and pure-hearted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/>Amidst materialists, zealots, and sceptics, the <name>Transcendentalist</name> believed in perpetual inspiration, the miraculous power of will, and a birthright to universal good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4362"/>He sought to hold communion face to face with the unnameable Spirit of his spirit, and gave himself up to the embrace of nature's beautiful joy, as a babe seeks the breast of a mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/>To him the curse seemed past; and love was without fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4364"/><q direct="unspecified">All mine is thine</q> sounded forth to him in ceaseless benediction, from flowers and stars, through the poetry, art, heroism of all ages, in the aspirations of his own genius, and the budding promise of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4365"/>His work was to be faithful, as all saints, sages, and lovers of man had been, to Truth, as the very Word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4366"/>His maxims were,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Trust, dare and be; infinite good is ready for your asking; seek and find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4367"/>All that your fellows can claim or need is that you should become, in fact, your highest self; fulfil, then, your ideal.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4368"/>Hence, among the strong, withdrawal to private study and contemplation, that they might be <q direct="unspecified">alone with the <name>Alone</name>;</q> solemn yet glad devotedness to the <name>Divine</name> leadings in the inmost will; calm concentration of thought to wait for and receive wisdom; dignified independence, stern yet sweet, of fashion and public opinion; honest originality <pb id="p.2014" n="2014"/> of speech end conduct, exempt alike from apology or dictation, from servility or scorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4369"/>Hence, too, among the weak, whimsies, affectation, rude disregard of proprieties, slothful neglect of common duties, surrender to the claims of natural appetite, self-indulgence, self-absorption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>and self-idolatry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>By their very posture of mind, as seekers of the new, the <name>Transcendentalists</name> were critics and <q direct="unspecified">come-outers</q> from the old. Neither the church, the state, the college, society, nor even reform associations, had a hold upon their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>The past might be well enough for those who, without make-belief, could yet put faith in common dogmas and usages; but for them the matin-bells of a new day were chiming, and the herald-trump of freedom was heard upon the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>Hence, leaving ecclesiastical organizations, political parties, and familiar circles, which to them were brown with drought, they sought in covert nooks of friendship for running waters, and fruit from the tree of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>The journal, the letter, became of greater worth than the printed page; for they felt that systematic results were not yet to be looked for, and that in sallies of conjecture, glimpses and flights of ecstasy, the <q direct="unspecified">Newness</q> lifted her veil to her votaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>Thus, by mere attraction of affinity, grew together the brotherhood of the <q direct="unspecified">Like-minded,</q> as they were pleasantly nicknamed by outsiders, and by themselves, on the ground that no <num value="2">two</num> were of the same opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4376"/>The only password of membership to this association, which had no compact, records, or officers, was a hopeful and liberal spirit; and its chance conventions were determined merely by the desire of the caller for a <q direct="unspecified">talk,</q> or by the arrival of some guest from a distance with a budget of presumptive novelties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4377"/>Its <q direct="unspecified">symposium</q> was a pic-nic, <pb id="p.2015" n="2015"/> whereto each brought of his gains, as he felt prompted, a bunch of wild grapes from the woods, or bread-corn from his threshing-floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4378"/>The tone of the assemblies was cordial welcome for every <num value="1">one</num>'s peculiarity; and scholars, farmers, mechanics, merchants, married women, and maidens, met there on a level of courteous respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4379"/>The only guest not tolerated was intolerance; though strict justice might add, that these <q direct="unspecified">Illuminati</q> were as unconscious of their special cant as smokers are of the perfume of their weed, and that a professed declaration of universal independence turned out in practice to be rather oligarchic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4380"/>Of the class of persons most frequently found at these meetings <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> has left the following sketch:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4382"/>But many there are, who, adhering to the faith of the soul with that unusual earnestness which the world calls <q direct="unspecified">mad,</q> can answer their critics only by the eloquence of their characters and lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4383"/>Now, the other day, while visiting a person whose highest merit, so far as I know, is to save his pennies, I was astounded by hearing him allude to some of most approved worth among us, thus: <q direct="unspecified">You know <hi rend="italics">we</hi> consider <hi rend="italics">those men</hi> insane.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4384"/></p> 
<p>What this meant, I could not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> well guess, so completely was my scale of character turned topsyturvy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4385"/>But revolving the subject afterward, I perceived that we was the multiple of <persName n="Festus,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02015.00985" reg="mostcommon:Festus,Philip,,,:1"><surname>Festus</surname></persName>, and those men of <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02015.00986" reg="mostcommon:Paul,Jean,,,:2"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4386"/>All the circumstances seemed the same as in that <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 10" reg="Suriyah,Asia">Syrian</placeName> hall; for the persons in question were they <pb id="p.2016" n="2016"/> who cared more for doing good than for fortune and success,&mdash;more for the <num value="1">one</num> risen from the dead than for fleshly life,&mdash;more for the <name>Being</name> in whom we live and move than for <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Agrippa</foreName></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4387"/>Among this band of candidates for the mad-house, I found the young poet who valued insight of nature's beauty, and the power of chanting to his fellow-men a heavenly music, above the prospect of fortune, political power, or a standing in fashionable society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4388"/>At the division of the goods of this earth, he was wandering like <persName n="Schiller,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02016.00987" reg="mostcommon:Schiller,nomatch:0"><surname>Schiller</surname></persName>'s poet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4389"/>But the difference between American and <name>German</name> regulations would seem to be, that in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> the poet, when not <q direct="unspecified">with Jove,</q> is left at peace on earth; while here he is, by a self-constituted police, declared <q direct="unspecified">mad.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4390"/></p> 
<p>Another of this band was the young girl who, early taking a solemn view of the duties of life, found it difficult to serve an apprenticeship to its follies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4391"/>She could not turn her sweetness into <q direct="unspecified">manner,</q> nor cultivate love of approbation at the expense of virginity of heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4392"/>In so called society she found no outlet for her truest, fairest self, and so preferred to live with external nature, a few friends, her pencil, instrument, and books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4393"/>She, they say, is <q direct="unspecified">mad.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4394"/></p> 
<p>And he, the enthusiast for reform, who gives away fortune, standing in the world, peace, and only not life because bigotry is now afraid to exact the pound of flesh as well as the ducats,&mdash;he, whose heart beats high with hopes for the welfare of his race, is <q direct="unspecified">mad.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4395"/></p> 
<p>And he, the philosopher, who does not tie down his speculation to the banner of the day, but lets the wings of his thought upbear him where they will, as if they were stronger and surer than the balloon let off for the <pb id="p.2017" n="2017"/> amusement of the populace,&mdash;he must be <q direct="unspecified">mad.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>Amidst these meetings of the <name>Transcendentalists</name> it was, that, after years of separation, I again found <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4413"/>Of this body she was member by grace of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4414"/>Her romantic freshness of heart, her craving for the truth, her self-trust, had prepared her from childhood to be a pioneer in prairie-land; and her discipline in <name>German</name> schools had given definite form and tendency to her idealism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4415"/>Her critical yet aspiring intellect filled her with longing for germs of positive affirmation in place of the chaff of thrice-sifted negation; while her aesthetic instinct responded in accord to the praise of Beauty as the beloved heir of Good and Truth, whose right it is to reign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4416"/>On the other hand, strong common-sense saved her from becoming visionary, while she was too wellread as a scholar to be caught by conceits, and had been too sternly tried by sorrow to fall into fanciful effeminacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4417"/>It was a pleasing surprise to see how this friend of earlier days was acknowledged as a peer of the realm, in this new world of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4418"/>Men,&mdash;her superiors in years, fame and social position,&mdash;treated her more with the frankness due from equal to equal, than the halfcondescending deference with which scholars are wont to adapt themselves to women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4419"/>They did not talk down o her standard, nor translate their dialect into popular <pb id="p.2019" n="2019"/> phrase, but trusted to her power of interpretation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4420"/>It was evident that they prized her verdict, respected her criticism, feared her rebuke, and looked to her as an umpire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>Very observable was it, also, how, in sidetalks with her, they became confidential, seemed to glow and brighten into their best mood, and poured out in full measure what they but scantily hinted in the circle at large.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>Genius.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4423"/>it was quite a study to watch the phases through which <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> passed, in <num value="1">one</num> of these assemblies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4424"/>There was something in the air and step with which she chose her place in the company, betokening an instinctive sense, that, in intellect, she was of blood royal and needed to ask no favors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>And then she slowly gathered her attention to take in the significance of the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4426"/>Near-sighted and habitually using an eye-glass, she rapidly scanned the forms and faces, pausing intently where the expression of particular heads or groups suggested thought, and ending her survey with some apt home-thrust to her next neighbors, as if to establish full <hi rend="italics">rapport</hi>, and so to become a medium for the circulating life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4427"/>Only when thus in magnetic relations with all present, by a clear impress of their state and place, did she seem prepared to rise to a higher stage of communion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4428"/>Then she listened, with ear finely vibrating to every tone, with all capacities responsive in sympathy, with a swift and ductile power of appreciation, that made her feel to the quick the varying moods of different speakers, and yet the while <pb id="p.2020" n="2020"/> with coolest self-possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4429"/>Now and then a slight smile, flickering over her countenance, as lightning plays on the surface of a cloud, marked the inward process whereby she was harmonizing in equilibrium opposing thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4430"/>And, as occasion offered, a felicitous quotation, pungent apothegm, or symbolic epithet, dropped unawares in undertone, showed how swiftly scattered rays were brought in her mind to a focus.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4431"/>When her turn came, by a graceful transition she resumed the subject where preceding speakers had left it, and, briefly summing up their results, proceeded to unfold her own view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4432"/>Her opening was deliberate, like the progress of some massive force gaining its momentum; but as she felt her way, and moving in a congenial element, the sweep of her speech became grand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4433"/>The style of her eloquence was sententious, free from prettiness, direct, vigorous, charged with vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4434"/>Articulateness, just emphasis and varied accent, brought out most delicate shades and brilliant points of meaning, while a rhythmical collocation of words gave a finished form to every thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4435"/>She was affluent in historic illustration and literary allusion, as well as in novel hints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4436"/>She knew how to concentrate into racy phrases the essential truth gathered from wide research, and distilled with patient toil; and by skilful treatment she could make green again the wastes of commonplace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4437"/>Her statements, however rapid, showed breadth of comprehension, ready memory, impartial judgment, nice analysis of differences, power of penetrating through surfaces to realities, fixed regard to central laws and habitual communion with the <name>Life</name> of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4438"/>Critics, indeed, might have been tempted to sneer at a certain oracular grandiloquence, that bore away her soberness <pb id="p.2021" n="2021"/> in moments of elation; though even the most captious must presently have smiled at the humor of her descriptive touches, her dexterous exposure of folly and pretension, the swift stroke of her bright wit, her shrewd discernment, promptitude, and presence of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4439"/>The reverential, too, might have been pained at the sternness wherewith popular men, measures, and established customs, were tried and found guilty, at her tribunal; but even while blaming her aspirations as rash, revolutionary and impractical, no honest conservative could fail to recognize the sincerity of her aim. And every deep observer of character would have found the explanation of what seemed vehement or too highstrung, in the longing of a spirited woman to break every trammel that checked her growth or fettered her movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4573"/>Next, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> spoke of the friends whose generosity had provided the decorations on her walls, and the illustrated books for her table,&mdash;friends who were fellowstudents in art, history, or science,&mdash;friends whose very life she shared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4574"/>Her heart seemed full to overflow with sympathy for their joys and sorrows, their special trials and struggles, their peculiar tendencies of character and respective relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4575"/>The existence of each was to her a sacred process, whose developments she watched with awe, and whose leadings she reverently sought to aid. She had scores of pretty anecdotes to tell, sweet bowers of sentiment to open, significant lessons of experience to interpret, and scraps of journals or letters to read aloud, as the speediest means of introducing me to her chosen circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4576"/>There was a fascinating spell in her piquant descriptions, and a genial glow of sympathy animated to characteristic movement the figures, who in varying pantomime replaced <num value="1">one</num> another on the theatre of her fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4577"/>Frost-bound <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> melted into a dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4579"/>Sticklers for propriety might have found fault at the freedom with which she confided her friends' histories to <num value="1">one</num> who was a comparative stranger to them; but I could not but note how conscientiousness reined in her sensibilities and curbed their career, as they reached the due bounds of privacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4580"/>She did but realize <num value="1">one</num>'s conception of the transparent truthfulness that will pervade advanced societies of the future, where the very atmosphere shall behonorable faith.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4581"/>Nearer and nearer <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was approaching a secret throned in her heart that day; and the preceding transitions were but a prelude of her orchestra before the entrance of the festal group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4582"/>Unconsciously she made these preparations for paying worthy honors to a high sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4583"/>She had lately heard of the betrothal of <num value="2">two</num> of her best-loved friends; and she wished to communicate the graceful story in a way that should do justice to the facts and to her own feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4584"/>It was by a spontaneous impulse of her genius, and with no voluntary foreshaping, that she had grouped the previous tales; but no drama could have been more artistically constructed than the steps whereby she led me onward to the denouement; and the look, tone, words, with which she told it, were fluent with melody as the song of an improvisatrice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4585"/>Scarcely had she finished, when, offering some light refreshment,&mdash;as it was now past noon,&mdash;she proposed a walk in the open air. She led the way to <persName n="Bussey,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02034.01004" reg="mostcommon:Bussey,nomatch:0"><surname>Bussey</surname></persName>'s wood, her favorite retreat during the past year, where she had thought and read, or talked with intimate friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4586"/>We climbed the rocky path, resting a moment or <num value="2">two</num> at very pretty point, till, reaching a moss-cushioned ledge near the summit, she seated herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4587"/>For a time she was <pb id="p.2035" n="2035"/> silent, entranced in delighted communion with the exquisite hue of the sky, seen through interlacing boughs and trembling leaves, and the play of shine and shadow over the wide landscape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4588"/>But soon, arousing from her reverie, she took up the thread of the morning's talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4589"/>My part was to listen; for I was absorbed in contemplating this, to me, quite novel form of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4590"/>It has been seen how my early distaste for <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s society was gradually changed to admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4591"/>Like all her friends, I had passed through an avenue of sphinxes before reaching the temple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4592"/>But now it appeared that thus far I had never been admitted to the adytum.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4593"/>As, leaning on <num value="1">one</num> arm, she poured out her stream of thought, turning now and then her eyes full upon me, to see whether I caught her meaning, there was leisure to study her thoroughly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4594"/>Her temperament was predominantly what the physiologists would call nervoussanguine; and the gray eye, rich brown hair and light complexion, with the muscular and well-developed frame, bespoke delicacy balanced by vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4595"/>Here was a sensitive yet powerful being, fit at once for rapture or sustained effort, intensely active, prompt for adventure, firm for trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4596"/>She certainly had not beauty; yet the high arched dome of the head, the changeful expressiveness of every feature, and her whole air of mingled dignity and impulse, gave her a commanding charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4597"/>Especially characteristic were <num value="2">two</num> physical traits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4598"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was a contraction of the eyelids almost to a point,&mdash;a trick caught from near-sightedness,&mdash;and then a sudden dilation, till the iris seemed to emit flashes;&mdash;an effect, no doubt; dependent on her highly-magnetized condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4599"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> was a singular pliancy of the vertebra and muscles of the neck, enabling her by a mere movement <pb id="p.2036" n="2036"/> to denote each varying emotion; in moments of tenderness, or pensive feeling, its curves were swan-like in grace, but when she was scornful or indignant it contracted, and made swift turns like that of a bird of prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4600"/>Finally, in the animation, yet <hi rend="italics">abandon</hi> of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s attitude and look, were rarely blended the fiery force of northern, and the soft languor of southern races.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4601"/>Meantime, as I was thus, through her physiognomy, tracing the outlines of her spiritual form, she was narrating chapters from the book of experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4602"/>How superficially, heretofore, had I known her!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4603"/>We had met chiefly as scholars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4604"/>But now I saw before me <num value="1">one</num> whose whole life had been a poem,&mdash;of boundless aspiration and hope almost wild in its daring,&mdash;of indomitable effort amidst poignant disappointment,&mdash;of widest range, yet persistent unity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4605"/>Yes! here was a poet in deed, a true worshipper of <persName n="Apollo,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02036.01005" reg="mostcommon:Apollo,nomatch:0"><surname>Apollo</surname></persName>, who had steadfastly striven to brighten and make glad existence, to harmonize all jarring and discordant strings, to fuse most hard conditions and cast them in a symmetric mould, to piece fragmentary fortunes into a mosaic symbol of heavenly order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4606"/>Here was <num value="1">one</num>, fond as a child of joy, eager as a native of the tropics for swift transition from luxurious rest to passionate excitement, prodigal to pour her mingled force of will, thought, sentiment, into the life of the moment, all radiant with imagination, longing for communion with artists of every age in their inspired hours, fitted by genius and culture to mingle as an equal in the most refined circles of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and yet her youth and early womanhood had passed away amid the very decent, yet drudging, descendants of the prim Puritans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4607"/>Trained among those who could have discerned her peculiar power, and early fed with the fruits of beauty for which <pb id="p.2037" n="2037"/> her spirit pined, she would have developed into <num value="1">one</num> of the finest lyrists, romancers and critics, that the modern literary world has seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4608"/>This she knew; and this tantalization of her fate she keenly felt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4609"/>But the tragedy of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s history was deeper yet. Behind the poet was the woman,&mdash;the fond and relying, the heroic and disinterested woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4610"/>The very glow of her poetic enthusiasm was but an outflush of trustful affection; the very restlessness of her intellect was the confession that her heart had found no home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4611"/>A <q direct="unspecified">bookworm,</q> <q direct="unspecified">a dilettante,</q> <q direct="unspecified">a pedant,</q> I had heard her sneeringly called; but now it was evident that her seeming insensibility was virgin pride, and her absorption in study the natural vent of emotions, which had met no object worthy of life-long attachment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4612"/>At once, many of her peculiarities became intelligible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4613"/>Fitfulness, unlooked&mdash;for changes of mood, misconceptions of words and actions, substitution of fancy for fact,&mdash;which had annoyed me during the previous season, as inconsistent in a person of such capacious judgment and sustained selfgovern-ment,&mdash;were now referred to the morbid influence of affections pent up to prey upon themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4614"/>And, what was still more interesting, the clue was given to a singular credulousness, by which, in spite of her unusual penetration, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> might be led away blindfold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4615"/>As this revelation of her ardent nature burst upon me, and as, rapidly recalling the past, I saw how faithful she had kept to her high purposes,&mdash;how patient, gentle, and thoughtful for others, how active in self-improvement and usefulness, how wisely dignified she had been,&mdash;I could not but bow to her in reverence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4616"/>We walked back to the house amid a rosy sunset, and it was with no surprise that I heard her complain of an <pb id="p.2038" n="2038"/> agonizing nervous headache, which compelled her at once to retire, and call for assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4617"/>As for myself, while going homeward, I reflected with astonishment on the unflagging spiritual energy with which, for hour after hour, she had swept over lands and seas of thought, and, as my own excitement cooled, I became conscious of exhaustion, as if a week's life had been concentrated in a day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4618"/>The interview, thus hastily sketched, may serve as a fair type of our usual intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>Always I found her open-eyed to beauty, fresh for wonder, with wings poised for flight, and fanning the coming breeze of inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>Always she seemed to see before her,&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="pentameter"><l>A shape all light, which with <num value="1">one</num> hand did fling</l> <l>Dew on the earth, as if she were the dawn,</l> <l>And the invisible rain did ever sing</l> <l>A silver music on the mossy lawn.</l></lg></quote> Yet more and more distinctly did I catch a plaintive tone of sorrow in her thought and speech, like the wail of an Aeolian harp heard at intervals from some upper window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>She had never met <num value="1">one</num> who could love her as she could love; and in the orange-grove of her affections the white, perfumed blossoms and golden fruit wasted away unclaimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>Through the mask of slight personal defects and ungraceful manners, of superficial hauteur and egotism, and occasional extravagance of sentiment, no equal had recognized the rare beauty of her spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>She was yet alone.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4764"/>I looked at it till my feelings became so strong that I longed to share it. The thought which filled my mind was that here we saw the type of pure feminine beauty in the moon's own flower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5014"/>I was greatly disappointed in my relation to him. I was, indeed, always called on to be worthy,&mdash;this benefit was sure in our friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5015"/>But I found no intelligence of my best self; far less was it revealed to me in new modes; for not only did he seem to want the living faith which enables <num value="1">one</num> to discharge this holiest office of a friend, but he absolutely distrusted me in every region of my life with which he was unacquainted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5016"/>The same trait I detected in his relations with others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5017"/>He had faith in the <name>Universal</name>, but not in the <rs>Individual Man</rs>; he met men, not as a brother, but as a critic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5018"/>Philosophy appeared to chill instead of exalting the poet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5019"/>But now I am better acquainted with him. His <pb id="p.2068" n="2068"/> <q direct="unspecified">accept</q> is true; the <q direct="unspecified">I shall learn,</q> with which he answers every accusation, is no less true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5020"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can feel his limitations, in fact, more than he, though he always speaks confidently from his present knowledge as all he has yet, and never qualifies or explains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5021"/>He feels himself <q direct="unspecified">shut up in a crystal cell,</q> from which only <q direct="unspecified">a great love or a great task could release me,</q> and hardly expects either from what remains in this life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5022"/>But I already see so well how these limitations have fitted him for his peculiar work, that I can no longer quarrel with them; while from his eyes looks out the angel that must sooner or later break every chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5023"/>Leave him in his cell affirming absolute truth; protesting against humanity, if so he appears to do; the calm observer of the courses of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5024"/>Surely, <q direct="unspecified">he keeps true to his thought, which is the great matter.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5025"/>He has already paid his debt to his time; how much more he will give we cannot know; but already I feel how invaluable is a cool mind, like his, amid the warring elements around us. As I look at him more by his own law, I understand him better; and as I understand him better, differences melt away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5026"/>My inmost heart blesses the fate that gave me birth in the same clime and time, and that has drawn me into such a close bond with him as, it is my hopeful faith, will never be broken, but from sphere to sphere ever more hallowed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5027"/>What did you mean by saying I had imbibed much of his way of thought?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5028"/>I do indeed feel his life stealing gradually into mine; and I sometimes think that my work would have been more simple, and my unfolding to a temporal activity more rapid and easy, if we had never met.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>The present object is to give ourselves and others a tolerable chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/>Let us not be too ambitious in our hopes as to immediate results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>Our lives should be considered as a tendency, an approximation only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>Parents and teachers expect to do too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>They are not legislators, but only interpreters to the next generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>Soon, very soon, does the parent become merely the elder brother of his child;&mdash;a little wiser, it is to be hoped. &mdash;&mdash;Differed from me as to some things I said about the gradations of experience,&mdash;that <q direct="unspecified">to be brought prematurely near perfect beings would chill and discourage.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>He thought it would cheer and console.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>He spoke well,&mdash; with a youthful nobleness. &mdash;&mdash;said <q direct="unspecified">that the most perfect person would be the most impersonal</q>&mdash;philosophical bull that, I trow&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">and, consequently, would impede us least from <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> R. spoke admirably on the nature of loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>The people showed a good deal of the <hi rend="italics">sans-culotte</hi> tendency in their manners,&mdash; throwing themselves on the floor, yawning, and going out when they had heard enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>Yet, as the majority differ from me, to begin with,&mdash;that being the reason this subject was chosen,&mdash;they showed, on the whole, more respect and interest than I had expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>As I <pb id="p.2075" n="2075"/> am accustomed to deference, however, and need it for the boldness and animation which my part requires, I did not speak with as much force as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5102"/>Still, I should like to have to face all this; it would have the same good effects that the <name>Athenian</name> assemblies had on the minds obliged to encounter them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/>I was out all the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/>In the afternoon, <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> R. and I had a talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/>I said my position would be too uncertain here, as I could not work. &mdash;&mdash; said:&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">They would all like to work for a person of genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>They would not like to have this service claimed from them, but would like to render it of their own accord.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/><q direct="unspecified">Yes,</q> I told her; <q direct="unspecified">but where would be my repose, when they were always to be judging whether I was worth it or not. It would be the same position the clergyman is in, or the wandering beggar with his harp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5109"/>Each day you must prove yourself anew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5110"/>You are not in immediate relations with material things.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/></p> 
<p>We talked of the principles of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5112"/>I said I had not a right to come, because all the confidence in it I had was as an <hi rend="italics">experiment</hi> worth trying, and that it was a part of the great wave of inspired thought. &mdash;&mdash;declared they none of them had confidence beyond this; but they seem to me to have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5113"/>Then I said, <q direct="unspecified">that though I entirely agreed about the dignity of labor, and had always wished for the present change, yet I did not agree with the principle of paying for services by time;<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5117"/>Afternoon, out with the drawing party; I felt the evils of want of conventional refinement, in the impudence with which <num value="1">one</num> of the girls treated me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5129"/>In the evening, a conversation on Impulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5130"/>The reason for choosing this subject is the great tendency <pb id="p.2077" n="2077"/> here to advocate spontaneousness, at the expense of reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5131"/>It was a much better conversation than the <num value="1">one</num> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5132"/>None yawned, for none came, this time, from mere curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5133"/>There were about <num value="35">thirty-five</num> present, which is a large enough circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5134"/>Many engaged in the talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5143"/>Truly, the soft answer turneth away wrath.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>I have found myself here in the amusing position of a conservative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5145"/>Even so is it with <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> R. There are too many young people in proportion to the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>The tone of the society is much sweeter than when I was here a year ago. There is a pervading spirit of mutual tolerance and gentleness, with great sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>There is no longer a passion for grotesque freaks of liberty, but a disposition, rather, to study and enjoy the liberty of law. The great development of mind and character observable in several instances, persuades me that this state of things affords a fine studio for the soul-sculptor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>To a casual observer it may seem as if there was not enough of character here to interest, because there are no figures sufficiently distinguished to be worth painting for the crowd; but there is enough of individuality in free play to yield instruction; and <num value="1">one</num> might have, from a few months' residence here, enough of the human drama to feed thought for a long time.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5153"/>What influence she in turn exerted on those she met there, may be seen from the following affectionate tribute, offered by <num value="1">one</num> of the young girls alluded to in the journal:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/></p> 
<p>Would that I might aid, even slightly, in doing justice to the noble-hearted woman whose departure we must all mourn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>But I feel myself wholly powerless to do so; and after I explain what my relation to her was <pb id="p.2079" n="2079"/> you will understand how this can be, without holding me indolent or unsympathetic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met <persName n="Fuller,Miss,,,," id="n0234.0008.02079.01061" reg="nearbymention:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, I had already cut from my moorings, and was sailing on the broad sea of experience, conscious that I possessed unusual powers of endurance, and that I should meet with sufficient to test their strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>She made no offer of guidance, and once or twice, in the succeeding year, alluded to the fact that she <quote>had never helped me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>This was in a particular sense, of course, for she helped all who knew her. She was interested in my rough history, but could not be intimate, in any just sense, with a soul so unbalanced, so inharmonious as mine then was. For my part, I reverenced her. She was to me the embodiment of wisdom and tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5159"/>I heard her converse, and, in the rich and varied intonations of her voice, I recognized a being to whom every shade of sentiment was familiar, She knew, if not by experience then by no questionable intuition, how to interpret the inner life of every man and woman; and, by interpreting, she could soothe and strengthen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5160"/>To her, psychology was an open book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5161"/>When she came to <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName>, it was my delight to wait on <num value="1">one</num> so worthy of all service,&mdash;to arrange her late breakfast in some remnants of ancient <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>, and to save her, if it might be, some little fatigue or annoyance, during each day. After a while she seemed to lose sight of my more prominent and disagreeable peculiarities, and treated me with affectionate regard.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5162"/>Being a confirmed Socialist, I often had occasion to discuss with <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> the problems involved in the <q direct="unspecified">Combined Order</q> of life; and though unmoved by her scepticism, I could not but admire the sagacity, foresight, <pb id="p.2080" n="2080"/> comprehensiveness, and catholic sympathy with which she surveyed this complicated subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>Her objections, to be sure, were of the usual kind, and turned mainly upon <num value="2">two</num> points,&mdash;the difficulty of so allying labor and capital as to secure the hoped &mdash; for cooperation, and the danger of merging the individual in the mass to such degree as to paralyze energy, heroism, and genius; but these objections were urged in a way that brought out her originality and generous hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/>There was nothing abject, timid, or conventional in her doubts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5165"/>The end sought she prized; but the means she questioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5166"/>Though pleased in listening to sanguine visions of the future, she was slow to credit that an organization by <q direct="unspecified">Groups and Series</q> would yield due incentive for personal development, while ensuring equilibrium through exact and universal justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/>She felt, too, that Society was not a machine to be put together and set in motion, but a living body, whose breath must be Divine inspiration, and whose healthful growth is only hindered by forcing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>Finally, while longing as earnestly as any Socialist for <q direct="unspecified">Liberty and Law made <num value="1">one</num> in living union,</q> and assured in faith that an era was coming of <q direct="unspecified">Attractive Industry</q> and <q direct="unspecified">Harmony,</q> she was still for herself inclined to seek sovereign independence in comparative isolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>Indeed, at this period, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was in spirit and in thought preeminently a Transcendentalist.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.8.71" type="section" n="c.8.71"> 
<head>Ix.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/>Credo.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>in regard to Transcendentalism again, there was reason to rejoice in having found a friend, so firm to keep <pb id="p.2081" n="2081"/> her own ground, while so liberal to comprehend another's stand-point, as was <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5172"/>She knew, not only theoretically, but practically, how endless are the diversities of human character and of Divine discipline, and she reverenced fellow-spirits too sincerely ever to wish to warp them to her will, or to repress their normal development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5173"/>She was stern but in <num value="1">one</num> claim, that each should be faithful to apparent leadings of the <name>Truth</name>; and could avow widest differences of conviction without feeling that love was thereby chilled, or the hand withheld from cordial aid. Especially did she render service by enabling <num value="1">one</num>,&mdash;through her blended insight, candor, and clearness of understanding,&mdash;to see in bright reflection his own mental state.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5174"/>It would be doing injustice to a person like <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, always more enthusiastic than philosophical, to attribute to her anything like a system of theology; for, hopeful, reverent, aspiring, and free from scepticism, she felt too profoundly the vastness of the universe and of destiny ever to presume that with her span rule she could measure the <name>Infinite</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5175"/>Yet the tendency of her thoughts can readily be traced in the following passages from note-books and letters:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5176"/>When others say to me, and not without apparent ground, that <q direct="unspecified">the <rs type="place">Outward Church</rs> is a folly which keeps men from enjoying the communion of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> Invisible, and that in the desire to be helped by, and to help others, men lose sight of the only sufficient help, which they might find by faithful solitary intentness of spirit,</q> I answer it is true, and the present deadness and emptiness summon us to turn our thoughts in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5177"/>Being now without <pb id="p.2082" n="2082"/> any positive form of religion, any unattractive symbols, or mysterious rites, we are in the less danger of stopping at surfaces, of accepting a mediator instead of the <rs>Father</rs>, a sacrament instead of the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5178"/>And when I see how little there is to impede and bewilder us, I cannot but accept,&mdash;should it be for many years,&mdash;the forlornness, the want of fit expression, the darkness as to what is to be expressed, even that characterize our time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5179"/>But I do not, therefore, as some of our friends do, believe that it will always be so, and that the church is tottering to its grave, never to rise again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5180"/>The church was the growth of human nature, and it is so still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5181"/>It is but <num value="1">one</num> result of the impulse which makes <num value="2">two</num> friends clasp <num value="1">one</num> another's hands, look into <num value="1">one</num> another's eyes at sight of beauty, or the utterance of a feeling of piety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5182"/>So soon as the <name>Spirit</name> has mourned and sought, and waited long enough to open new depths, and has found something to express, there will again be a Cultus, a Church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5183"/>The very people, who say that none is needed, make <num value="1">one</num> at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5184"/>They talk with, they write to <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5185"/>They listen to music, they sustain themselves with the poets; they like that <num value="1">one</num> voice should tell the thoughts of several minds, <num value="1">one</num> gesture proclaim that the same life is at the same moment in many breasts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5186"/>I am myself most happy in my lonely <date value="--7">Sundays</date>, and do not feel the need of any social worship, as I have not for several years, which I have passed in the same way. Sunday is to me priceless as a day of peace and solitary reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5190"/>After much troubling of the waters of my life, a radiant thought of the meaning and beauty of earthly existence will descend like a healing angel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5191"/>The stillness permits me to hear a pure tone from the <num value="1">One</num> in All. But often I am not alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5192"/>The many now, whose hearts, panting for truth and love, have been made known to me, whose lives flow in the same direction as mine, and are enlightened by the same star, are with me. I am in church, the church invisible, undefiled by inadequate expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5193"/>Our communion is perfect; it is that of a common aspiration; and where <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> are gathered together in <num value="1">one</num> region, whether in the flesh or the spirit, He will grant their request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5194"/>Other communion would be a happiness,&mdash;to break together the bread of mutual thought, to drink the wine of loving life,&mdash;but it is not necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5195"/>Yet I cannot but feel that the crowd of men whose pursuits are not intellectual, who are not brought by their daily walk into converse with sages and poets, who win their bread from an earth whose mysteries are not open to them, whose worldly intercourse is more likely to stifle than to encourage the sparks of love and faith in their breasts, need on that day quickening more than repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5196"/>The church is now rather a lecture-room than a place of worship; it should be a school for mutual instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5197"/>I must rejoice when any <num value="1">one</num>, who lays spiritual things to <pb id="p.2084" n="2084"/> heart, feels the call rather to mingle with men, than to retire and seek by himself.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5200"/>No doubt this is wrong, since the sign does not stand for the thing signified, but it is <num value="1">one</num> feature of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5212"/>This Unitarianism has had its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5525"/>Constant experience, too, of the wonderful <pb id="p.2109" n="2109"/> modes whereby her fate was shaped by overruling mercy, had chastened her love of personal sway, and her passion for a commanding career; and <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> could humble herself,&mdash;did often humble herself, with an all-resigning contrition, that was most touching to witness in <num value="1">one</num> naturally so haughty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5526"/>Of this the following letter to a valued friend gives illustration:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5527"/>I ought, I know, to have laid aside my own cares and griefs, been on the alert for intelligence that would gratify you, and written letters such as would have been of use and given pleasure to my wise, tender, ever faithful friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5528"/>But no; I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intruded on your happiness with my sorrowful epistles, and then, because you did not seem to understand my position, with sullen petulance I resolved to write no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5530"/></p> 
<p>It was a bad omen that I lost the locket you gave me, which I had constantly worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5531"/>Had that been daily before my eyes, to remind me of all your worth, &mdash;of the generosity with which you, a ripe and wise character, received me to the privileges of equal friendship; of the sincerity with which you reproved and the love with which you pardoned my faults; of how much :you taught me, and bore with from me,&mdash;it would have softened the flint of my heart, and I should have relaxed from my isolation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5532"/>How shall I apologize for feelings which I now recognize as having been so cold, so bitter and unjust?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5533"/>I can only say I have suffered greatly, till the tone of my spirits seems destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5535"/>Yet, if you can forgive, I will try to forgive myself, and I do think I shall never so deeply sin again.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5536"/>Yet, though thus frank to own to herself and to her peers her errors, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> cherished a trust in her powers, a confidence in her destiny, and an ideal of her being, place and influence, so lofty as to be extravagant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5537"/>In the morning-hour and mountain-air of aspiration, her shadow moved before her, of gigantic size, upon the snow-white vapor.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5541"/>Exaggeration, if you will; but not determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5542"/>No; I would have all open to the light, and would let my boughs be pruned, when they grow rank and unfruitful, even if I felt the knife to the quick of my being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5551"/>Again, she says:&mdash;<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5552"/>I like to hear you express your sense of my defects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5553"/>The word <q direct="unspecified">arrogance</q> does not, indeed, appear to me to be just; probably because I do not understand what you mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5554"/>But in due time I doubtless shall; for so repeatedly have you used it, that it must stand for something real in my large and rich, yet irregular and unclarified nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5555"/>But though I like to hear you, as I say, and think somehow your reproof does me good, by myself, I return to my native bias, and feel as if there was plenty of room in the universe for my faults, and as if I could not spend time in thinking of them, when so many things interest me more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5556"/>I have no defiance or coldness, however, as to these spiritual facts which I do not know; but I must follow my own law, and bide my time, even if, like <persName n="Oedipus,,,,," id="n0234.0008.02111.01098" reg="mostcommon:Oedipus,nomatch:0"><surname>Oedipus</surname></persName>, I should return a criminal, blind and outcast, to ask aid from the gods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5557"/>Such possibilities, I confess, give me great awe; for I have more sense than most, of the tragic depths that may open suddenly in the life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5558"/>Yet, believing in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, anguish cannot be despair, nor guilt perdition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5559"/>I fcel sure that I have never wilfully chosen, and that my life has been docile to such truth as was shown it. In an environment like mine, what may have seemed too lofty or ambitious in my character was absolutely <pb id="p.2112" n="2112"/> needed to keep the heart from breaking and enthusiasm from extinction.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5560"/>Such Egoism as this, though lacking the angel grace of unconsciousness, has a stoical grandeur that commands respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5561"/>Indeed, in all that <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> spoke, wrote, or did, no cynic could detect the taint of meanness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5562"/>Her elation came not from opium fumes of vanity, inhaled in close chambers of conceit, but from the stimulus of sunshine, fresh breezes, and swift movement upon the winged steed of poesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5563"/>Her existence was bright with romantic interest to herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5564"/>There was an amplitude and elevation in her aim, which were worthy, as she felt, of human honor and of heavenly aid; and she was buoyed up by a courageous good-will, amidst all evils, that she knew would have been recognized as heroic in the chivalric times, when <q direct="unspecified">every morning brought a noble chance.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5565"/>Neither was her self-regard of an engrossing temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5566"/>On the contrary, the sense of personal dignity taught her the worth of the lowliest human being, and her intense desire for harmonious conditions quickened a boundless compassion for the squalid, downcast, and drudging multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5567"/>She aspired to live in majestic fulness of benignant and joyful activity, leaving a track of light with every footstep; and, like the radiant <rs>Iduna</rs>, bearing to man the golden apples of immortality, she would have made each meeting with her fellows rich with some boon that should never fade, but brighten in bloom forever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5568"/>This characteristic self-esteem determined the quality of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s influence, which was singularly penetrating, and most beneficent where most deeply and continuously felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5569"/>Chance acquaintance with her, like a breath from the tropics, might have prematurely burst <pb id="p.2113" n="2113"/> the buds of feeling in sensitive hearts, leaving after blight and barrenness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5570"/>Natures, small in compass and of fragile substance, might have been distorted and shattered by attempts to mould themselves on her grand model.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5571"/>And in her seeming unchartered impulses,&mdash; whose latent law was honorable integrity,&mdash;eccentric spirits might have found encouragement for capricious license.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5572"/>Her morbid subjectivity, too, might, by contagion, have affected others with undue selfconscious-ness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5573"/>And, finally, even intimate friends might have been tempted, by her flattering love, to exaggerate their own importance, until they recognized that her regard for them was but <num value="1">one</num> niche in a Pantheon at whose every shrine she offered incense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5574"/>But these ill effects were superficial accidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5575"/>The peculiarity of her power was to make all who were in concert with her feel the miracle of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5576"/>She lived herself with such concentrated force in the moments, that she was always effulgent with thought and affection,&mdash;with conscience, courage, resource, decision, a penetrating and forecasting wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>Hence, to associates, her presence seemed to touch even common scenes and drudging cares with splendor, as when, through the scud of a rain-storm, sunbeams break from serene blue openings, crowning familiar things with sudden glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5578"/>By manifold sympathies, yet central unity, she seemed in herself to be a goodly company, and her words and deeds imparted the virtue of a collective life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5579"/>So tender was her affection, that, like a guardian genius, she made her friends' souls her own, and identified herself with their fortunes: and yet, so pure and high withal was her justice, that, in her recognition of their past success and present claims, there came a summons for fresh endeavor <pb id="p.2114" n="2114"/> after the perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5580"/>The very thought of her roused manliness to emulate the vigorous freedom, with which <num value="1">one</num> was assured, that wherever placed she was that instant acting; and the mere mention of her name was an inspiration of magnanimity, and faithfulness, and truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5981"/>Yet, it was the suggestion of <persName n="Greeley,Mrs.,,,," id="n0234.0010.02153.01145" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>,&mdash;who had spent some weeks of successive seasons in or near <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and who had there made the personal acquaintance of <persName n="Fuller,Miss,,,," id="n0234.0010.02153.01146" reg="nearbymention:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, and formed a very high estimate and warm attachment for her,&mdash;that induced me, in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>, to offer her terms, which were accepted, for her assistance in the literary department of the <name>Tribune</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5982"/>A home in my family was included in the stipulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5983"/>I was myself barely acquainted with her, when she thus came to reside with us, and I did not fully appreciate her nobler qualities for some months afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5984"/>Though we were members of the same household, we scarcely met save at breakfast; and my time and thoughts were absorbed in duties and cares, which left me little leisure or inclination for the amenities of social intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5985"/>Fortune seemed to delight in placing us <num value="2">two</num> in relations of friendly antagonism,&mdash;or rather, to develop all possible contrasts in our ideas and social habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5986"/>She was naturally inclined to luxury and a good appearance before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5987"/>My pride, if I had any, delighted in bare walls and rugged fare She was addicted to strong tea and coffee, both which I rejected and contemned, even in the most hom$eopathic dilutions; while, my general health being sound, and hers sadly impaired, I could not fail to find in her dietetic habits the causes of her almost habitual illness; and once, while we were still barely acquainted, when she came to the breakfast-table with a very severe headache, I was tempted to attribute it to her strong potations of the <name>Chinese</name> leaf the night before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5988"/>She told me quite frankly that she <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5989"/>declined being lectured on <pb id="p.2154" n="2154"/> the food or beverage she saw fit to take;</p></quote> which was but reasonable in <num value="1">one</num> who had arrived at her maturity of intellect and fixedness of habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5990"/>So the subject was thenceforth tacitly avoided between us; but, though words were suppressed, looks and involuntary gestures could not so well be; and an utter divergency of views on this and kindred themes created a perceptible distance between us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5991"/>Her earlier contributions to the <name>Tribune</name> were not her best, and I did not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prize her aid so highly as I afterwards learned to do. She wrote always freshly, vigorously, but not always clearly; for her full and intimate acquaintance with continental literature, especially <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0234.0010.02154.01147" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>, seemed to have marred her felicity and readiness of expression in her mother tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5992"/>While I never met another woman who conversed more freely or lucidly, the attempt to commit her thoughts to paper seemed to induce a singular embarrassment and hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5993"/>She could write only when in the vein; and this needed often to be waited for through several days, while the occasion sometimes required an immediate utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5994"/>The new book must be reviewed before other journals had thoroughly dissected and discussed it, else the ablest critique would command no general attention, and perhaps be, by the greater number, unread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5995"/>That the writer should wait the flow of inspiration, or at least the recurrence of elasticity of spirits and relative health of body, will not seem unreasonable to the general reader; but to the inveterate hack-horse of the daily press, accustomed to write at any time, on any subject, and with a rapidity limited only by the physical ability to form the requisite pen-strokes, the notion of waiting for a brighter day, or a happier frame of <pb id="p.2155" n="2155"/> mind, appears fantastic and absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5996"/>He would as soon think of waiting for a change in the moon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5997"/>Hence, while I realized that her contributions evinced rare intellectual wealth and force, I did not value them as I should have done had they been written more fluently and promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5998"/>They often seemed to make their appearance <quote>a day after the fair.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5999"/><num value="1">One</num> other point of tacit antagonism between us may as well be noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6000"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was always a most earnest, devoted champion of the <name>Emancipation</name> of Women, from their past and present condition of inferiority, to an independence on Men. She demanded for them the fullest recognition of Social and Political Equality with the rougher sex; the freest access to all stations, professions, employments, which are open to any. To this demand I heartily acceded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6001"/>It seemed to me, however, that her clear perceptions of abstract right were often overborne, in practice, by the influence of education and habit; that while she demanded absolute equality for Woman, she exacted a deference and courtesy from men to women, <hi rend="italics">as</hi> women, which was entirely inconsistent with that requirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6002"/>In my view, the equalizing theory can be enforced only by ignoring the habitual discrimination of men and women, as forming separate <hi rend="italics">classes</hi>, and regarding all alike as simply <hi rend="italics">persons</hi>,&mdash;as human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6003"/>So long as a lady shall deem herself in need of some gentleman's arm to conduct her properly out of a dining or ball-room,&mdash;so long as she shall consider it dangerous or unbecoming to walk half a mile alone by night,&mdash;I cannot see how the <q direct="unspecified">Woman's Rights</q> theory is ever to be anything more than a logically defensible abstraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6004"/>In this view <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> did not at all concur, and the diversity <pb id="p.2156" n="2156"/> was the incitement to much perfectly good-natured, but nevertheless sharpish sparring between us. Whenever she said or did anything implying the usual demand of Woman on the courtesy and protection of Manhood, I was apt, before complying, to look her in the face and exclaim with marked emphasis,&mdash;quoting from her Woman in the <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> Century, <quote>&mdash;</quote> let them be sea-Captains if they will!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6005"/>Of course, this was given and received as raillery, but it did not tend to ripen our intimacy or quicken my esteem into admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6006"/>Though no unkind word ever passed between us, nor any approach to <num value="1">one</num>, yet we <num value="2">two</num> dwelt for months under the same roof, as scarcely more than acquaintances, meeting once a day at a common board, and having certain business relations with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6007"/>Personally, I regarded her rather as my wife's cherished friend than as my own, possessing many lofty qualities and some prominent weaknesses, and a good deal spoiled by the unmeasured flattery of her little circle of inordinate admirers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6008"/>For myself, burning no incense on any human shrine, I half-consciously resolved to <quote>keep my eye-beam clear,</quote> and escape the fascination which she seemed to exert over the eminent and cultivated persons, mainly women, who came to our outof-the-way dwelling to visit her, and who seemed generally to regard her with a strangely <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> adoration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6009"/>But as time wore on, and I became inevitably better and better acquainted with her, I found myself drawn, almost irresistibly, into the general current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6010"/>I found that her faults and weaknesses were all superficial and obvious to the most casual, if undazzled, observer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6011"/>They rather dwindled than expanded upon a fuller knowledge; or rather, took on new and brighter aspects <pb id="p.2157" n="2157"/> in the light of her radiant and lofty soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6012"/>I learned to know her as a most fearless and unselfish champion of Truth and Human Good at all hazards, ready to be their standard-bearer through danger and obloquy, and, if need be, their martyr.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6013"/>I think few have more keenly appreciated the material goods of life,&mdash;Rank, Riches, Power, Luxury, Enjoyment; but I know none who would have more cheerfully surrendered them all, if the well-being of our Race could thereby have been promoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6014"/>I have never met another in whom the inspiring hope of Immortality was so strengthened into profoundest conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>She did not <hi rend="italics">believe</hi> in our future and unending existence,&mdash;she <hi rend="italics">knew</hi> it, and lived ever in the broad glare of its morning twilight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>With a limited income and liberal wants, she was yet generous beyond the bounds of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6017"/>Had the gold of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> been all her own, she would have disbursed <num value="9">nine</num> <num value=".1">tenths</num> of it in eager and well-directed efforts to stay, or at least diminish, the flood of human misery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6018"/>And it is but fair to state, that the liberality she evinced was fully paralleled by the liberality she experienced at the hands of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6019"/>Had she needed <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and made her wants known, she had friends who would have cheerfully supplied her. I think few persons, in their pecuniary dealings, have experienced and evinced more of the better qualities of human nature than <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0234.0010.02157.01148" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6020"/>She seemed to inspire those who approached her with that generosity which was a part of her nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6021"/>Of her writings I do not purpose to speak critically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6022"/>I think most of her contributions to the <name>Tribune</name>, while she remained with us, were characterized by a directness, terseness, and practicality, which are wanting in <pb id="p.2158" n="2158"/> some of her earlier productions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6023"/>Good judges have confirmed my own opinion, that, while her essays in the <name>Dial</name> are more elaborate and ambitious, her reviews in tile Tribune are far better adapted to win the favor and sway the judgment of the great majority of readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6024"/>But, <num value="1">one</num> characteristic of her writings I feel bound to commend,&mdash;their absolute truthfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6025"/>She never asked how this would sound, nor whether that would do, nor what would be the effect of saying anything; but simply, <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6026"/>Is it the truth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6027"/>Is it such as the public should know?</p></quote> And if her judgment answered, <quote>Yes,</quote> she uttered it; no matter what turmoil it might excite, nor what odium it might draw down on her own head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6028"/>Perfect conscientiousness was an unfailing characteristic of her literary efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6029"/>Even the severest of her critiques, &mdash;that on <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0234.0010.02158.01149" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,nomatch:0"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s Poems,&mdash;for which an impulse in personal pique has been alleged, I happen with certainty to know had no such origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6030"/>When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> handed her the book to review, she excused herself, assigning the wide divergence of her views of Poetry from those of the author and his school, as her reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6031"/>She thus induced me to attempt the task of reviewing it myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6032"/>But day after day sped by, and I could find no hour that was not absolutely required for the performance of some duty that <hi rend="italics">would not</hi> be put off, nor turned over to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6033"/>At length I carried the book back to her in utter despair of ever finding an hour in which even to look through it; and, at my renewed and earnest request, she reluctantly undertook its discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6034"/>The statement of these facts is but an act of justice to her memory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6035"/>Profoundly religious,&mdash;though her creed was, at once, very broad and very short, with a genuine love <pb id="p.2159" n="2159"/> for inferiors in social position, whom she was habitually studying, by her counsel and teachings, to elevate and improve,&mdash;she won the confidence and affection of those who attracted her, by unbounded sympathy and trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6036"/>She probably knew the cherished secrets of more hearts than any <num value="1">one</num> else, because she freely imparted her own. With a full share both of intellectual and of family pride, she preeminently recognized and responded to the essential brotherhood of all human kind, and needed but to know that a fellow-being required her counsel or assistance, to render her, not merely willing, but eager to impart it. Loving ease, luxury, and the world's good opinion, she stood ready to renounce them all, at the call of pity or of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6037"/>I think no <num value="1">one</num>, not radically averse to the whole system of domestic servitude, would have treated servants, of whatever class, with such uniform and thoughtful consideration,&mdash;a regard which wholly merged their factitious condition in their antecedent and permanent humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6038"/>I think few servants ever lived weeks with her, who were not dignified and lastingly benefited by her influence and her counsels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6039"/>They might be at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> repelled, by what seemed her too stately manner and exacting disposition, but they soon learned to esteem and love her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6040"/>I have known few women, and scarcely another maiden, who had the heart and the courage to speak with such frank compassion, in mixed circles, of the most degraded and outcast portion of the sex. The contemplation of their treatment, especially by the guilty authors of their ruin, moved her to a calm and mournful indignation, which she did not attempt to suppress nor control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6041"/>Others were willing to pity and deplore; <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was more inclined to vindicate and to redeem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6042"/><pb id="p.2160" n="2160"/> She did not hesitate to avow that on meeting some of these abused, unhappy sisters, she had been surprised to find them scarcely fallen morally below the ordinary standard of Womanhood,&mdash;realizing and loathing their debasement; anxious to escape it; and only repelled by the sad consciousness that for them sympathy and society remained only so long as they should persist in the ways of pollution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6043"/>Those who have read her <quote>Woman,</quote> may remember some daring comparisons therein suggested between these Pariahs of society and large classes of their respectable sisters; and that was no fitful expression,&mdash;no sudden outbreak,&mdash;but impelled by her most deliberate convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6044"/>I think, if she had been born to large fortune, a house of refuge for all female outcasts desiring to return to the ways of Virtue, would have been <num value="1">one</num> of her most cherished and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> realized conceptions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6045"/>Her love of children was <num value="1">one</num> of her most prominent characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6046"/>The pleasure she enjoyed in their society was fully counterpoised by that she imparted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6047"/>To them she was never lofty, nor reserved, nor mystical; for no <num value="1">one</num> had ever a more perfect faculty for entering into their sports, their feelings, their enjoyments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6048"/>She could narrate almost any story in language level to their capacities, and in a manner calculated to bring out their hearty and often boisterously expressed delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6049"/>She possessed marvellous powers of observation and imitation or mimicry; and, had she been attracted to the stage, would have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> actress America has produced, whether in tragedy or comedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6050"/>Her faculty of mimicking was not needed to commend her to the hearts of children, but it had its effect in increasing the fascinations of her genial nature and heartfelt joy in <pb id="p.2161" n="2161"/> their society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6051"/>To amuse and instruct them was an achievement for which she would readily forego any personal object; and her intuitive perception of the toys, games, stories, rhymes, &amp;c., best adapted to arrest and enchain their attention, was unsurpassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6052"/>Between her and my only child, then living, who was <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> old when she came to us, and something over <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> when she sailed for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, tendrils of affection gradually intertwined themselves, which I trust Death has not severed, but rather multiplied and strengthened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6053"/>She became his teacher, playmate, and monitor; and he requited her with a prodigality of love and admiration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6054"/>I shall not soon forget their meeting in my office, after some weeks' separation, just before she left us forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6055"/>His mother had brought him in from the country and left him asleep on my sofa, while she was absent making purchases, and he had rolled off and hurt himself in the fall, waking with the shock in a phrensy of anger, just before <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, hearing of his arrival, rushed into the office to find him. I was vainly attempting to soothe him as she entered; but he was running from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other of the office, crying passionately, and refusing to be pacified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6056"/>She hastened to him, in perfect confidence that her endearments would calm the current of his feelings,&mdash;that the sound of her well-remembered voice would banish all thought of his pain,&mdash;and that another moment would see him restored to gentleness; but, half-wakened, he did not heed her, and probably did not even realize who it was that caught him repeatedly in her arms and tenderly insisted that he should restrain himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6057"/>At last she desisted in despair; and, with the bitter tears streaming down her <pb id="p.2162" n="2162"/> face, observed:&mdash; <quote>Pickie, many friends have treated me unkindly, but no <num value="1">one</num> had ever the power to cut me to the heart, as you have!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6058"/>Being thus let alone, he soon came to himself, and their mutual delight in the meeting was rather heightened by the momentary estrangement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6059"/>They had <num value="1">one</num> more meeting; their last on earth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6060"/><quote>Aunty <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName></quote> was to embark for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> on a certain day, and <quote> Pickie</quote> was brought into the city to bid her farewell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6061"/>They met this time also at my office, and together we thence repaired to the ferry-boat, on which she was returning to her residence in <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName> to complete her preparations for the voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6062"/>There they took a tender and affecting leave of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6063"/>But soon his mother called at the office, on her way to the departing ship, and we were easily persuaded to accompany her thither, and say farewell once more, to the manifest satisfaction of both <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> and the youngest of her devoted friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6064"/>Thus they parted, never to meet again in time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6065"/>She sent him messages and presents repeatedly from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; and he, when somewhat older, dictated a letter in return, which was joyfully received and acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6066"/>When the mother of our great-souled friend spent some days with us nearly <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> afterward, <quote>Pickie</quote> talked to her often and lovingly of <quote>Aunty <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>,</quote> proposing that they <num value="2">two</num> should <quote>take a boat and go over and see her,</quote> &mdash;for, to his infantile conception, the low coast of <placeName key="tgn,7015824" n="1.000 2" reg="long island city, queens, new york">Long Island</placeName>, visible just across the <placeName reg="East River, Cortland, New York" key="tgn,2068999">East River</placeName>, was that <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to which she had sailed, and where she was unaccountably detained so long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6069"/>Another year had just ended, when a calamity, equally sudden, bereft a wide circle of her likewise, with her husband and infant son. Little did I fear, when I bade her a confident Good-by, on the deck of her outward-bound ship, that the sea would close over her earthly remains, ere we should meet again; far less that the light of my eyes and the cynosure of my hopes, who then bade her a tenderer and sadder farewell, would precede her on the dim pathway to that <quote><placeName reg="Father's house">Father's house</placeName>,</quote> whence is no returning!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6095"/>Indeed, I must frankly confess, that we did not meet in pleasant relations, except now and then, when the lifting of a veil, as it were, revealed for a moment the true life of each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6225"/>I said I thought it was, as the ground was full of springs that were bridged over in the path way. He accordingly went to look for it, and I stood still, because I was so tired I did not like to waste any labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6226"/>Soon he called to me that he had found it, and I followed in the direction where he seemed to be. But I mistook, overshot it, and saw him no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6228"/>It seems, he on his side shouted also, but the brow of some hill was between us, and we neither saw nor heard <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6229"/>I then thought I would make the best of my way down, and I should find him when I arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6230"/>But, in doing so, I found the justice of my apprehension about the springs, so soon as I got to the foot of the hills; for I would sink up to my knees in bog, and must go up the hills again, seeking better crossing places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6231"/>Thus I lost much time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6232"/>Nevertheless, in the twilight, I saw, at last, the lake, and the inn of Rowardennan on its shore.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6233"/>Between me and it, lay, direct, a high heathery hill, which I afterwards found is called <q direct="unspecified">The Tongue,</q> because hemmed in on <num value="3">three</num> sides by a water-course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6235"/>I then attempted to descend in the water-course, but, finding that impracticable, climbed on the hill again, and let myself down by the heather, for it was very steep, and full of deep holes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6236"/>With great fatigue, I got to the bottom, but when I was about to cross the water-course there, I felt afraid, it looked so deep in the dim twilight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6237"/>I got down as far <pb id="p.2180" n="2180"/> as I could by the root of a tree, and threw down a stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6238"/>It sounded very hollow, and I was afraid to jump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6239"/>The shepherds told me afterwards, if I had, I should probably have killed myself, it was so deep, and the bed of the torrent full of sharp stones.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6240"/>I then tried to ascend the hill again, for there was no other way to get off it; but soon sank down utterly exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6241"/>When able to get up again, and look about me, it was completely dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6242"/>I saw, far below me, a light, that looked about as big as a pin's head, that I knew to be from the inn at Rowardennan, but heard no sound except the rush of the waterfall, and the sighing of the night wind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6243"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few minutes after I perceived I had come to my night's lodging, such as it was, the circumstance looked appalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6244"/>I was very lightly clad, my feet and dress were very wet, I had only a little shawl to throw round me, and the cold autumn wind had already come, and the night mist was to fall on me, all fevered and exhausted as I was. I thought I should not live through the night, or, if I did, I must be an invalid henceforward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6245"/>I could not even keep myself warm by walking, for, now it was dark, it would be too dangerous to stir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6246"/>My only chance, however, lay in motion, and my only help in myself; and so convinced was I of this, that I did keep in motion the whole of that long night, imprisoned as I was on such a little perch of that great mountain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6247"/>For about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, I saw the stars, and very cheery and companionable they looked; but then the mist fell, and I saw nothing more, except such apparitions as visited <persName><foreName>Ossian</foreName></persName>, on the hill-side, when he went out by night, and struck the bosky shield, and called to him the spirits of the heroes, and the white-armed maids, with <pb id="p.2181" n="2181"/> their blue eyes of grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6248"/>To me, too, came those visionary shapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6249"/>Floating slowly and gracefully, their white robes would unfurl from the great body of mist in which they had been engaged, and come upon me with a kiss pervasively cold as that of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6250"/>Then the moon rose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6251"/>I could not see her, but her silver light filled the mist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6252"/>Now I knew it was <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, and that, having weathered out so much of the night, I might the rest; and the hours hardly seemed long to me more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6253"/>It may give an idea of the extent of the mountain, that, though I called, every now and then, with all my force, in case by chance some aid might be near, and though no less than <num value="20">twenty</num> men, with their dogs, were looking for me, I never heard a sound, except the rush of the waterfall and the sighing of the night wind, and once or twice the startling of the grouse in the heather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6254"/>It was sublime indeed,&mdash;a never-to-be-forgotten presentation of stern, serene realities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6255"/>At last came the signs of day,&mdash;the gradual clearing and breaking up; some faint sounds from I know not what; the little flies, too, arose from their bed amid the purple heather, and bit me. Truly they were very welcome to do so. But what was my disappointment to find the mist so thick, that I could see neither lake nor inn, nor anything to guide me. I had to go by guess, and, as it happened, my <name>Yankee</name> method served me well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6256"/>I ascended the hill, crossed the torrent, in the waterfall, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drinking some of the water, which was as good at that time as ambrosia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6257"/>I crossed in that place, because the waterfall made steps, as it were, to the next hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6258"/>To be sure, they were covered with water, but I was already entirely wet with the mist, so that it did not matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6259"/>I kept on scrambling, as it happened, in the right direction, <pb id="p.2182" n="2182"/> till, about <num value="7">seven</num>, some of the shepherds found me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6260"/>Entirely contrary to my forebodings, I only suffered for this a few days, and was able to take a parting look at my prison, as I went down the lake, with feelings of complacency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6261"/>It was a majestic-looking hill, that Tongue, with the deep ravines on either side, and the richest robe of heather I have anywhere seen.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6279"/>But more than I expected were in town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6280"/>These introduced others, and in <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> I was engaged in such a crowd of acquaintance, that I had hardly time to dress, and none to sleep, during all the weeks I was in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6281"/>I enjoyed the time extremely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6282"/>I find myself much in my element in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6283"/>It does not, indeed, come up to my ideal, but so many of the encumbrances are cleared away that used to weary me in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, that I can enjoy a freer play of faculty, and feel, if not like a bird in the air, at least as easy as a fish in water.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6285"/>He is still quite a young man, but with a high ambition, and, I should think, commensurate powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6286"/>But all is yet in the bud with him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6287"/>Of the people I saw in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, you will wish me to speak <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the <name>Carlyles</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6288"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> C. came to see me at once, and appointed an evening to be passed at their house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6289"/>That <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, I was delighted with him. He <pb id="p.2185" n="2185"/> was in a very sweet humor,&mdash;full of wit and patios, without being overbearing or oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6290"/>I was quite carried away with the rich flow of his discourse; and the hearty, noble earnestness of his personal being brought back the charm which once was upon his writing, before I wearied of it. I admired his Scotch, his way of singing his great full sentences, so that each <num value="1">one</num> was like the stanza of a narrative ballad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6291"/>He let me talk, now and then, enough to free my lungs and change my position, so that I did not get tired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6292"/>That evening, he talked of the present state of things in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, giving light, witty sketches of the men of the day, fanatics and others, and some sweet, homely stories he told of things he had known of the <name>Scotch</name> peasantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6293"/>Of you he spoke with hearty kindness; and he told, with beautiful feeling, a story of some poor farmer, or artisan, in the country, who on Sunday lays aside the cark and care of that dirty <name>English</name> world, and sits reading the <name>Essays</name>, and looking upon the sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6294"/>I left him that night, intending to go out very often to their house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6295"/>I assure you there never was anything so witty as <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02185.01210" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s description of&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;It was enough to kill <num value="1">one</num> with laughing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6296"/>I, on my side, contributed a story to his fund of anecdote on this subject, and it was fully appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6297"/><persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02185.01211" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> is worth a <num value="1000">thousand</num> of you for that;&mdash;he is not ashamed to laugh, when he is amused, but goes on in a cordial human fashion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6298"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> C. had a dinner-party, at which was a witty, <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02185.01212" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, flippant sort of man, author of a History of Philosophy, and now writing a Life of <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02185.01213" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, a task for which he must be as unfit as irreligion and sparkling shallowness can make him. But he told stories admirably, and was allowed sometimes to interrupt <pb id="p.2186" n="2186"/> Carlyle a little, of which <num value="1">one</num> was glad, for, that night, he was in his more acrid mood; and, though much more brilliant than on the former evening, grew wearisome to me, who disclaimed and rejected almost every.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6299"/>thing he said.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6300"/>For a couple of hours, he was talking about poetry, and the whole harangue was <num value="1">one</num> eloquent proclamation of the defects in his own mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6301"/><persName n="Tennyson,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02186.01214" reg="mostcommon:Tennyson,nomatch:0"><surname>Tennyson</surname></persName> wrote in verse because the schoolmasters had taught him that it was great to do so, and had thus, unfortunately, been turned from the true path for a man. <persName n="Burns,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02186.01215" reg="mostcommon:Burns,nomatch:0"><surname>Burns</surname></persName> had, in like manner, been turned from his vocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6302"/><persName n="Shakspeare,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02186.01216" reg="mostcommon:Shakspeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakspeare</surname></persName> had not had the good sense to see that it would have been better to write straight on in prose;&ndash;and such nonsense, which, though amusing enough at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, he ran to death after a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6303"/>The most amusing part is always when he comes back to some refrain, as in the <rs>French Revolution</rs> of the <hi rend="italics">sea-green</hi>. In this instance, it was <persName n="Petrarch,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02186.01217" reg="mostcommon:Petrarch,nomatch:0"><surname>Petrarch</surname></persName> and <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName></hi>, the last word pronounced with his ineffable sarcasm of drawl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6304"/>Although he said this over <num value="50">fifty</num> times, I could not ever help laughing when <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName></hi> would come,&mdash;Carlyle running his chin out, when he spoke it, and his eyes glancing till they looked like the eyes and beak of a bird of prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6305"/>Poor <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6306"/>Lucky for her that her poet had already got her safely canonized beyond the reach of this Teufelsdrockh vulture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6307"/>The worst of hearing <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02186.01218" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> is that you cannot interrupt him. I understand the habit and power of haranguing have increased very much upon him, so that you are a perfect prisoner when he has once got hold of you. To interrupt him is a physical impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6308"/>If you get a chance to remonstrate for a moment, he raises his voice and bears you down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6309"/>True, he does <pb id="p.2187" n="2187"/> you no injustice, and, with his admirable penetration, sees the disclaimer in your mind, so that you are not morally delinquent; but it is not pleasant to be unable to utter it. The latter part of the evening, however, he paid us for this, by a series of sketches, in his finest style of railing and raillery, of modern <name>French</name> literature, not <num value="1">one</num> of them, perhaps, perfectly just, but all drawn with the finest, boldest strokes, and, from his point of view, masterly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6310"/>All were depreciating, except that of Beranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6311"/>Of him he spoke with perfect justice, because with hearty sympathy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6312"/>I had, afterward, some talk with <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> C., whom hitherto I had only <hi rend="italics">seen</hi>, for who can speak while her husband is there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6313"/>I like her very much;&mdash;she is full of grace, sweetness, and talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6314"/>Her eyes are sad and charming. * * *</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6315"/>After this, they went to stay at <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ashburton</foreName></persName>'s, and I only saw them once more, when they came to pass an evening with us. Unluckily, <persName n="Mazzini,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02187.01219" reg="mostcommon:Mazzini,Joseph,,,:1"><surname>Mazzini</surname></persName> was with&mdash;us, whose society, when he was there alone, I enjoyed more than any. He is a beauteous and pure music; also, he is a dear friend of <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> C.; but his being there gave the conversation a turn to <q direct="unspecified">progress</q> and ideal subjects, and C. was fluent in invectives on all our <q direct="unspecified">rose-water imbecilities.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6316"/>We all felt distant from him, and <persName n="Mazzini,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02187.01220" reg="mostcommon:Mazzini,Joseph,,,:1"><surname>Mazzini</surname></persName>, after some vain efforts to remonstrate, became very sad. <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> C. said to me, <q direct="unspecified">These are but opinions to <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02187.01221" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>; but to <persName n="Mazzini,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02187.01222" reg="mostcommon:Mazzini,Joseph,,,:1"><surname>Mazzini</surname></persName>, who has given his all, and helped bring his friends to the scaffold, in pursuit of such subjects, it is a matter of life and death.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6317"/></p> 
<p>All <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02187.01223" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s talk, that evening, was a defence of mere force,&mdash;success the test of right;&mdash;if people would not behave well, put collars round their necks;&mdash;find a <pb id="p.2188" n="2188"/> hero, and let them be his slaves, &amp;c. It was very Titanic, and anti-celestial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6318"/>I wish the last evening had been more melodious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6319"/>However, I bid <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02188.01224" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> farewell with feelings of the warmest friendship and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6320"/>We cannot feel otherwise to a great and noble nature, whether it harmonize with our own or not. I never appreciated the work he has done for his age till I saw <persName n="England,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02188.01225" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6321"/>I could not. You must stand in the shadow of that mountain of shams, to know how hard it is to cast light across it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6322"/>Honor to <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02188.01226" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6323"/><hi rend="italics">Hoch</hi>! Although in the wine with which we drink this health, I, for <num value="1">one</num>, must mingle the despised <q direct="unspecified">rose-water.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6324"/></p> 
<p>And now, having to your eye shown the defects of my own mind, in the sketch of another, I will pass on more lowly,&mdash;more willing to be imperfect,&mdash;since Fate permits such noble creatures, after all, to be only this or that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6325"/>It is much if <num value="1">one</num> is not only a crow or magpie;&mdash;Carlyle is only a lion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6326"/>Some time we may, all in full, be intelligent and humanly fair.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6328"/>He does not converse;&mdash;only harangues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6329"/>It is the usual misfortune of such marked men,&mdash;happily not <num value="1">one</num> invariable or inevitable,&mdash;that they cannot allow other minds room to breathe, and show themselves in their atmosphere, and thus miss the refreshment and instruction which the greatest never cease to need from the experience of the humblest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6330"/><persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02188.01229" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> allows no <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.2189" n="2189"/> a chance, but bears down all opposition, not only by his wit and onset of words, resistless in their sharpness as so many bayonets, but by actual physical superiority,&mdash; raising his voice, and rushing on his opponent with a torrent of sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6331"/>This is not in the least from unwillingness to allow freedom to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6332"/>On the contrary, no man would more enjoy a manly resistance to his thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6333"/>But it is the habit of a mind accustomed to follow out its own impulse, as the hawk its prey, and which knows not how to stop in the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6334"/><persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02189.01230" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>, indeed, is arrogant and overbearing; but in his arrogance there is no littleness,&mdash;no self-love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6335"/>It is the heroic arrogance of some old Scandinavian conqueror;&mdash;it is his nature, and the untamable energy that has given him power to crush the dragons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6336"/>You do not love him, perhaps, nor revere; and perhaps, also, he would only laugh at you if you did; but you like him heartily, and like to see him the powerful smith, the <name>Siegfried</name>, melting all the old iron in his furnace till it glows to a sunset red, and burns you, if you senselessly go too near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6337"/>He seems, to me, quite isolated,&mdash;lonely as the desert,&mdash; yet never was a man more fitted to prize a man, could he find <num value="1">one</num> to match his mood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6338"/>He finds them, but only in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6339"/>He sings, rather than talks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6340"/>He pours upon you a kind of satirical, heroical, critical poem, with regular cadences, and generally, near the beginning hits upon some singular epithet, which serves as a <hi rend="italics">refrain</hi> when his song is full, or with which, as with a knitting needle, lie catches up the stitches, if he has chanced, now and then, to let fall a row. For the higher kinds of poetry he has no sense, and his talk on that subject is delightfully and gorgeously absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6341"/>He sometimes stops a minute to laugh at it himself, then begins anew with <pb id="p.2190" n="2190"/> fresh vigor; for all the spirits he is driving before him seem to him as Fata Morgana, ugly masks, in fact, if he can but make them turn about; but he laughs that they seem to others such dainty Ariels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6342"/>His talk, like his books, is full of pictures; his critical strokes masterly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6343"/>Allow for his point of view, and his survey is admirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6344"/>He is a large subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6345"/>I cannot speak more or wiselier of him now, nor needs it;&mdash;his works are true, to blame and praise him,&mdash;the <name>Siegfried</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,&mdash;great and powerful, if not quite invulnerable, and of a might rather to destroy evil, than legislate for good.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6347"/>He is very simple, natural, and good; excellent to see, though <num value="1">one</num> cannot go far with him; and he would be worth more in writing, if he could get time to write, than in personal intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6348"/>He may yet find time;&mdash;he is scarcely more than <num value="30">thirty</num>. <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> W. wished to introduce me to <persName n="Clissold,Mister,,,," id="n0234.0011.02190.01232" reg="mostcommon:Clissold,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clissold</surname></persName>, but I had not time; shall find it, if in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6354"/>Marston I saw several times, and found him full of talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6355"/>That is all I want to say at present;&mdash;he is a delicate nature, that can only be known in its own way and time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6356"/>I went to see his <q direct="unspecified">Patrician's Daughter.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6408"/>I began to think I was doomed to a rebuff, among the crowd who deserve it. However, to make assurance sure, I said, <q direct="unspecified">Ask if she has not received a letter from me.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6409"/>As I spoke, <rs type="role2">Madame</rs> S. opened the door, and stood looking at me an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6410"/>Our eyes met. I never shall forget her look at that moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6411"/>The doorway made a frame for her figure; she is large, but well-formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6412"/>She was dressed in a robe of dark violet silk, with a black mantle on her shoulders, her beautiful hair dressed with the greatest taste, her whole appearance and attitude, in its simple and ladylike dignity, presenting an almost ludicrous contrast to the vulgar caricature idea of George Sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6413"/>Her face is a very little like the portraits, but much finer; the upper part of the forehead and eyes are beautiful, the lower, strong and masculine, expressive of a hardy temperament and strong passions, but not in the least coarse; the complexion olive, and the air of the whole head Spanish, (as, indeed, she was born at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>, and is only on <num value="1">one</num> side of <name>French</name> blood.) All these details I saw at a glance; but what fixed my attention was the expression of <hi rend="italics">goodness</hi>, nobleness, and power, that pervaded the whole,&mdash; the truly human heart and nature that shone in the eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6414"/>As our eyes met, she said, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">C'est vous</hi>,</q> and held out her hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6415"/>I took it, and went into her little study; we sat down a moment, then I said, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Il me fait de bien de vous voir</hi>,</q> and I am sure I said it with my whole heart, for it made me very happy to see such a woman, so <pb id="p.2196" n="2196"/> large and so developed a character, and everything that <hi rend="italics">is</hi> good in it so <hi rend="italics">really</hi> good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6416"/>I loved, shall always love her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6417"/>She looked away, and said, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6418"/>vous m'avez &eacute;crit une lettre charmante</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6419"/>This was all the preliminary of our talk, which then went on as if we had always known <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6420"/>She told me, before I went away, that she was going that very day to write to me; that when the servant announced me she did not recognize the name, but after a minute it struck her that it might be <hi rend="italics"><address><street n="La place">La</street></address> dame Americaine</hi>, as the foreigners very commonly call me, for they find my name hard to remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6421"/>She was very much pressed for time, as she was then preparing copy for the printer, and, having just returned, there were many applications to see her, but she wanted me to stay then, saying, <q direct="unspecified">It is better to throw things aside, and seize the present moment.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6422"/>I staid a good part of the day, and was very glad afterwards, for I did not see her again uninterrupted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6423"/>Another day I was there, and saw her in her circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6424"/>Her daughter and another lady were present, and a number of gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6425"/>Her position there was of an intellectual woman and good friend,&mdash;the same as my own in the circle of my acquaintance as distinguished from my intimates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6426"/>Her daughter is just about to be married.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6427"/>It is said, there is no congeniality between her and her mother; but for her son she seems to have much love, and he loves and admires her extremely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6428"/>I understand he has a good and free character, without conspicuous talent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6429"/>Her way of talking is just like her writing,&mdash;lively, picturesque, with an undertone of deep feeling, and the same skill in striking the nail on the head every now and then with a blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6430"/><pb id="p.2197" n="2197"/></p> 
<p>We did not talk at all of personal or private matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6431"/>I saw, as <num value="1">one</num> sees in her writings, the want of an independent, interior life, but I did not feel it as a fault, there is so much in her of her kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6432"/>I heartily enjoyed the sense of so rich, so prolific, so ardent a genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6433"/>I liked the woman in her, too, very much; I never liked a woman better.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6434"/>For the rest I do not care to write about it much, for I cannot, in the room and time I have to spend, express my thoughts as I would; but as near as I can express the sum total, it is this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6435"/>S&mdash;&mdash;and others who admire her, are anxious to make a fancy picture of her, and represent her as a Helena (in the <num value="7">Seven</num> Chords of the <name>Lyre</name>); all whose mistakes are the fault of the present state of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6436"/>But to me the truth seems to be this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6437"/>She has that purity in her soul, for she knows well how to love and prize its beauty; but she herself is quite another sort of person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6438"/>She needs no defence, but only to be understood, for she has bravely acted out her nature, and always with good intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6439"/>She might have loved <num value="1">one</num> man permanently, if she could have found <num value="1">one</num> contemporary with her who could interest and command her throughout her range; but there was hardly a possibility of that, for such a person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6440"/>Thus she has naturally changed the objects of her affection, and several times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6441"/>Also, there may have been something of the <name>Bacchante</name> in her life, and of the love of night and storm, and the free raptures amid which roamed on the mountain-tops the followers of <persName n="Cybele,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02197.01260" reg="mostcommon:Cybele,nomatch:0"><surname>Cybele</surname></persName>, the great goddess, the great mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6442"/>But she was never coarse, never gross, and I am sure her generous heart has not failed to draw some rich drops from every kind of wine-press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6443"/>When she has done with an intimacy, she likes to break it off <pb id="p.2198" n="2198"/> suddenly, and this has happened often, both with men and women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6444"/>Many calumnies upon her are traceable to this cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6445"/>I forgot to mention, that, while talking, she <hi rend="italics">does</hi> smoke all the time her little cigarette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6446"/>This is now a common practice among ladies abroad, but I believe originated with her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6447"/>For the rest, she holds her place in the literary and social world of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> like a man, and seems full of energy and courage in it. I suppose she has suffered much, but she has also enjoyed and done much, and her expression is <num value="1">one</num> of calmness and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6448"/>I was sorry to see her <hi rend="italics">exploitant</hi> her talent so carelessly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6449"/>She does too much, and this cannot last forever; but <q direct="unspecified">Teverino</q> and the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,1099535;tgn,1008041" n="0.005 000000.1030	placename;tgn,1099535;Mare,Western,Papua New Guinea,Oceania,Western,Papua New Guinea,Oceania;0.005 000000.1030	placename;tgn,1008041;Mare,Iles Loyaute,Nouvelle-Caledonie,Oceania,Iles Loyaute,Nouvelle-Caledonie,Oceania" reg="Mare,Western,Papua New Guinea,Oceania,Western,Papua New Guinea,Oceania;Mare,Iles Loyaute,Nouvelle-Caledonie,Oceania,Iles Loyaute,Nouvelle-Caledonie,Oceania">Mare</placeName> au Diable,</q> which she has lately published, are as original, as masterly in truth, and as free in invention, as anything she has done.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6467"/>Nature has not gifted her with those softer and more flowery attributes, that lend to pathos its atmost tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6474"/>The <name>French</name> language from her lips is a divine dialect; it is stripped of its national and personal peculiarities, and becomes what any language must, moulded by such a genius, the pure music of the heart and soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6479"/>Still it will be a <hi rend="italics">grandiose</hi>, gypsy, or rather Sibylline ugliness, well adapted to the expression of some tragic parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7397"/>He is not in any respect such a person as people in general would expect to find with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7398"/>On the other hand, he has excellent practical sense; has been a judicious observer of all that passed before his eyes; has a nice sense of duty, which, in its unfailing, minute activity, may put most enthusiasts to shame; a very sweet temper, and great native refinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7399"/>His love for me has been unswerving and most tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7400"/>I have never suffered a pain that he could relieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7401"/>His devotion, when I am ill, is to be compared only with yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7403"/>I do not know whether he will always love me so well, for I am the elder, and the difference will become, n a few years, more perceptible than now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7404"/>However my other friends may feel, I am sure that you will love him very much, and that he will love you no less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7427"/>He is not precisely reserved, but it is not natural to him to talk about the objects of strong affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7428"/>I am sure he would not try to describe me to his sister, but would rather she would take her own impression of me; and, as much as possible, I wish to do the same by him. I presume that, to many of my friends, he will be nothing, and they will not understand that I should have life in common with <pb id="p.2277" n="2277"/> him. But I do not think he will care;&mdash; he has not the slightest tinge of self-love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7429"/>He has, throughout our intercourse, been used to my having many such ties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7430"/>He has no wish to be anything to persons with whom he does not feel spontaneously bound, and when I am occupied, is happy in himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7431"/>But some of my friends and my family, who will see him in the details of practical life, cannot fail to prize the purity and simple strength of his character; and, should he continue to love me as he has done, his companionship will be an inestimable blessing to me. I say <hi rend="italics">if</hi>, because all human affections are frail, and I have experienced too great revulsions in my own, not to know it. Yet I feel great confidence in the permanence of his love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7432"/>It has been unblemished so far, under many trials; especially as I have been more desponding and unreasonable, in many ways, than I ever was before, and more so, I hope, than I ever shall be again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7433"/>But at all such times, he never had a thought except to sustain and cheer me. He is capable of the sacred love,&mdash; the love passing that of woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7434"/>He showed it to his father, to <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName>, to me. Now he loves his child in the same way. I think he will be an excellent father, though he could not speculate about it, nor, indeed, about anything.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7435"/>Our meeting was singular,&mdash;fateful, I may say. Very soon he offered me his hand through life, but I never dreamed I should take it. I loved him, and felt very unhappy to leave him; but the connection seemed so every way unfit, I did not hesitate a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7436"/>He, however, thought I should return to him, as I did. I acted upon a strong impulse, and could not analyze at all what passed in my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7437"/>I neither rejoice not grieve;&mdash; for bad or for good, I acted out my character, <pb id="p.2278" n="2278"/> Had I never connected myself with any <num value="1">one</num>, my path was clear; now it is all hid; but, in that case, my development must have been partial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7438"/>As to marriage, I think the intercourse of heart and mind may be fully enjoyed without entering into this partnership of daily life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7439"/>Still, I do not find it burdensome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7440"/>The friction that I have seen mar so much the domestic happiness of others does not occur with us, or, at least, has not occurred.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7442"/>Still, the great novelty, the immense gain, to me, is my relation with my child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7443"/>I thought the mother's heart lived in me before, but it did not;&mdash; I knew nothing about it. Yet, before his birth, I dreaded it. I thought I should not survive; but if I did, and my child did, was I not cruel to bring another into this terrible world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7444"/>I could not, at that time, get any other view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7445"/>When he was born, that deep melancholy changed at once into rapture; but it did not last long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7446"/>Then came the prudential motherhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7447"/>I grew a coward, a caretaker, not only for the morrow, but, impiously faithless, for <num value="20">twenty</num> or <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7448"/>It seemed very wicked to have brought the little tender thing into the midst of cares and perplexities we had not feared in the least for ourselves.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7451"/>During the siege of <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName>, I could not see my little boy. What I endured at that time, in various ways <pb id="p.2279" n="2279"/> not many would survive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7452"/>In the burning sun, I went every day, to wait, in the crowd, for letters about him. Often they did not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7453"/>I saw blood that had streamed on the wall where <persName n="Ossoli,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02279.01435" reg="nearbymention:Ossoli,Angelo,Eugene,,"><surname>Ossoli</surname></persName> was.

I sought solace in tending the suffering men; but when I beheld the beautiful fair young men bleeding to death, or mutilated for life, I felt the woe of all the mothers who had nursed each to that full flower, to see them thus cut down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7454"/>I felt the <hi rend="italics">consolation</hi>, too,&mdash;for those youths died worthily.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7532"/><num value="1">One</num> incident I may as well narrate in this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7533"/>It happened, that, some time before the coming of the <rs>French</rs>, while <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was travelling quite by herself, on her return from a visit to her child, who was out at nurse in the country, she rested for an hour or <num value="2">two</num> at a little wayside <hi rend="italics">osteria</hi>. While there, she was startled by the <hi rend="italics">padrone</hi>, who, with great alarm, rushed into the room, and said, <quote>We are quite lost!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7534"/>here is the <rs>Legion Garibaldi</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7535"/>These men always pillage,&mdash;and, if we do not give all up to them without pay, they will kill us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7536"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> looked out upon the road, and saw that it was <pb id="p.2287" n="2287"/> quite true, that the legion was coming thither with all speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7537"/>For a moment, she said, she felt uncomfortably; for such was the exaggerated account of the conduct of the men, that she thought it quite possible that they would take her horses, and so leave her without the means of proceeding on her journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7538"/>On they came, and she determined to offer them a lunch at her own expense; having faith that gentleness and courtesy was the best protection from injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7539"/>Accordingly, as soon as they arrived, and rushed boisterously into the <hi rend="italics">osteria</hi>, she rose, and said to the <foreign lang="it">padrone</foreign>, <quote>Give these good men wine and bread on my account; for, after their ride, they must need refreshment.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7540"/>Immediately, the noise and confusion subsided; with respectful bows to her, they seated themselves and partook of the lunch, giving her an account of their journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7541"/>When she was ready to go, and her <hi rend="italics">vettura</hi> was at the door, they waited upon her, took down the steps, and assisted her with much gentleness and respectfulness of manner, and she drove off, wondering how men with such natures could have the reputation they had. And, so far as we could gather, except in this instance, their conduct was of a most disorderly kind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7542"/>Again, on another occasion, she showed how great was her power over rude men. This was when <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend="italics">contadini</hi> at <placeName reg="Rieti, Rieti, Lazio" key="tgn,7006739">Rieti</placeName>, being in a violent quarrel, had rushed upon each other with knives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7543"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was called by the women bystanders, as the <name>Signora</name> who could most influence them to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7544"/>She went directly up to the men, whose rage was truly awful to behold, and, stepping between them, commanded them to separate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7545"/>They parted, but with such a look of deadly revenge, that <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> felt her work was but half accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7546"/>Sh <pb id="p.2288" n="2288"/> therefore sought them out separately, and talked with each, urging forgiveness; it was long, however, before she could see any change of purpose, and only by repeated conversations was it, that she brought about her desire, and saw them meet as friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7547"/>After this, her reputation as peace-maker was great, and the women in the neighborhood came to her with long tales of trouble, urging her intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7548"/>I have never known anything more extraordinary than this influence of hers over the passion and violence of the <rs>Italian</rs> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7549"/>Repeated instances come to my mind, when a look from her has had more power to quiet excitement, than any arguments and reasonings that could be brought to bear upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7550"/>Something quite superior and apart from them, the people thought her, and yet knew her as the gentle and considerate judge of their vices.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7551"/>I may also mention here, that <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s charities, according to her means, were larger than those of any other whom I ever knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7552"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time, in <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName>, while she lived upon the simplest, slenderest fare, spending only some <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12cents" type="currency">twelve cents</measure> a day for her dinner, she lent, unsolicited, her last <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> to an artist, who was then in need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7553"/>That it would ever be returned to her, she did not know; but the doubt did not restrain the hand from giving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7554"/>In this instance, it was soon repaid her; but her charities were not always towards the most deserving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7555"/>Repeated instances of the false pretences, under which demands for charity are made, were known to her after she had given to unworthy objects; but no experience of this sort ever checked her kindly impulse to give, and being once deceived taught her no lesson of distrust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7556"/>She ever listened with ready ear to all who came to her in any form of distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7557"/>Indeed, to use the language of <pb id="p.2289" n="2289"/> another friend, <quote>the prevalent impression at <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName>, among all who knew her, was, that she was a mild saint and a ministering angel.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7558"/>I have, in order to bring in these instances of her influence on those about her, deviated from my track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7559"/>We return to the life she led in <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName> during the attack of the <rs>French</rs>, and her charge of the hospitals, where she spent daily some <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure>, and, often, the entire night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7560"/>Her feeble frame was a good deal shaken by so uncommon a demand upon her strength, while, at the same time, the anxiety of her mind was intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7561"/>I well remember how exhausted and weary she was; how pale and agitated she returned to us after her day's and night's watching; how eagerly she asked for news of <persName n="Ossoli,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02289.01456" reg="nearbymention:Ossoli,Angelo,Eugene,,"><surname>Ossoli</surname></persName>, and how seldom we had any to give her, for he was unable to send her a word for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7562"/>Letters from the country there were few or none, as the communication between <placeName reg="Rieti, Rieti, Lazio" key="tgn,7006739">Rieti</placeName> and <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName> was cut off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7563"/>After <num value="1">one</num> such day, she called me to her bedside, and said that I must consent, for her sake, to keep the secret she was about to confide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7564"/>Then she told me of her marriage; where her child was, and where he was born; and gave me certain papers and parchment documents which I was to keep; and, in the event of her and her husband's death, I was to take the boy to her mother in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and confide him to her care, and that of her friend, <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7568"/>To this was affixed his seal, with those of the other witnesses, and the <name>Ossoli</name> crest was drawn in full upon the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7569"/>There was also a book, in which <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> had written the history of her acquaintance and marriage with <persName n="Ossoli,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02290.01458" reg="nearbymention:Ossoli,Angelo,Eugene,,"><surname>Ossoli</surname></persName>, and of the birth of her child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7570"/>In giving that to me, she said, <quote>If I do not survive to tell this myself to my family, this book will be to them invaluable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7571"/>Therefore keep it for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7572"/>If I live, it will be of no use, for my word will be all that they will ask.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7573"/>I took the papers, and locked them up.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7574"/>After this, she often spoke to me of the necessity there had been, and still existed, for her keeping her marriage a secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7575"/>At the time, I argued in favor of her making it public, but subsequent events have shown me the wisdom of her decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7576"/>The <hi rend="italics">explanation</hi> she gave me of the secret marriage was this:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7809"/>He is exceedingly fond of flowers;&mdash;he has been enchanted, this evening, by this splendid Gardenia, and these many crimson flowers that were given me at Villa Correggi, where a friend took us in his carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7810"/>It was a luxury, this ride, as we have entirely renounced the use of a carriage for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7811"/>How enchanted you would have been with that villa!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7812"/>It seems now as if, with the certainty of a very limited income, we could be so happy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7813"/>But I suppose, if we had it, <num value="1">one</num> of us would die, or the baby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7824"/>Angelino is now in the most perfect rosy health, &mdash;a very gay, impetuous, ardent, but sweet-tempered child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7825"/>He seems to me to have nothing in common with his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> babyhood, with its ecstatic smiles, its exquisite sensitiveness, and a distinction in the gesture and attitudes that struck everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7831"/>Sometimes he summons me to kiss his hand, and laughs very much at this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7832"/>Enchanting is that baby-laugh, all dimples and glitter,&mdash;so strangely arch and innocent!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7833"/>Then I wash and dress him. That is his great time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7834"/>He makes it last as long as he can, insisting to dress and wash me the while, kicking, throwing the water about, and full of all manner of tricks, such as, I think, girls never dream of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7887"/>None have shown littleness or displeasure, at being denied my confidence while they were giving their own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7888"/>With her, I think, this was because she was annoyed by what people said, and wished to be able to answer them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7889"/>I replied to her, that I had communicated already all I intended, and should not go into <pb id="p.2313" n="2313"/> detail;&mdash;that when unkind things were said about me, she should let them pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7890"/>Will you, dear E&mdash;&mdash;, do the same?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7891"/>I am sure your affection for me will prompt you to add, that you feel confident whatever I have done has been in a good spirit, and not contrary to <hi rend="italics">my</hi> ideas of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7892"/>For the rest, you will not admit for me,&mdash;as I do not for myself,&mdash;the rights of the social inquisition of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to know all the details of my affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7899"/>A less generous person would have been displeased, that, when we had been drawn so together,&mdash;when we had talked so freely, and you had shown towards me such sweet friendship,&mdash;I had not told you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7900"/>That moment came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7901"/>Its decisions were not such as I had hoped; but it left me, at least, without that painful burden, which I trust never to bear again Nature keeps so many secrets, that I had supposed the moral writers exaggerated the dangers and plagues of keeping them; but they cannot exaggerate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7911"/>We who, less worthy, survive, would fain make up for the loss, by our increased devotion to him, the purest, the most disinterested of patriots, the most affectionate of brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7912"/>You will not love me less that I am true to him. Then, again, how will it affect you to know that I have united my destiny with that of an obscure young man,&mdash; younger than myself; a person of no intellectual culture, and in whom, in short, you will see no reason for my choosing; yet more, that this union is of long standing; that we have with us our child, of a year old, and that it is only lately I acquainted my family with the fact?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7913"/>If you decide to meet with me as before, and wish to say something about the matter to your friends, it will be true to declare that there have been pecuniary reasons for this concealment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7914"/>But <hi rend="italics">to you</hi>, in confidence, I add, this is only half the truth; and I cannot explain, or satisfy my dear friend further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7926"/>He loves me very much; his little heart clings to mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7929"/>He has very little of what is called intellectual development, but unspoiled instincts, affections pure and constant, and a quiet sense of duty, which, to me,&mdash;who have seen much of the great faults in characters <pb id="p.2317" n="2317"/> of enthusiasm and genius,&mdash;seems of highest value.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7931"/>I did not explain myself on that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7932"/>The fact is, it looks to me silly for a radical like me to be carrying a title; and yet, while <persName n="Ossoli,,,,," id="n0234.0011.02317.01516" reg="nearbymention:Ossoli,Marchesa,,,"><surname>Ossoli</surname></persName> is in his native land, it seems disjoining myself from him, not to bear it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7933"/>Yet it has appeared to me, that for him to drop an inherited title would be, in some sort, to acquiesce in his brothers' disclaiming him, and to abandon a right he may passively wish to maintain for his child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7934"/>How does it seem to you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8187"/>Another hour or more passed by; but though persons were busy gathering into carts whatever spoil was stranded, no life-boat yet appeared; and, after much deliberation, the plan was proposed,&mdash; and, as it was then understood, agreed to,&mdash;that the passengers should attempt to land, each seated upon a plank, and grasping handles of rope, while a sailor swam behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8189"/>Once and again, during their passage, the plank was rolled wholly over, and once and again was righted, with its bearer, by the dauntless steersman; and when, at length, tossed by the surf upon the sands, the half-drowned woman still holding, as in a death-struggle, to the ropes, was about to be swept back by the undertow, he caught her in his arms, and, with the assistance of a bystander, placed her high upon the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8193"/>On a raft with them, she would have boldly encountered the surf, but alone she would not go.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8194"/>She knew, too, that if a life-boat could be sent, <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n0234.0012.02347.01611" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> who would neglect no effort to expedite its coming While she was yet declining all persuasions, word was given from the deck, that the life-boat had finally appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8195"/>For a moment, the news lighted up again the flickering fire of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8196"/>They might yet be saved,&mdash;be saved together!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8197"/>Alas! to the experienced eyes of the sailors it too soon became evident that there was no attempt to launch or man her. The last chance of aid from shore, then, was gone utterly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8198"/>They must rely on their own strength, or perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8199"/>And if ever they were to escape, the time had come; for, at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, the storm had somewhat lulled; but already the tide had turned, and it was plain that the wreck could not hold together through another flood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8200"/>In this emergency, the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, who until now had remained at his post, once more appealed to <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> to try to escape,&mdash; urging that the ship would inevitably break up soon; that it was mere suicide to remain longer; that he did not feel free to sacrifice the lives of the crew, or to throw away his own; finally, that he would himself take <persName n="Angelo,,,,," id="n0234.0012.02347.01612" reg="mostcommon:Angelo,Michel,,,:14"><surname>Angelo</surname></persName>, and that sailors should go with <persName n="Celeste,,,,," id="n0234.0012.02347.01613" reg="mostcommon:Celeste,nomatch:0"><surname>Celeste</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ossoli,,,,," id="n0234.0012.02347.01614" reg="nearbymention:Ossoli,Signore,,,"><surname>Ossoli</surname></persName>, and herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8201"/>But, as before, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> decisively declared that she would not be parted from her husband or her child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8202"/>The order was then given to <q direct="unspecified">save themselves,</q> and all but <num value="4">four</num> of the crew jumped over, several of whom, together with the commander, reached shore alive, though severely bruised and wounded by the drifting fragments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8203"/>There is a sad consolation in believing that, if <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> judged it to be impossible that the <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num></hi> should escape, she in all probability was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8204"/>It required a most rare combination of courage, promptness, <pb id="p.2348" n="2348"/> and persistency, to do what <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n0234.0012.02348.01615" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> had done for <persName n="Hasty,Mrs.,,,," id="n0234.0012.02348.01616" reg="mostcommon:Hasty,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hasty</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8206"/>It was now past <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>, and as, with the rising tide, the gale swelled once more to its former violence, the remnants of the barque fast yielded to the resistless waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8207"/>The cabin went by the board, the after-parts broke up, and the stern settled out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8208"/>Soon, too, the forecastle was filled with water, and the helpless little band were driven to the deck, where they clustered round the foremast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8209"/>Presently, even this fail support was loosened from the hull, and rose and fell with every billow.

<p>A passage from the journal of a friend of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, whom the news of the wreck drew at once to the scene, shall close this mournful story:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8221"/></p> 
<p>The hull of the <rs>Elizabeth</rs>, with the foremast still bound to it by cordage, lies so near the shore, that it seems as if a dozen oar-strokes would carry a boat alongside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8222"/>And as <num value="1">one</num> looks at it glittering in the sunshine, and rocking gently in the swell, it is hard to feel reconciled to our loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8223"/><num value="7">Seven</num> resolute men might have saved every soul on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8224"/>I know how different was the prospect on that awful morning, when the most violent gale that had visited our coast for years, drove the billows up to the very foot of the sand-hills, and when the sea in foaming torrents swept across the beach into the bay behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8225"/>Yet I cannot but reluctantly declare my judgment, that this terrible tragedy is to be attributed, so far as human agency is looked at, to our wretched system, or <hi rend="italics">no-system</hi>, of life-boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8226"/>The life-boat at <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fire Island</placeName> light-house, <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles distant</measure> only, was not brought to the beach till between <time value="12">twelve</time> and <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>, more than <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure> after the <rs>Elizabeth</rs> was stranded, and more than <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure> after the wreck could easily have been seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8227"/>When the life-boat did finally <pb id="p.2350" n="2350"/> come, the beachmen could not be persuaded to launch or man her. And even the mortar, by which a rope could and should have been thrown on board, was not once fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8228"/>A single lesson like this might certainly suffice to teach the government, insurance companies, and humane societies, the urgent need, that to every life-boat should be attached organized Crews, stimulated to do their work faithfully, by ample pay for actual service, generous salvage-fees for cargoes and persons, and a pension to surviving friends where life is lost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8229"/>No trace has yet been found of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s manuscript on <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, though the denials of the wreckers as to having seen it, are not in the least to be depended on. For, greedy after richer spoil, they might well have overlooked a mass of written paper; and, even had they kept it, they would be slow to give up what would so clearly prove their participation in the heartless robbery, that is now exciting such universal horror and indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8230"/>Possibly it was washed away before reaching the shore, as several of the trunks, it is said, were open and empty, when thrown upon the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8231"/>But it is sad to think, that very possibly the brutal hands of pirates may have tossed to the winds, or scattered on the sands, pages so rich with experience and life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8232"/>The only papers of value saved, were the love-letters of <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Ossoli,,,,," id="n0234.0012.02350.01624" reg="nearbymention:Ossoli,Signore,,,"><surname>Ossoli</surname></persName>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8235"/>When the body, stripped of every rag by the waves, was rescued from the surf, a sailor took it reverently in his arms, and, wrapping it in <pb id="p.2351" n="2351"/> his neckcloth, bore it to the nearest house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8236"/>There when washed, and dressed in a child's frock, found in <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s trunk, it was laid upon a bed; and as the rescued seamen gathered round their late playfellow and pet, there were few dry eyes in the circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8237"/>Several of them mourned for <persName n="Nino,,,,," id="n0234.0012.02351.01625" reg="mostcommon:Nino,nomatch:0"><surname>Nino</surname></persName>, as if he had been their own; and even the callous wreckers were softened, for the moment, by a sight so full of pathetic beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8238"/>The next day, borne upon their shoulders in a chest, which <num value="1">one</num> of the sailors gave for a coffin, it was buried in a hollow among the sand heaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8239"/>As I stood beside the lonely little mound, it seemed that never was seen a more affecting type of orphanage.
