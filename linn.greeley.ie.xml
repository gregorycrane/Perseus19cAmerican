<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>While we like to hear about a man's personal characteristics, in studying his biography the lessons of a life like <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0180.0001.00000.00002" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName>'s are to be found in his works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>When a <quote>gawky</quote> country lad, with a limited education and a slight acquaintance with the printer's trade, comes to the principal city of the land with a few dollars in his pocket and a single suit of clothes, and fights a fight the result of which is the founding of the most influential newspaper of his day, and the acquirement of a reputation as its editor which secures for him a nomination for the presidency of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>-in such a man's career there must be material for useful study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>And the place to study <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0180.0001.00000.00003" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> is in his newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>He made these newspapers; he gave them their character; and, in doing so, he left on them his mental photograph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/><pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/></p> 
<p>Such a study is most interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>No other editor has ever given opportunity for it. Beginning his editorial labors when both the tariff and the slavery questions were quiescent, we find in the files of the <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName>, the <name>Jeffersonian</name>, the <rs>Log Cabin</rs>, and the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York Tribune</orgName>, in order, an expression of the growing national interest in these subjects, and a discussion of them which pictures, better than any mere recital of results can do, the building up of a public sentiment that had so far-reaching results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>This is especially true of the slavery question; because <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0180.0001.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> was not an early Abolitionist-not an Abolitionist at all, in the technical sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> of those who were content to leave the <rs>South</rs> alone with its slavery as that institution was defined in the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> and restricted by the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>But he was foremost in the ranks of those who called for the observance of that compromise, who refused to concede to the <rs>South</rs> new slave territory, and who assisted in arousing the national conscience to the pitch that made an armed attempt to save the <rs>Union</rs> in the sixties a possibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Why this valiant warrior stepped aside into the ranks of the timid and the compromisers when the issue was drawn, each reader <pb id="p.vii" n="vii"/> may decide for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Why he was not content with his position and influence as an editor, and sacrificed a good deal of consistency in an effort to reach the <orgName>office of President</orgName>, may also be left to the reader's opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>His weaknesses throughout his editorial career are almost as marked as his strength, and a lack of foresight often played havoc with his judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>An editor of large experience said, on the occasion of his death: <quote>The editor of a daily paper is the object of unceasing adulation from a crowd of those who shrink from fighting the slow and doubtful battle of life in the open field, and crave the kindly shelter of editorial plaudits, <q direct="unspecified">puffs,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">mentions</q>; and he finds this adulation offered freely, and by all classes and conditions, without the least reference to his character or talents or antecedents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>What wonder if it turns the heads of unworthy men, and begets in them some of the vices of the despots-their unscrupulousness, their cruelty, and their impudence; what wonder, too, if it should have thrown off his balance a man like <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0180.0001.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, whose head was not strong, whose education was imperfect, and whose self-confidence had been fortified by a brave and successful struggle with adversity.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Of <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0180.0001.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName>'s honesty and purity of motive <pb id="p.viii" n="viii"/> there was never any question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In his days of poverty no suggestions of a need that he remain quiet about some matter in which he believed, but which was not on the popular side, had any influence with him. In the days of the slavery contest, when the business interests of his city were ready for almost any concessions to Southern customers, he defied the <quote>priests of the <name n="God" type="God">god</name> Cotton,</quote> as he called them, and rebuked them in most scathing terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>When the war was over, and the questions of adjustment and reconstruction were to be solved, he took a stand immediately and openly in favor of pardon and renewed brotherhood which cost him the favor of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of old associates, and lost him an election to the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>However much his judgment swayed, it never swayed <quote>on that side fortune leans.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The country lad who went to <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> in the summer of <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct> to seek his fortune, arrived in what would now be called a good-sized town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The <rs>Greeleys</rs>, for generations back, had not known affluence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>With the best of management it would have been difficult to obtain from such a farm more than a living for the owner's family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The <rs>Greeleys</rs> did work hard, the mother sharing with her husband such labor as raking and loading hay, besides doing housework and carding and spinning, and <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, when <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> old, gave such assistance as riding the horse to plow before going to school for the day, and killing wireworms in the corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But the father was an easy-going rather than an energetic man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He was, his son has testified, <quote>a bad manager,</quote> and always in debt, and his farm did not enable him to gain on his indebtedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In the hope of improving matters, he let his own farm to a younger brother and rented a larger <num value="1">one</num> near by. But the brother could not meet his engagements, and the family moved back in <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Sickness ensued, a speculation in lumber proved disastrous, and the end came in the summer of <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, when the home farm was seized by the sheriff at the instance of several creditors, the father took his departure to escape arrest for debt, and the farm and crops, when sold, left nothing for the wife and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><quote>When night fell,</quote> wrote the son in later years, <quote>we were as bankrupt a family as well could be.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> then had a brother, <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old, and <num value="2">two</num> sisters of <num value="6">six</num> and <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>; another sister was born in <dateStruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>There for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> the elder <rs>Greeley</rs> worked by the day at such jobs as he could secure, <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> the largest of these being the clearing of a <num value="50">fifty</num>-acre tract of land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The <num value="2">two</num> boys attended school in the winter months, but assisted their father in his laborious tasks the rest of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Cutting down trees was not the work for which boys of <num value="8">eight</num> and <num value="10">ten</num> were fitted; but they did what they could at that, and carried off the brush and drove the team.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In the early spring they chopped away, standing in slush knee-deep, and in summer they endured at night the torture of having the lances of thistles dug out of their festered feet which they could not afford to protect with shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><measure n="7dollars" type="currency">Seven dollars</measure> an acre, and half the wood, was to have been the recompense for this labor; but before the account was adjusted their employer died, and a part of even this small emolument they never received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Next, the father, again with the sons' assistance, tried farming and running a sawmill on shares at the same time, and later he united land-clearing and farming-all without financial success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This was the last of <placeName reg="Horace Greeley's farm">Horace Greeley's farm</placeName> work as a boy. He had found in it <quote>neither scope for expanding faculties, incitement to constant growth in knowledge, nor a spur to generous ambition.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But he believed in farming on business principles, and it was his experience in these early years <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> which led him, when in command of a great newspaper, to devote so much thought to a higher agriculture, and to write and speak so many words in behalf of intelligent land culture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> who visits the neighborhood where the early days of a man afterward famous have been spent will not fail to discover reminiscences of his youthful talent, and to unearth venerable predictions of his future greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This has been the case with <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0180.0002.00006.00011" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, producing a kind of biography which he himself pronounced <quote>monstrously exaggerated by gossip and tradition.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In his early years he was very delicate, and the death of <num value="2">two</num> children who had preceded him made his mother especially tender of him. She had a rare store of old-country traditions told to her by her <name>Irish</name> grandmother, and the child took an eager interest in these; and an open book on his mother's knees while she spun so attracted him that when he was <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> old he could read, and, from the manner of taking his lessons, it became indifferent to him whether the book was held sideways or even upside down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Before he was quite <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> old he was sent to the district school from the house of his grandfather, which was nearer it than his home, and this school he <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> attended most of the winter, and some of the summer, months during the next <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. He also attended the district school while they lived in <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, as circumstances permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The text-books in those days were as primitive as the teaching and the discipline, embracing <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0180.0002.00007.00012" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Daniel,,,:1"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s Spelling-Book (just introduced), The American Preceptor as a reader, and Bingam's Ladies' Accidence as a grammar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was certainly a precocious child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>All his school-fellows testified in later years to his early love of books, and that not <num value="1">one</num> of the few volumes which the neighborhood afforded escaped him, and they recalled also his interest in the weekly newspaper for which his father subscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> book that <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0180.0002.00008.00014" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> owned was The Columbian Orator, given to him by an uncle when, <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> old, he lay sick with the measles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>This covers the whole ground of breadth and restriction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>This was the putting in type of a small New Testament, with narrow columns, the text interspersed with references to notes marked by <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> and other letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>So complicated was this task, and so little could a man earn at it, paid by the ems set, that several compositors had abandoned it after a brief trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>This job the foreman offered to the country lad, confident that <num value="0.5">a half</num> day would prove his incompetence to perform it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The New Testament finished, he was out of work for a time, and was then assigned to a <quote>lean</quote> job on a commentary on the <rs>Book</rs> of Genesis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Then came further tramping, and a discharge from <num value="1">one</num> newspaper office, tradition says, because he was not <quote>decent looking,</quote> until he became so nearly discouraged that he seriously thought of trying some other form of employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> idea of seeking work at the national capital occurred to him, but while he had employment he had treated himself to a suit of clothes --a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-hand suit of black, bought of a Chatham Street dealer, in which, he says, he found <quote>no wear and little warmth</quote> --and this had so depleted his capital that he had not money enough to pay his way to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>History proved that an agricultural and grain-exporting nation had always been a poor nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/><num value="2">2</num>. <quote>There is a natural tendency in a comparatively new country to become and continue an exporter of grain and other rude staples, and an importer of manufactures.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>This was true because, in a new country, the available labor is in demand for clearing fields, opening roads, etc., while older countries have not only an adequate labor supply, but capital and machinery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/><num value="3">3</num>. <quote>It is injurious to the new country thus to continue dependent for its supplies of clothing and manufactured fabrics on the old.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>The ruling price of grain in a district which exports it will be the price at the point to <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> which it is exported, less the freight &mdash; that is, the price it brings there as obtained from the countries nearest at hand, and which can produce it most cheaply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>The <name>British</name> manufacturer would only be obliged to mark the price of his cloths <num value="0.05">5 per cent</num> below the wholesale price of the same grade in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in order to control the cloth market in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>The free-trader who sees in this only more cloth for the money for the <rs>American</rs> purchaser, overlooks the point that the <rs>American</rs> grain-producing purchaser must, under free trade, look abroad for a market for his surplus grain at the lowest world's price-<quote>in other words, while <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> is making <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure> by buying her cloth where she can buy cheapest, she is losing nearly <measure n="2000000dollars" type="currency">two million dollars</measure> on the net product of her grain.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Under this heading he explained that <quote>if manufactures were protected as a matter of special bounty or favor to the manufacturers, a single day were too long</quote> to continue the protection; protection should be afforded <quote>for the sake of all protective labor.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Why not do without protection when, under the tariff, you can manufacture cheaper than you can buy abroad?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Because, under free trade, <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> can at any time dump on us its surplus product, and so ruin our own markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>He did not admit the existence of any foreign markets for American goods, and said, <quote>If the <rs>American</rs> manufacturers can not make sales, the sheriff will and must. . . . Were it certain that the price of home products would be permanently higher than that of the foreign, I should still insist on efficient protection. .... I look not so much to the nominal price as to the facility of payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>And, where cheapness is only to be attained by a depression of the wages of labor to the neighborhood of the <rs>European</rs> standard, I prefer that it should be dispensed with.</quote>
