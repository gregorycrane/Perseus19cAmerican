<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>these reminiscences were put together, rather hastily, in my mother's <num value="81" type="ordinal">eighty-first</num> year, and were drawn almost entirely from memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>She felt at the time that she had in all probability nearly reached the limit of her earthly life: yet <measure n="11years" type="date">eleven years</measure> still remained to her, years of as full mental activity, as deep and wide and varied interests, as any that preceded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The story of those years will be told in due time, when the full tale of work and thought and love that made up her life shall be completed: meantime it is believed that a new issue of this volume may at this time be acceptable to many.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>I have been urgently asked to put together my reminiscences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>I could wish that I had begun to do so at an earlier period of my life, because at this time of writing the lines of the past are somewhat confused in my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Yet, with <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> help, I shall endeavor to do justice to the individuals whom I have known, and to the events of which I have had some personal knowledge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Let me say at the very beginning that I esteem this century, now near its close, to have eminently deserved a record among those which have been great landmarks in human history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>It has seen the culmination of prophecies, the birth of new hopes, and a marvelous multiplication both of the ideas which promote human happiness and of the resources which enable man to make himself master of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00001.00001" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Louis,,,:2"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> is said to have forbidden his subordinates to tell him that any order of his was impossible of fulfillment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><num value="1">One</num> might <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> think that the genius of this age must have uttered a like injunction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>To attain instantaneous communication with our friends across oceans and through every continent; to command locomotion whose swiftness changes the relations of space and time; to steal from Nature her deepest secrets, and to make disease itself the minister of cure; to compel the sun to keep for us the record of scenes and faces, of the great shows and pageants of time, of the perishable forms whose charm and beauty deserve to remain in the world's possession,&mdash;these are some of the achievements of our <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Even more wonderful than these may we esteem the moral progress of the race; the decline of political and religious enmities, the growth of good &mdash; will and mutual understanding between nations, the waning of popular superstition, the spread of civic ideas, the recognition of the mutual obligations of classes, the advancement of woman to dignity in the household and efficiency in the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>All this our century has seen and approved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>To the ages following it will hand on an inestimable legacy, an imperishable record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>While my heart exults at these grandeurs of which I have seen and known something, my contribution to their history can be but of fragmentary and fitful interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>On the world's great scene, each of us can only play his little part, often <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> with poor comprehension of the mighty drama which is going on around him. If any <num value="1">one</num> of us undertakes to set this down, he should do it with the utmost truth and simplicity; not as if <persName n="Seneca,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00003.00002" reg="mostcommon:Seneca,nomatch:0"><surname>Seneca</surname></persName> or <persName n="Tacitus,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00003.00003" reg="mostcommon:Tacitus,nomatch:0"><surname>Tacitus</surname></persName> or <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName> were speaking, but as he himself, plain <persName n="Hodge,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00003.00004" reg="mostcommon:Hodge,nomatch:0"><surname>Hodge</surname></persName> or Dominie or <persName n="Grundy,Mrs.,,,," id="n0298.0002.00003.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grundy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grundy</surname></persName>, is moved to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He should not borrow from others the sentiments which he ought to have entertained, but relate truthfully how matters appeared to him, as they and he went on. Thus much I can promise to do in these pages, and no more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>His father attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, being himself the son of <persName n="Ward,Governor,Samuel,,," id="n0298.0002.00003.00007" reg="default:Ward,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, <note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He frequently served as chairman of the <orgName n="Whole Committee" type="committee">Committee of the Whole</orgName>, during the secret sessions of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>His death, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, is said to have been due in large measure to the fatigue caused by his incessant labors in behalf of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Although he did not live to sign the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, he was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> men to prophesy the separation of the colonies from the mother country.</p></note> married <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> to a daughter of <persName n="Greene,Governor,,,," id="n0298.0002.00004.00009" reg="nearbymention:Greene,Nathanael,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Greene</surname></persName>, of the same state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>My mother was grandniece to <persName n="Marion,General,Francis,,," id="n0298.0002.00004.00010" reg="default:Marion,Francis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <surname>Marion</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Huguenot, Elbert, Georgia" key="tgn,2405698">Huguenot</placeName> descent, known in the <name>Revolution</name> as the <rs type="place">Swamp</rs>-fox of southern campaigns.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Let me here remark that an expert in chiromancy, after making a recent examination of my hand, exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">You inherit military blood; your hand shows it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/></p> 
<p>My own earliest recollections are of a fine house on the <placeName key="tgn,2031150;tgn,7013448;tgn,7013447" n="0.136 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2031150;Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7013448;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7013447;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America" reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America">Bowling Green</placeName>, a region of high fashion in those days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In the summer mornings my nurse sometimes walked abroad with me, and showed me the young girls of our neighborhood, engaged with their skipping ropes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Our favorite resort was the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, where the flagstaff used in the <name>Revolution</name> was still to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The fort at Castle Garden had already been converted into a pleasure resort, where fireworks and ices might be enjoyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We were <num value="6">six</num> children in all, yet <persName n="Wordsworth,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00004.00014" reg="mostcommon:Wordsworth,William,,,:1"><surname>Wordsworth</surname></persName>'s little maid would have reckoned us as <num value="7">seven</num>, as a sister of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> had died shortly before my birth, leaving me her name and the dignity of eldest daughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>She was always mentioned in the family as the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> little <persName><foreName>Julia</foreName></persName></hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>My <num value="2">two</num> eldest brothers, <persName><foreName>Samuel</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> <persName n="Ward,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00005.00015" reg="nearbymention:Ward,Samuel,,,"><surname>Ward</surname></persName>, were pupils at <orgName n="Round Hill School" type="school">Round Hill School</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A few words regarding my mother may not here be out of place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Married at <num value="16">sixteen</num>, she died at the age of <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>, so beloved and mourned by all who knew her that my early years were full of the testimony borne by surviving friends to the beauty and charm of her character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>She had been a pupil at the school of <persName n="Graham,Mrs.,Elizabeth,,," id="n0298.0002.00005.00017" reg="default:Graham,Elizabeth,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Elizabeth</foreName> <surname>Graham</surname></persName>, of saintly memory, and had inherited from her own mother a taste for intellectual pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>She was especially fond of poetry and a few lovely poems of hers remain to show that she was no stranger to its sacred domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><num value="1">One</num> of these was printed in a periodical of her own time, and is preserved in <placeName key="tgn,2023070" n="1.000 15" reg="griswoldville, jones, georgia">Griswold</placeName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Female Poets of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Another set of verses is addressed to me in the days of my babyhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>All of these bear the imprint of her deeply religious character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><persName n="Astor,Mrs.,Margaret,Armstrong,," id="n0298.0002.00005.00018" reg="default:Astor,Margaret,Armstrong,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Margaret</foreName> <foreName>Armstrong</foreName> <surname>Astor</surname></persName>, of whom more will be said in these annals, remembered my mother as prominent in the society of her youth, and spoke of her as beautiful in countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>An old lady, resident in <placeName reg="Bordentown, Burlington, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013444">Bordentown, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Her early death was a lifelong misfortune to her children, who, although tenderly bred and carefully watched, have been forced to pass their days without the dear refuge of a mother's heart, the wise guidance of a mother's inspiration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>A dear old cousin of my father's, who lived to the age of <measure n="102years" type="date">one hundred and two years</measure>, loved to talk of a visit which she had made in her youth to my grandfather <persName n="Ward,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00006.00019" reg="nearbymention:Ward,Samuel,,,"><surname>Ward</surname></persName>, then resident in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>She had not quite forgiven him for not allowing her to attend an assembly on which, being only <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> of age, she had set her heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Years after this time, when such vanities had quite gone out of her mind, she again visited relatives in the city, and came to spend the day with my mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Of this occasion she said to me: <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Julia</foreName></persName>, your mother's tact was remarkable, and she showed it on that day, for, knowing me to be a young woman of serious character, she presented me on my arrival with a plain linen collar which she had made for me. On a table beside her lay <persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00006.00020" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s <quote>Serious call to the <name>Unconverted</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Don't you see how well she had suited matters to my taste?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/></p> 
<p>This aged relative used to boast that she had never read a novel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>She desired to make <num value="1">one</num> exception in favor of the story of the <name>Schonbergr</name> <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> <persName n="Cotta,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00007.00021" reg="mostcommon:Cotta,nomatch:0"><surname>Cotta</surname></persName> family, but, hearing that it was a work of fiction, esteemed it safest to adhere to the rule which she had observed for so many years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Her son, lately deceased, once told me that when she felt called upon to chastise him for some childish offense, she would pray over him so long that he would cry out: <q direct="unspecified">Mother, it's time to begin whipping.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/></p> 
<p>Her husband was a son of <persName n="Greene,General,Nathanael,,," id="n0298.0002.00007.00022" reg="default:Greene,Nathanael,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Nathanael</foreName> <surname>Greene</surname></persName>, of Revolutionary fame.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The attention bestowed upon impressions of childhood to-day will, I hope, justify me in recording some of the earliest points in consciousness which I still recall I remember when a thimble was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> given to me, some simple bit of work being at the same time placed in my hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> said, <q direct="unspecified">Take the needle in this hand.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>I did so, and, placing the thimble on a finger of the other hand, I began to sew without its aid, to the amusement of my teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>This trifle appears to me an early indication of a want of perception as to the use of tools which has accompanied me through life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I remember also that, being told that I must ask pardon for some childish fault, I said to my mother, with perfect contentment, <q direct="unspecified">Oh yes, I pardon you,</q> and was surprised to hear that in this way I had not made the <hi rend="italics">amende honorable</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I encountered great difficulty in acquiring the <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> <hi rend="italics">th</hi> sound, when my mother tried to teach me to call her by that name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><q direct="unspecified">Muzzer, muzzer,</q> was all that I could manage to say. But the dear parent presently said, <q direct="unspecified">If you cannot do better than that, you will have to go back and call me mamma.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The shame of going back moved me to <num value="1">one</num> last effort, and, summoning my utmost strength of tongue, I succeeded in saying <q direct="unspecified">mother,</q> an achievement from which I was never obliged to recede.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>A journey up the <placeName reg="Hudson, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,1124727">Hudson River</placeName> was undertaken, when I was very young, for the bettering of my mother's health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>An older sister of hers went with us, as well as a favorite waiting-woman, and a young physician whose care had saved my father's life a year or more before my own birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>After reaching <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, we traveled in my father's carriage; the grown persons occupying the seats, and I sitting in my little chair at their feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>A book of short tales and poems was often resorted to for my amusement, and I still remember how the young doctor read to me, <q direct="unspecified">Pity the sorrows of a poor old man,</q> and how my tears came, and could not be hidden.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The sight of <placeName reg="Niagara, New York, United States" key="tgn,1002718">Niagara</placeName> caused me much surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Playing on the piazza of the hotel, <num value="1">one</num> day, with only the doctor for my companion, I ventured to ask him, <q direct="unspecified">Who made that great hole where the water comes down?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He replied, <q direct="unspecified">The great <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> Maker of all.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/><q direct="unspecified">Who is that?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I innocently inquired; and he said, <q direct="unspecified">Do you not know?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Our Father who art in heaven.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>I felt that I ought to have known, and went away somewhat abashed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Another day my mother told me that we were going to visit <persName n="Jacket,,Red,,," id="n0298.0002.00009.00023" reg="default:Jacket,Red,,,"><foreName>Red</foreName> <surname>Jacket</surname></persName>, a great <name>Indian</name> chief, and that I must be very polite to him. She gave me a twist of tobacco tied with a blue ribbon, which I was to present to him, and bade me observe the silver medal which I should see hung on his neck, and which, she said, had been given to him by <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0298.0002.00009.00024" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We drove to the <rs>Indian</rs> encampment, of which I dimly remember the extent and the wigwams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>A tall figure advanced to the carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>As its door was opened, I sprang forward, clasped my arms around the neck of the noble savage, and was astonished at his cool reception of such a greeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>I was surprised and grieved afterwards to learn that I had not done exactly the right thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The <rs>Indians</rs>, in those days and long after, occupied numerous settlements in the western part of the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>, where <num value="1">one</num> often saw the boys with their bows and arrows, and the squaws carrying their papooses on their backs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The journey here mentioned must have taken place when I was little more than <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> old. Another year and <num value="0.5">a half</num> brought me the burden of a great sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>I recall months of sweet companionship <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and dearest of friends, my mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The last summer of her life was passed at a fine country-seat in <placeName key="tgn,2068108" n="1.000 1" reg="bloomingdale, essex, new york">Bloomingdale</placeName>, which was then a picturesque country place, about <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> from New</placeName> York, but is now incorporated in the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>My father was fond of fine horses, and the pets of the stable played no unimportant part in our childish affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The family coach was an early institution with us, and in the days of which I now speak, its exterior was of a delicate yellow, known as straw-color, while the lining and cushions were of bright blue cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>This combination of color was effected to please my dear mother, who was accounted in her time a woman of excellent taste.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I remember this summer as a particularly happy period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>My younger brother and I had our lessons in a lovely green bower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Our <name>French</name> teacher came out at intervals in the <name>Bloomingdale</name> stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>My mother often took me with her for a walk in the beautiful garden, from which she plucked flowers that she arranged with great taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>There was much mysterious embroidering of small caps and gowns, the purpose of which I little guessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The autumn came, and with it our return to town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>And then, <num value="1">one</num> bitter morning, I awoke to hear the words, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Julia</foreName></persName>, your mother is dead.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Before this my father had announced to us that a <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> little sister had arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>We were taken out for a drive in fine weather, but rarely went out on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>As a consequence of this overcherishing, we were constantly liable to suffer from colds and sore throats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The young physician of whom I have already spoken became an inmate of our house soon after my mother's death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>My father was disposed to be extremely careful in the choice of our associates and intended, no doubt, that we should receive our education at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>At a later day his plans were changed somewhat, and after some experience of governesses and masters I was at last sent to a school in the near neighborhood of our house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I was <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> old at this time, somewhat precocious for my age, and endowed with a good memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>This fact may have led to my being at once placed in a class of girls much older than myself, especially occupied with the study of <persName n="Paley,,,,," id="n0298.0002.00013.00027" reg="mostcommon:Paley,William,,,:2"><surname>Paley</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Philosophy,,Moral,,," id="n0298.0002.00013.00028" reg="default:Philosophy,Moral,,,"><foreName>Moral</foreName> <surname>Philosophy</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The system of education followed at that time consisted largely in memorizing from the text-books then in use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The study of languages was very congenial to me; I had been accustomed to speak French from my earliest years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Her voice was beautiful in quality and of considerable extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It possessed a liquid and fluent flexibility, quite unlike the curious staccato and tremolo effects so much in favor to-day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>My father's views of religious duty became much more stringent after my mother's death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I had been twice taken to the opera during the <name>Garcia</name> performances, when I was scarcely more than <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> of age, and had seen and heard the <rs>Diva Malibran</rs>, then known as <persName n="Garcia,,Signorina,,," id="n0298.0002.00015.00041" reg="default:Garcia,Signorina,,,"><foreName>Signorina</foreName> <surname>Garcia</surname></persName>, in the roles of Cenerentola (Cinderella) and Rosina in the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Seviglia,,Barbiere,di,," id="n0298.0002.00015.00042" reg="default:Seviglia,Barbiere,di,,"><foreName>Barbiere</foreName> <foreName>di</foreName> <surname>Seviglia</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Soon after this time the doors were shut, and I knew of theatrical matters only by hearsay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The religious people of that period had set their faces against the drama in every form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>I remember the destruction by <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> fire of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Bowery Theatre, and how this was spoken of as a <q direct="unspecified">judgment</q> upon the wickedness of the stage and of its patrons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>A well-known theatre in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName>, took fire while a performance was going on, and the result was a deplorable loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The pulpits of the time <q direct="unspecified">improved</q> this event by sermons which reflected severely upon the frequenters of such places of amusement, and the <q direct="unspecified">judgment</q> was long spoken of with holy horror.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>My musical education, in spite of the limitations of opportunity just mentioned, was the best that the time could afford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>I had my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lessons from a a very irritable <name>French</name> artist, of whom I stood in such fear that I could remember nothing that he taught me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The early years of my youth were passed in the seclusion not only of home life, but of a home most carefully and jealously guarded from all that might be represented in the orthodox trinity of evil, the world, the flesh, and the devil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>My father had become deeply imbued with the religious ideas of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>He dreaded for his children the dissipations of fashionable society, and even the risks of general intercourse with the unsanctified many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>We wore trains, but had a set of cords by which we pulled them up in festoons, when we went to dance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Brocades were much worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>I wanted <num value="1">one</num>, but could not find <num value="1">one</num> at <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> the time, so I embroidered a pretty yellow sile dress of mine, and made a brocade of it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>His fine head was crowned with an abundance of silken curly hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>He always wore gold-bowed glasses, being very near-sighted, was a born humorist, and delighted in jest and hyperbole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>He found us seated in the drawing-room, <num value="1">one</num> evening, to receive a visit from a very shy professor of <orgName n="Brown University" type="university">Brown University</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The doctor was very temperate in everything except tea, which he drank in the green variety, in strong and copious libations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Indeed, he had no need of wine or other alcoholic stimulants, his temperament being almost incandescent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Overflowing as he was with geniality, he yet accommodated himself easily to the requirements of a sick room, and showed himself tender, vigilant, and most sympathetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/><num value="1">One</num> of these last, having been brought by him through an attack of cholera, was so much impressed with the kindness and skill of the doctor that he at once and for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time sent him a check in recognition of services that money could not repay.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Ladies often came to her seeking good servants, her recommendation being considered an all-sufficient security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Women out of place came to her seeking employment, which she often found for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>These acts of kindness, often involving a considerable expenditure of time and <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> trouble, the dear lady performed with no thought of recompense other than the assurance that she had been helpful to those who needed her assistance in manifold ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>In her new abode Auntie lived with careful economy, dispensing her simple hospitality with a generous hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>She was famous among her friends for delicious coffee and for excellent tea, which she always made herself, on the table.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>She sometimes invited friends for an evening party, but made it a point to invite those who were not her favorites for a separate occasion, not wishing to dilute her enjoyment of the chosen few, and, on the other hand, desiring not to hurt the feelings of any of her acquaintance by wholly leaving them out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>My father, having already added to his large house a spacious art gallery, now built a study, whose walls were entirely occupied by my brother's books.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>From what I have just said, it may rightly be inferred that my father was a man of fine tastes, inclined to generous and even lavish expenditure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>For <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> many years, as I have said, no alcoholic stimulant appeared on it. My father gave away by dozens the bottles of costly wine stored in his cellar, but neither tasted their contents nor allowed us to do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>If my brothers lingered over the morning meal, he would come in, hatted and booted for the day, and would say: <q direct="unspecified">Young gentlemen, I am glad that you can afford to take life so easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>I am old and must work for my living,</q> a speech which usually broke up our morning coterie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Dinner was served at <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, a light lunch abbreviating the fast for those at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>At <time value="7:30">half past 7</time> we sat down to tea, a meal of which toast, preserves, and cake formed the staple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>In the evening we usually sat together with books and needlework, often with an interlude of music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>An occasional lecture, concert, or evening party varied this routine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>My brothers went much into fashionable society, but my own participation in its doings came only after my father's death, and after the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> mourning which, according to the usage of those days, followed it. <pb id="p.48" n="48"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>My father retained the <rs>Puritan</rs> feeling with regard to <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>We were indeed indulged on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> with coffee and muffins at breakfast, but, besides the morning and afternoon services at church, we young folks were expected to attend the <num value="2">two</num> meetings of the <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday-school</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>In the evening, we sang hymns, and sometimes received a quiet visitor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>My readers, if I have any, may ask whether this restricted routine satisfied my mind, and whether I was at all sensible of the privileges which I really enjoyed, or ought to have enjoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>I must answer that, after my school-days, I greatly coveted an enlargement of intercourse with the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>I did not desire to be counted among <q direct="unspecified">fashionables,</q> but I did aspire to much greater freedom of association than was allowed me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Yet I seemed to myself like a young damsel of olden time, shut up within an enchanted castle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>And I must say that my dear father, with all his noble generosity and overweening affection, sometimes appeared to me as my jailer.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>His wit, social talent, and literary taste opened a new world to me, and enabled me to share some of the best results of his long residence in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>My father's jealous care of us was by no means the result of a disposition tending to social exclusiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>It proceeded, on the contrary, from an over-anxiety as to the moral and religious influences to which his children might become subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>His ideas of propriety were very strict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>He told me once that when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entered the office, he found it, like many others, a place where gossip circulated freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Several days passed without any news of him, although advertisements were soon posted and a <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> liberal reward offered to any <num value="1">one</num> who should discover his whereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Resolving that he would not return by that means of conveyance, he had found for himself a hiding-place on a hill commanding a view of the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>From this height of vantage he was able to observe the movements of the party which had brought him to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>When he saw the men reembark on the steamer, he felt himself secure from recapture, and managed to steal a horse and to find <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> his way back to his own people.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>The love of adventure and the example of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Byron</foreName></persName> had, no doubt, some part in his determination to cast in his lot with the <name>Greeks</name> in the memorable struggle which restored to them their national life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>But the solidity and value of the services which he rendered to that oppressed people showed in time that he was endowed, not only with the generous impulses of youth, but with the forethought of mature manhood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>After some years of gallant service, in which he shared all the privations of the little army, accustoming himself to the bivouac by night, to hunger, hard fare, and constant fighting by day, he became convinced that the <name>Greeks</name> were in danger of being reduced to submission by absolute starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>All the able-bodied men of the nation were in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>The <rs>Turks</rs> had devastated the land, and there were no hands to till <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>He founded, built up, and directed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> institution for their benefit known in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>This was a work of great difficulty, and <num value="1">one</num> for which the means at hand appeared utterly inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Like all inspired men, he brought into the enterprises of his day new ideas and a new spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Deep in his heart lay a sense of the dignity and ability of human nature, which forced him to reject the pauperizing methods then employed in regard to various classes of unfortunates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>The blind must not only be fed and housed and cared for; they must learn to make their lives useful to the community; they must be taught and trained to earn their own support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>Convent gardens and villas of the nobility occupied much space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>The city attracted mostly students and lovers of art. The studios of painters and sculptors were much visited, and wealthy patrons of the arts gave orders for many costly works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>I found his oratory somewhat overloud and emphatic for the small hall and limited attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>In argument he would <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> go over the same ground several times, always with new amplifications and illustrations of his subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>There was a dead weight of honesty and conviction in what he said, and it was this, perhaps, that chiefly gave him his command over an audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>His election had displaced a popular idol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>His views regarding the heated question of the time, the extension of slavery to the territories, were far in advance of those held by the majority of the senatorial body or by the community at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>His uncompromising method of attack, his fiery utterances, contrasting strangely with the unusual mildness of his disposition, exasperated the defenders of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>These, perhaps, seeing that he was no fighting man, may have supposed him deficient in personal courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>I passed the evening in great bodily discomfort, but managed to play quadrilles, waltzes, and the endless Virginia Reel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>When at last I reached home and my bed, the fever did come with a will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>He was now in a less aggressive frame of mind, and this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> meeting with him was the beginning of a much-valued friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>Our mutual interest in the <rs>Church</rs> of the <name>Disciples</name>, and our regard for its pastor were bonds which drew us together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>In the years that followed, he as well as we had little time for merry-making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>The telegram sent by him to the mayor of that city seemed to give an earnest of what we might expect from him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>The measures then taken by him were much derided; but, when the crisis came, the heart of the public went out to him in gratitude, for every emergency had been thought out and provided for.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>The governor now became a very busy man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>These exhausting labors, which continued throughout the <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> war, never disturbed the serenity of his countenance, always luminous with cheerfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>They were, no doubt, undermining his bodily vigor; but his devotion to public duty was such that he was well content to spend and be spent in its fulfillment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>I was present at the <rs type="place">State House</rs> when <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0298.0013.00263.01132" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,Albion,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> presented to the <orgName n="Massachusetts Legislature" type="legislature">legislature of Massachusetts</orgName> the parting gift of <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0298.0013.00263.01133" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>, &mdash;the gun which his grandfather had carried at the <rs n="Battle of Lexington" type="battle">battle of Lexington</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>After a brief but very appropriate address, the governor pressed the gun to his lips before giving it into the keeping of the official guardian of such treasures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>This scene was caricatured in <num value="1">one</num> of the public prints of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>I remember it as most impressive.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>The record of our State during the war was a <pb id="p.265" n="265"/> proud <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>The repeated calls for men and for money were always promptly and generously answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>I heard much of this at the time, especially from my husband, who was greatly attached to the governor, and who himself took an intense interest in all the operations of the war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/>His cast of mind was more metaphysical than logical, and he delighted in paradox.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>In his writings he would sometimes overstate greatly, in order to be sure of impressing his meaning upon his readers or hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>Himself a devout <name>Christian</name>, he nevertheless once said, speaking on Sunday in the <rs>Church</rs> of the <name>Disciples</name>, that the moral law and the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName> were the meanest of inventions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>It was not numerously attended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>The speakers all read their discourses from manuscript.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>The general tone was timid and subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>Something was said regarding the then recent Franco-Prussian war, and the growing humanity shown by both of the contending parties in the mutual arrangements for taking care of the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>I presented my credentials, and asked leave to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>With some embarrassment, I was told that I might speak to the officers of the society, when the public meeting should be adjourned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>I accordingly met a dozen or more of these gentlemen in a side room, where I simply spoke of my endeavors to enlist the sympathies and efforts of women in behalf of the world's peace.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>As well as I can remember, each day of the congress had its own president, and not the least interesting of these days was that on which <persName n="Manning,,Cardinal,,," id="n0298.0016.00339.01501" reg="default:Manning,Cardinal,,,"><foreName>Cardinal</foreName> <surname>Manning</surname></persName> presided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/>I remember well his domed forehead and pale, transparent complexion, telling unmistakably of his ascetic life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>He was obviously much interested in Prison Reform, and well cognizant of its progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>An esteemed friend and fellow country-woman of mine, <persName n="Chace,Mrs.,Elizabeth,B.,," id="n0298.0016.00339.01502" reg="default:Chace,Elizabeth,B.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Elizabeth</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Chace</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, was also accredited as a delegate to this congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>At <num value="1">one</num> of its meetings she read a short paper, giving some account of her own work in the prisons of her State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3358"/>At this meeting, the question of flogging prisoners came up, and a rather brutal jailer of the <orgName n="Old School" type="school">old school</orgName> told an anecdote of a refractory prisoner who had been easily reduced to obedience by this summary method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3359"/>His rough words stirred my heart within me.

<p>My words were much applauded, and I think the vote taken was against the punishment in question. . The sittings of the congress were mainly held in the hall of the <rs type="place">Temple</rs>, which is enriched with carvings and coats of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>Here, also, a final banquet was held, at which I was invited to speak, and did so. <persName n="Wines,Reverend,Frederick,,," id="n0298.0016.00340.01506" reg="default:Wines,Frederick,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Wines</surname></persName> had an honored place in this assembly, and his words were listened to with great attention.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3370"/>A number of the addresses presented at the congress were in foreign languages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3371"/>A synopsis of these was furnished on the spot by an apt translator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>I recall the whole occasion as <num value="1">one</num> of great interest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>The meetings at which I spoke in different parts of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were usually presided over by some important personage, such as the mayor of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion a man of the people, quite popular in his way, expressed his warm approval of my peace doctrine, and concluded his remarks by saying, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Howe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0298.0016.00341.01509" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Julia,Ward,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>, I offer you the hand of the Tyne-side Orator.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/></p> 
<p>All these efforts were intended to lead up to the final meeting which I had determined to hold in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, and which I did hold in <placeName reg="St. George's Hall">St. George's Hall</placeName>, a place very suitable for such occasions.

The attendance was very good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>The meeting was by no means what I had hoped that it might be. The ladies who spoke in public in those days mostly confined their labors to the advocacy of woman suffrage, and were not much interested in my scheme of a world-wide protest of women against the cruelties of war. I found indeed some helpful allies among my own sex. <num value="2">Two</num> sisters of John Bright, <persName n="Lucas,Mrs.,Margaret,,," id="n0298.0016.00341.01513" reg="default:Lucas,Margaret,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Lucas</surname></persName> and <persName n="Maclaren,Mrs.,,,," id="n0298.0016.00341.01514" reg="mostcommon:Maclaren,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Maclaren</surname></persName>, aided me with various friendly offices, and through their instrumentality <pb id="p.342" n="342"/> the money which I had expended in the hire of halls was returned to me. I had not in any way suggested or expected this, but as I was working entirely at my own cost the assistance was very welcome and opportune.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>I cannot leave this time without recalling the gracious figure of <persName n="Coquerel,,Athanase,,," id="n0298.0016.00342.01515" reg="default:Coquerel,Athanase,,,"><foreName>Athanase</foreName> <surname>Coquerel</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/>I had met this remarkable man in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> at the anniversary banquet of the <rs>British Unitarian Association</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>It was in this country, however, that I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> heard his eloquent and convincing speech, the occasion being a sermon given by him at the <orgName n="Unitarian Church" type="church">Unitarian Church of <placeName reg="Newport, Newport, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7014221">Newport, R.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>He consented to do so, and in <num value="1">one</num> of his discourses represented the <name>Commune</name> as the result of a state of exasperation on the part of the people of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>They saw their country invaded by hostile armies, their sacred city beleaguered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>In the desperation of their distress, all longed to take active part in some counter movement, and the most brutal and ignorant part of the populace were turned, by artful leaders, to this work of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3395"/>The speaker gave a very moving account of the hardships of the siege of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, the privations endured of food and fuel, the sacrifice of costly furniture as fire-wood to keep alive children in imminent danger of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3396"/>In the midst of the tumults and horrors enumerated, he introduced the description of the funeral of an eminent scientist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>The quiet cortege moved on to the cemetery where halt was made, and the several speakers of the occasion, as if oblivious of the agonies of the hour, bore willing testimony to the merits and good work of their departed colleague.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>This I did very reluctantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>I was now face to face with a new order of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>Here, indeed, were some whom I had long known and honored: <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0298.0018.00375.01575" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:2"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0298.0018.00375.01576" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, <persName n="Higginson,Colonel,,,," id="n0298.0018.00375.01577" reg="nearbymention:Higginson,Thomas,Wentworth,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Higginson</surname></persName>, and my dear pastor, <persName n="Clarke,,James,Freeman,," id="n0298.0018.00375.01578" reg="default:Clarke,James,Freeman,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>Freeman</foreName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>As I looked into her sweet, womanly face and heard her earnest voice, I felt that the object of my distaste had been a mere phantom, conjured up by silly and senseless misrepresentations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>Here stood the true woman, pure, noble, great-hearted, with the light of her good life shining in every feature of her face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>Here, too, I saw the husband whose devotion so ably seconded her life-work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>The arguments to which I now listened were simple, strong, and convincing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>These champions, who had fought so long and so valiantly for the slave, now turned the searchlight of their intelligence upon the condition of woman, and demanded for the mothers of the community the civil rights which had recently been accorded to the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>They asked for nothing more and nothing less than the administration of that impartial justice for which, if for anything, a Republican government should stand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>When they requested me to speak, which they did presently, I could only say, <q direct="unspecified">I am with you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/><pb id="p.376" n="376"/> I have been with them ever since, and have never seen any reason to go back from the pledge then given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>Strangely, as it then seemed to me, the arguments which I had stored up in my mind against the political enfranchisement of women were really so many reasons in its favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>All that I had felt regarding the sacredness and importance of the woman's part in private life now appeared to me equally applicable to the part which she should bear in public life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/><num value="1">One</num> of the comforts which I found in the new association was the relief which it afforded me from a sense of isolation and eccentricity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>For years past I had felt strongly impelled to lend my voice to the convictions of my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>I had done this in a way, from time to time, always with the feeling that my course in so doing was held to call for apology and explanation by the men and women with whose opinions I had hitherto been familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>I now found a sphere of action in which this mode of expression no longer appeared singular or eccentric, but simple, natural, and, under the circumstances, inevitable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>In the little band of workers which I had joined, I was soon called upon to perform yeoman's service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>Among those <pb id="p.377" n="377"/> who led or followed the new movement, I naturally encountered some individuals in whom vanity and personal ambition were conspicuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>But I found mostly among my new associates a great heart of religious conviction and a genuine spirit of selfsacrifice.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>Among the manifold interests which now opened up before me, the cause of woman suffrage was for a time predominant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3766"/>We acted, <num value="1">one</num> and all, under the powerful stimulus of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3767"/>The object which we labored to accomplish was so legitimate and rational, so directly in the line of our religious belief, of our political institutions, that it appeared as if we had only to unfold our new banner, bright with the <pb id="p.379" n="379"/> blazon of applied Christianity, and march on to victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3777"/>Ministers opened to us their churches, and the women of their congregations worked together to provide for us places of refreshment and repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3783"/>At <num value="1">one</num> town in <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName> some opposition to our coming had been manifested beforehand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3784"/>We found, on arriving, that the chairman of our <orgName n="Arrangements Committee" type="committee">committee of arrangements</orgName> had left town suddenly as if unwilling to befriend us. A vulgar and silly ballad had been printed and circulated, in which we <num value="3">three</num> ladies were spoken of as <num value="3">three</num> old crows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3785"/>The prospect for the evening was not encouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3786"/>We deliberated for a moment in the anteroom of our hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3792"/>I read my paper without interruption.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3794"/>I remember another journey, a nocturnal <num value="1">one</num>, which I undertook alone, in order to join the friends mentioned above at a suffrage meeting somewhere in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3795"/>As I emerged from the <name>Pullman</name> in the cold twilight of an early winter morning, carrying a heavy bag, and feeling friendless and forlorn, I met <persName n="Livermore,Mrs.,,,," id="n0298.0018.00381.01596" reg="nearbymention:Livermore,Mary,A.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Livermore</surname></persName>, who had made the journey in another car.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3796"/>Moved by this appeal, she at once took me under her protection, ordered a hotel porter to relieve me of my bag, and saw me comfortably housed and provided for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> of these who, after asking to be heard, began to read from an elaborate manuscript which had evidently been written for her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3812"/></p> 
<p>This dictum, pronounced in a most authoritative manner, at once brought to my mind the <pb id="p.384" n="384"/> homely proverb, <q direct="unspecified">What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander;</q> and I could not help asking permission to suggest a single question, upon which a prominent <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> lawyer instantly replied: <q direct="unspecified">No, <persName n="Howe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0298.0018.00384.01611" reg="mostcommon:Howe,Maud,,,:3"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>, you may not [speak].

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>I think that the congress held in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> in the <name>Centennial</name> year was the occasion of her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> presiding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>Her customary manner had in it a little of the <rs>Quaker</rs> shyness, but when she appeared upon the platform the power of command, or rather of control, appeared in all that she said or did. In figure she was erect and above middle height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>Her dress was a rich black silk, made after a plain but becoming fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>The contrast between her silver curls and black eyes was striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>Her voice was harmonious, her manner at once gracious and decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>The question of commencing proceedings with prayer having been raised, <persName n="Mitchell,Miss,,,," id="n0298.0018.00387.01629" reg="nearbymention:Mitchell,Maria,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> invited those present to unite in a silent prayer, a form of worship common among the <name>Friends</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>The impression made by our meetings was such that we soon began to receive letters from distant parts of the country, inviting us to journey hither and thither, and to hold our congresses <name>east</name>, <name>west</name>, <name>north</name>, and <name>south</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>Our year's work was arranged by committees, which had reference severally to science, art, education, industrial training, reforms, and statistics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>Our association certainly seemed to have answered an existing need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>Leading women from many States joined us, and we distributed our congresses as widely as the limits of our purses <pb id="p.388" n="388"/> would allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/>Journeys to <placeName reg="Utah" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName> and <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> were beyond the means of most of our workers, and we regretfully declined invitations received from friends in these States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>In our earlier years our movements were mainly <name>west</name> and <name>east</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>We soon felt, however, that we must make acquaintance with our Southern sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>In the face of some discouragement, we arranged to hold a congress in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and had every reason to be satisfied with its result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> followed on our list of Southern States, and the progressive women of <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName> accorded us a warm welcome and a <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> hearing in <num value="1">one</num> of the finest churches of the city.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3860"/>Among the many mind-pictures left by our congresses, let me here outline <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3861"/>The place is the court-house of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis, Tenn.</placeName>, which has been temporarily ceded for our use. The time is that of <num value="1">one</num> of our public sessions, and the large audience is waiting in silent expectancy, when the entrance of a quaint figure attracts all eyes to the platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3862"/>It is that of a woman of middle height and past middle age, dressed in plain black, her nearly white hair cut short, and surmounted by a sort of student's cap <pb id="p.389" n="389"/> of her own devising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3863"/>Her appearance at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> borders on the grotesque, but is presently seen to be nearer the august.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3864"/>She turns her pleasant face toward the audience, takes off her cap, and unrolls the manuscript from which she proposes to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3865"/>Her eyes beam with intelligence and kindly feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3866"/>The spectators applaud her before she has opened her lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>Her aspect has taken them captive at once.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3868"/>Her essay, on some educational theme, is terse, direct, and full of good thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3869"/>It is heard with close attention and with manifest approbation, and whenever, in the proceedings that follow, she rises to say her word, she is always greeted with a murmur of applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3870"/>This lady is <persName n="Ripley,Miss,Mary,,," id="n0298.0018.00389.01630" reg="default:Ripley,Mary,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName>, a public school teacher of <placeName key="tgn,2204339" n="1.000 1" reg="buffalo city, wisconsin">Buffalo city</placeName>, wise in the instruction of the young and in the enlightenment of elders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3871"/>We all rejoice in her success, which is eminently that of character and intellect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3872"/>I feel myself drawn on to offer another picture, not of our congress, but of a scene which grew out of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3873"/>The ladies of our association have been invited to visit a school for young girls, of which <persName n="Conway,Miss,,,," id="n0298.0018.00389.01631" reg="mostcommon:Conway,Miss,,,:1"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Conway</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of our members, is the principal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3874"/>After witnessing some interesting exercises, we assemble in the large hall, where a novel entertainment has been provided for us. A band of <pb id="p.390" n="390"/> <num value="12">twelve</num> young ladies appear upon the platform They wear the colors of <q direct="unspecified">Old Glory,</q> but after a new fashion, <num value="4">four</num> of them being arrayed from head to foot in red, <num value="4">four</num> in blue, and <num value="4">four</num> in white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3875"/>While the <rs>John Brown</rs> tune is heard from the piano, they proceed to act in graceful dumb show the stanzas of my <persName n="Hymn,,Battle,,," id="n0298.0018.00390.01632" reg="default:Hymn,Battle,,,"><foreName>Battle</foreName> <surname>Hymn</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3876"/>How they did it I cannot tell, but it was a most lovely performance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3877"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1898--"><year reg="1898">1898</year></dateStruct>, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time since its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting, our association issued no call for a congress of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3878"/>The reasons for our failure to do so may be briefly stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3879"/>Some of our most efficient members had been removed by death, some by unavoidable circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3880"/>But more than this, the demands made upon the time and strength of women by the women's clubs, which are now numerous and universal, had come to occupy the attention of many who in other times had leisure to interest themselves in our work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3881"/>The biennial conventions of the <orgName n="General Federation" type="federation">general federation</orgName> of women's clubs no doubt appear to many to fill the place which we have honorably held, and may in some degree answer the ends which we have always had in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3882"/>Yet a number of us still hold together, united in heart and in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3883"/>Although we have sadly missed our departed friends, I have never felt that the interest or value of our meetings suffered any decline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3884"/><pb id="p.391" n="391"/> The spirit of those dear ones has seemed, on the contrary, to abide among us, holding us pledged to undertake the greater effort made necessary by their absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3885"/>We still count among our members many who keep the inspiration under which we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> took the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3886"/>We feel, moreover, that our happy experience of many years has brought us lessons too precious to hide or to neglect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3887"/>The coming together either of men or of women from regions widely separate from each other naturally gives occasion for comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3888"/>So far as I have known, the comparisons elicited by our meetings have more and more tended to resolve imagined discords into prevailing harmony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3889"/>The sympathy of feeling aroused by our unity of object has always risen above the distinctions of section and belonging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3890"/>Honest differences of opinion, honestly and temperately expressed, tend rather to develop good feeling than to disturb it. I am glad to be able to say that sectional prejudice has appeared very little, if at all, in the long course of our congresses, and that selfglorifica-tion, whether of State or individual, has never had any place with us, while the great instruction of meeting with earnest and thoughtful workers from every part of our country's vast domain has been greatly appreciated by us and by those who, in various places, have met with us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3891"/>We have presented at our meetings reports on <pb id="p.392" n="392"/> a variety of important topics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3892"/>Our congress of <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> usually concluding on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, such of our speakers as are accustomed to the pulpit have often been invited to hold forth in <num value="1">one</num> or more of the churches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3893"/>In <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville, Tenn.</placeName>, for example, I was cordially bidden to lift up my voice in an orthodox <orgName n="Presbyterian Church" type="church">Presbyterian church</orgName>, <persName n="Cheney,Mrs.,Ednah,D.,," id="n0298.0018.00392.01633" reg="default:Cheney,Ednah,D.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Ednah</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Cheney</surname></persName> spoke before the <orgName n="Unitarian Society" type="society">Unitarian society</orgName>, <persName n="Blackwell,Reverend,Antoinette,Brown,," id="n0298.0018.00392.01634" reg="default:Blackwell,Antoinette,Brown,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Antoinette</foreName> <foreName>Brown</foreName> <surname>Blackwell</surname></persName> preached to yet another congregation, and <persName n="Wolcott,Mrs.,Henrietta,L.,T.," id="n0298.0018.00392.01635" reg="default:Wolcott,Henrietta,L.,T.,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Henrietta</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Wolcott</surname></persName> improved the <name>Sunday</name> by a very interesting talk on waifs, of which class of unfortunates she has had much official and personal knowledge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3894"/>An extended account of our many meetings would be out of place in this volume, but some points in connection with them may be of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>It often happened that we visited cities in which no associations of women, other than the church and temperance societies, existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>After our departure, women's clubs almost invariably came into being.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/>Our eastern congresses have been held in <placeName reg="Portland, Cumberland, Maine" key="tgn,7014272">Portland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3901"/>In the south, as already said, our pilgrimages have reached <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3902"/><pb id="p.393" n="393"/></p> 
<p>We have sometimes been requested to supplement our annual congress by an additional day's session at some place easily reached from the city in which the main meeting had been appointed to be held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3903"/>Of these supplementary congresses I will mention a very pleasant one at <placeName reg="Saint Paul, Ramsey, Minnesota" key="tgn,7013947">St. Paul, Minn.</placeName>, and a very useful <num value="1">one</num> held by some of our number in <placeName reg="Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,7013960">Salt Lake City</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3904"/>At the congress held in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1879--"><year reg="1879">1879</year></dateStruct>, I was elected president, my predecessor in the office, <persName n="Daggett,Mrs.,,,," id="n0298.0018.00393.01637" reg="nearbymention:Daggett,Kate,Newell,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Daggett</surname></persName>, declining further service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3905"/>As the years have gone on, Death has done his usual work upon our number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3906"/>I have already spoken of our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="Mitchell,President,Maria,,," id="n0298.0018.00393.01638" reg="default:Mitchell,Maria,,,"><roleName n="President">president</roleName>, <foreName>Maria</foreName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, who continued, after her term of office, to send us valuable statements regarding the scientific work of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3908"/>The record in our calendar is that of an earnest worker, well fitted to commend the woman's cause by her attractive presence and cultivated mind.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3910"/>She excelled in judgment, and in the sense of measure and of fitness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3911"/>Her sober taste in dress did not always commend her to our assemblage, composed largely of women, but the <pb id="p.394" n="394"/> plainness of her garb was redeemed by the beauty of her classic head and by the charm of her voice and manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3912"/>She was grave in demeanor, but with an undertone of genuine humor which showed her to be truly human.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3913"/>She was the worthy cousin of <persName n="May,Reverend,Samuel,Joseph,," id="n0298.0018.00394.01641" reg="default:May,Samuel,Joseph,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>May</surname></persName>, and is remembered by me as the crown of a family of more than common distinction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3914"/>The progress of the woman question naturally developed a fresh interest in the industrial capacity of the sex. Experts in these matters know that the work of woman enters into almost every department of service and of manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3915"/>In order to make this more evident, it seemed advisable to ask that a separate place might be assigned at some of the great industrial fairs, for the special showing of the inventions and handicraft of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3916"/>Such a space was conceded to us at <num value="1">one</num> of the important fairs held in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct>, and I was invited to become president of this, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> recognized Woman's Department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3917"/>In this work I received valuable aid from <persName n="Wolcott,Mrs.,Henrietta,L.,T.," id="n0298.0018.00394.01642" reg="default:Wolcott,Henrietta,L.,T.,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Henrietta</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Wolcott</surname></persName>, who, in the capacity of treasurer, was able to exercise a constant supervision over the articles consigned to our care.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3918"/>On the opening day of the fair <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0298.0018.00394.01643" reg="mostcommon:Butler,Josephine,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, who was then governor of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, presided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3919"/>In introducing me, he said, in a playfully apologetic manner, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Howe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0298.0018.00394.01644" reg="mostcommon:Howe,Maud,,,:3"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName> may say some <pb id="p.395" n="395"/> things which we might not wish to hear, but it is my office to present her to this audience.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3920"/>He probably thought that I was about to speak of woman suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3921"/>My address, however, did not touch upon that topic, but upon the present new departure, its value and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3922"/><persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0298.0018.00395.01645" reg="mostcommon:Butler,Josephine,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, indeed, sometimes claimed to be a friend of woman suffrage, but <num value="1">one</num> of our number said of him in homely phrase: <q direct="unspecified">He only wants to have his dish right side up when it rains.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3923"/></p> 
<p>The most noticeable points in our exhibit were, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the number of useful articles invented by women; secondly, a very creditable exhibition of scientific work, largely contributed by the lady students and graduates of the <orgName n="Technology Massachusetts Institute" type="institute">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</orgName>; lastly, a collection of books composed by women, among which were some volumes of quite ancient date.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3924"/>I suppose that my connection with this undertaking led to my receiving and accepting an invitation to assume the presidency of a woman's department in a great World's Fair to be held in New Orleans in the late <rs type="season">autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> of <dateStruct value="1883--"><year reg="1883">1883</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1884--"><year reg="1884">84</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3925"/>Coupled with this invitation was the promise of a sum of money amply sufficient to defray all the expenses involved in the management of so extensive a work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3926"/>My daughter <persName><foreName>Maud</foreName></persName> was also engaged to take charge of an alcove especially devoted to the literary work of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3927"/><pb id="p.396" n="396"/></p> 
<p>We arrived in New Orleans in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, and found our affairs at a standstill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3928"/>Our <q direct="unspecified">chief of exposition,</q> as she was called, <persName n="Cloudman,Mrs.,,,," id="n0298.0018.00396.01646" reg="mostcommon:Cloudman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Cloudman</surname></persName>, had measured and marked off the spaces requisite for the exhibits of the several States, but no timber was forthcoming with which to erect the necessary stands, partitions, etc. On inquiry, I was told that the funds obtained in support of the enterprise had proved insufficient, and that some expected contributions had failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3929"/>There was naturally some censure of the manner in which the resources actually at hand had been employed, and some complaining of citizens of New Orleans who had been expected to contribute <num value="1000">thousands</num> of dollars to the exposition, and who had subscribed only a few hundreds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3930"/>I proceeded at once to organize a board of direction for the department, composed of the lady commissioners in charge of exhibits from their several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3931"/><num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of these ladies objected to the separate showing of woman's work, and were allowed to place their goods in the general exhibit of their States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3932"/>I had friendly relations with these ladies, but they were not under my jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3933"/>Our embarrassing deadlock lasted for some time, but at length a benevolent lumber dealer endowed us with <measure n="3000feet" type="distance">three thousand feet</measure> of pine boards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3934"/>The management furnished no workman for us, but the commanders of <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.397" n="397"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> warships in the harbor lent us the services of their ship-carpenters, and in process of time the long gallery set apart for our use was partitioned off in pretty alcoves, draped with bright colors, and filled with every variety of handiwork.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3935"/>I was fond of showing, among other novelties, a heavy iron chain, forged by a woman-blacksmith, and a set of fine jewelry, entirely made by women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3936"/>The exposition was a very valuable <num value="1">one</num>, and did not fail to attract a large concourse of people from all parts of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3937"/>In the great multitude of things to be seen, and in the crowded attendance, visitors were easily confused, and often failed to find matters which might most interest them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3938"/>In order to improve the opportunity offered, I bethought me of a series of short talks on the different exhibits, to be given either by the commissioners in charge of them, or by experts whose services could be secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3939"/>These <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> talks, as they were called, became very popular, and were continued during the greater part of the season.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3940"/>In the same gallery with ourselves was the exhibit made by the colored people of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4114"/>An <name>English</name> clergyman whom we had met in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> happened to be in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> at this time, and <num value="1">one</num> day informed us that he had had some correspondence with <persName n="Dore,,,,," id="n0298.0020.00417.01764" reg="mostcommon:Dore,Gustave,,,:1"><surname>Dore</surname></persName>, and had suggested to the latter a painting of the <name>Resurrection</name> from a new point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4115"/>This should represent, not the opening grave, but the gates of heaven unclosing to receive the ascending form of the <rs>Master</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4116"/>The artist had promised to illustrate this subject, and our new friend invited us to accompany him to the studio, where he hoped to find the picture well advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4117"/>Accordingly, on a day appointed, we knocked at the artist's door and were admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4118"/>The apartment was vast, well proportioned to the unusual size of many of the works of art which hung upon the walls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4119"/><persName n="Dore,,,,," id="n0298.0020.00417.01765" reg="mostcommon:Dore,Gustave,,,:1"><surname>Dore</surname></persName> received us with cordiality, and showed Mr.&mdash;&mdash;the picture which he had suggested, already nearly completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4120"/>He appeared to be about <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> of age, in figure above medium height, well set up and balanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4121"/>His eyes were blue, his hair dark, his facial expression very genial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4122"/>After some conversation with the <rs>English</rs> visitor, he led the way to his latest composition, which represented the van of a traveling showman, in front of which stood its proprietor, holding in his arms the body of his little child, just dead, in the middle of his performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4123"/>Beside <pb id="p.418" n="418"/> him stood his wife, in great grief, and at her feet the trick dogs, fantastically dressed, showed in their brute countenances the sympathy which those animals often evince when made aware of some misfortune befalling their master.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4124"/>Here we also saw a model of the enormous vase which the artist had sent to the exposition of that year (<dateStruct value="1879--"><year reg="1879">1879</year></dateStruct>), and which <persName n="Story,,William,W.,," id="n0298.0020.00418.01766" reg="default:Story,William,W.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Story</surname></persName> contemptuously called <q direct="unspecified">Doreas bottle.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4125"/></p> 
<p>The artist professed himself weary of painting for the moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4126"/>He seemed to have taken much interest in his recent modeling, and called our attention to a genius cast in bronze, which he had hoped that the municipality would have purchased for the illumination of the <q direct="unspecified">Place de l'opera.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4127"/>The head was surrounded by a coronet intended to give forth jets of flame, while the wings and body should be outlined by lights of another color.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4128"/>In the course of conversation, I remarked to him that his artistic career must have begun early in life.

<p>I believe that Doreas works are severely dealt with by art critics, and especially by such of them as are themselves artists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4133"/>Whatever may be the defects of his work, I feel sure that he has produced some paintings which deserve to live in the public esteem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4134"/>Among these I would include his picture of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0298.0020.00419.01767" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s Entry into <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>, for the contrast therein shown between the popular enthusiasm and the indifference of a group of richly dressed women, seated in a balcony, and according no attention whatever to the procession passing in the street just below them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4135"/>Worthy to be mentioned with this is his painting of Francesca da Rimini and her lover, as <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0298.0020.00419.01768" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName> saw them in his vision of hell.
