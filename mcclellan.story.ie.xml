<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>No volunteer in the army made greater personal sacrifices.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He found <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> in a perilous condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The defeat at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> had demoralized the administration and the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>No <num value="1">one</num> had formed any, the most vague, idea of what was to be done or how to do anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Up to this time the administration had shared with the people of the <rs>North</rs> and an unconsidering press the opinion that the rebellion was but a mob, to be scattered in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> free fights by impetuous onsets of patriotic men. Now the shout, <quote>On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,</quote> had been suddenly and appallingly hushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Paralysis had followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The military condition of the whole country, <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> alone excepted, was chaotic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Probably there were other men in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> as well fitted by natural ability and education for the great work in hand, but they did not appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>No other <num value="1">one</num> has been indicated as the proper man for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>That occasion demanded a calm foresight of the vast needs of the country in the coming, the then present, peril, the ability to provide for every <num value="1">one</num> of them, and &mdash; the expression is homely but precise &mdash; the staying power to make the provision perfectly, calmly, completely, unmoved by the cries, however honest and anxious, of an alarmed people, equally unmoved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>by the criticisms of the envious and the clamors of the unprincipled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If the wisdom which sought the ablest military advice in that moment of alarm had been displayed throughout the war by entrusting to military knowledge and ability the conduct of campaigns and the direction and execution of the work of war, the expense of treasure and blood would have been vastly less, and the end would have been much more speedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Instead of this, after <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00003.00020" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had assured the safety of the capital, and the alarm of the civilians had subsided, they assumed the direction, interfered with and delayed military preparations, and undertook the specific management of campaigns and armies, while they took care that the delays and defeats which they caused should be charged on soldiers in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We who were then living can with the utmost difficulty carry our minds back to the conditions under which <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00003.00021" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was called to save the capital and country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is impossible for the present generation to realize the blindness of the people or appreciate the prevision of the young general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>We now look back to all that which he foresaw, foretold, and provided for. So intense had been popular, feeling that it was regarded: <pb id="p.4" n="4"/>as treason to think or say that secession was in great strength, that the <rs>South</rs> would not be easily conquered,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He was alone in the clear atmosphere, above the scene of physical and political warfare, and saw what others could not or would not see. <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0000.00004.00022" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:25"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> probably came nearer to accepting his views than any <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>From this time on the <rs>President</rs> reposed confidence in him; and there is small reason for doubt that, but for the interference of politicians, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00004.00023" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:25"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00004.00024" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> would have brought the war to an end in the summer of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Both were threatened with division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He desired to save both, probably believing that the unity of his party was essential to the saving of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>In this view can be explained much which is otherwise inexplicable in his dealings with the general, to whom up to the very last he gave the most frank and full private assurances of his confidence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The <quote>staying</quote> powers of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00004.00026" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> were the salvation of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Alone in his outlook, he was alone in the execution of his great work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The fortification of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> accomplished, and a sufficient force organized and disciplined for its defence, he directed his labors to the next great need &mdash; an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The people, the sovereigns, had not the remotest conception of the meaning of the word <quote>army.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Very few soldiers in this country had grasped the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>No <num value="1">one</num> but <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00004.00027" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had observed that the able and educated soldiers of the <rs>South</rs> had long been organizing that vast machine which, once created, moves with irresistible force over all obstacles until met by another machine of like construction and greater power, or which is handled with greater skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> grew like a vast engine constructed by a master-mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Its history is the reward of the constructor, ample, and the only reward he ever received.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> characteristic of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00004.00028" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s mind which some would regard as a defect, and which certainly placed him at a disadvantage in his relations with the men in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He was slow to suspect evil of any man. This trait was exhibited in his private life, and he never wholly lost it. The philosophic reader will find interest in the indications afforded in his letters of his gradual awakening to the controlling presence in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> of a class of men known as politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Soldiers, accustomed to honest service for definite purposes, imbued with high principles of honor, can with difficulty recognize the existence of men in public life who are willing to manage public interests for private or party gain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>He knew the past history of his country by heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>He remembered the illustrious names and records of men whose high ambition had been to serve the people as statesmen, whom no <num value="1">one</num> had ever thought to charge with personal or party motive in any of their acts as trustees and representatives of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Was the day of such American senators and representatives gone by?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Was legislation henceforth to be for the perpetuation of hold on office, for the success of party, with the mere pretence of good to country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Now that the general trust of governmental powers had <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>become a specific trust of blood to be poured out and treasure to be expended for the salvation of the <rs>Union</rs>, it did not occur to him that any of the trustees could dream of using that treasure and blood for personal advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>When men professed honest patriotism he believed them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Nor do the people themselves, in times of excitement, yield readily to the belief that among their leaders are some who are not honest and patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>But in calm retrospect they are generally more wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It would not be difficult already to make a Catalogue of names of men who were prominent in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and elsewhere during the war, who secured for the time the reputation of patriotic leaders of opinion and directors of events, whose memories have been allowed, as they deserved, to rot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The charge was not infrequently made that he intended to seize the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The devotion of the army to him, with their indignation at his and their treatment by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, might arouse apprehension in minds not noted for personal courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Possibly such apprehension had something to do with the holding out to the general the idea that he was to command the combined forces, and with the adoption of the plan of withdrawing the army from his command instead of relieving him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The falsehood was afterward circulated that he hesitated and sought to make conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>In each case he ascertained that the offer was made by a majority over a minority who had strong prejudices against him and opposed his appointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>There was what men call a magnetism about him which won all hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>To politicians such a man, honest and unapproachable, is always a subject of apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Party politicians, Democrats as well as Republicans, feared him as a possible rival or opponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>A sharp attack of the same acute pain suddenly seized him. The physician summoned to his side administered remedies, but the agony continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>He left his bed for a large chair in which he sat. No expression of suffering escaped him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Whatever be their judgment of the soldier and statesman, few if any <pb id="p.18" n="18"/>outside of the circle of his intimate friends have had any idea of the real man. Public men are too often measured by the familiar standards of public life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>He was a man such as we seldom know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>His experiences in life were varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Educated as a soldier, he had devoted his life to his profession, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the most accomplished military scholars of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>His military library was large, in various languages, always increasing, every book thoroughly studied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>He continued these studies faithfully to his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Military operations in every part of the world commanded his close observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>He supplied himself with maps and all information in current literature, followed movements of armies, kept himself familiar with every phase of campaigns, whether in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in Afghanistan, in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, or in <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">South Africa</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>While this was his professional study, he occupied himself with almost equally thorough study of subjects very &mdash; remote from military matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He was a general student of the literature of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>He read freely most of the languages of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and kept up with the progress of thought and discussion in history, philosophy, and art. He was especially interested in archeology, and, having all his life retained and used his knowledge of ancient languages, found abundant delight in reading archaeologic publications and in following the work of explorers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>In all departments of scholarly reading, he was constant and unwearying, and he never forgot what he had once learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Fitted by his attainments for the society of the learned, he had the marked characteristic of the true scholar &mdash; the desire to know more, and therefore the habit of seeking instead of offering information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Few suspected his mastery of subjects on which he only asked questions when thrown in contact with recognized masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>In general conversation he more frequently sought information than gave it; but when drawn out to give it his expression was concise, vigorous, clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>His extended knowledge of ancient and modern languages made him master of his own. His public papers are models of pure style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>His habit of writing was swift, and he never hesitated for the precise word to express the exact shade of meaning he intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>His despatch-books, containing the autograph originals of his despatches during the war, are marvels, since, with whatever haste he wrote, he wrote without erasure or alteration on subjects where each word was of vital importance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>That his life was <num value="1">one</num> of constant occupation may be judged from what has been said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>He had no idle hours &mdash; for those cannot be called idle which were given to social duties and the enjoyments of that home life whose beauty and happiness were perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>His wife and children were his companions, and a perpetual sunshine was in the household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>He was full of cheer, life, vigor, always ready for whatever would make any <num value="1">one</num> of them happy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>And this leads me to say that of all men I have ever known <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00018.00117" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was the most unselfish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Neither in his public life nor in his private life did he ever seek anything for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>He was constantly doing something for some <num value="1">one</num> else; always seeking to do good, confer pleasure, relieve sorrow, gratify a whim, do something for another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>He had his own <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>amusements, but in those he sought the good of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>He had devoted a great deal of attention to ceramic art, and had collected many fine examples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>He was an excellent judge of genuineness of specimens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>But his love of <quote>old china</quote> was not for mere pleasure &mdash; it was for historical and industrial considerations; and <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> owes him a vastly larger debt than she knows for the great advance made in her pottery productions through his special personal efforts while and after he was governor of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>They were a vast family, and not a few of them came to him for aid in distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>None came in vain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>His charity was abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>He sympathized with every <num value="1">one</num> who was in trouble or sorrow; and his sympathy was practical and useful, for his person and his purse were devoted to its uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>An <name>Irish</name> servant in a New York house saw her brother's name in the list of killed at <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName>, and started off forthwith to find his grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>When she came back she told her story to the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>She found her way to the battle-field, and after a while to the graves where some <num value="1">one</num> told her the men of her brother's regiment were buried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>It was a lonesome place above ground then, for the army had moved away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>She was searching among the graves for a familiar name on the stakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>when she saw, riding down the road which passed at some distance from the burial place, what she called a lot of soldiers on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>When they came abreast of her the leader, who was a little in advance, called a halt, sprang to the ground, and walked across the open field to her. <quote>What are you looking for, my good woman?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>She told him. <quote>What was your brother's regiment?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>She answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/><quote>You are only <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="1000">thousands</num> who want to know to-day where their dead are lying here,</quote> he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/><quote>I hope you will find your brother's grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Don't mourn too much for him. He died a soldier's death.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Then, turning, he called, <quote><rs type="role2">Orderly</rs>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>A soldier came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/><quote>Stay with this woman and help her find her brother's grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Report to me this evening.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>And he went back, remounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>and the company rode on at a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>After a while the orderly found the grave, and she knelt there and prayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Then she asked the soldier: <quote>Who was that gentleman that told you to help me?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/><quote>That?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>said the orderly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/><quote>Why, didn't you know him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>That was <q direct="unspecified">Little Mac.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/></quote> <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>I said,</quote> was the end of her story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Innumerable like prayers of grateful souls of men and women, with those words, <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless him!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/><pb id="p.20" n="20"/></p> 
<p>It is surely unnecessary to say that he was a gentleman in every sense of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>In social life he was perfectly simple in his manner, wholly unaffected, always genial, having rare conversational powers with all classes of persons, devoutly respectful to ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>This deference to the female sex was a marked characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>I note an illustration of it which I find in many of his private letters, some in this volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>When at the head of the army, and occupying a position only <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to the <rs>President</rs>, he received <num value="1000">thousands</num> of visitors who came from mere curiosity, introduced by senators or others, to see the young general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>In mentioning such visits he invariabry says that he <quote>was presented to the ladies</quote> --never uses what would have been a perfectly correct expression under the circumstances: <quote>the ladies were presented to me.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>In person <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00020.00119" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> <measure n="9inches" type="distance">nine inches</measure> tall, with great breadth of shoulders and solid, not superfluous, muscle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>He measured <measure n="45inches" type="distance">forty-five inches</measure> around the chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>His physical strength in his younger life was very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>He seldom exerted it in later years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>He contracted disease in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war which never wholly left him, and which doubtless somewhat impaired his strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>But in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> I have seen him bend <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>-dollar over the end of his thumb by pressure between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> finger of his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>That same evening we were sitting together, <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was a distinguished officer who weighed over <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num>. <quote>They tell me, general,</quote> said I, <quote>that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00020.00120" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,G.,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> can throw you over his head.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/><quote>So they say,</quote> was the somewhat uncertain response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/><quote>Let me alone, general!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>he exclaimed-<quote>let me alone!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>He can do it &mdash; he has done it. He can toss me in his arms like a baby.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>To the very last day of his life his step was quick, firm, elastic, the expression of that uniform cheerfulness, bouyancy, and enjoyment of life which he possessed and which he always communicated to those around him. I think I shall be understood in saying that his physical bearing was such that of all men he was the very last with whom those who knew him could connect any thought of death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>I have left to the last to speak of the controlling feature of McClcl-<persName n="Ian,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00020.00122" reg="mostcommon:Ian,nomatch:0"><surname>Ian</surname></persName>'s character and life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>His religion was deep, earnest, practical; not vague or ill-defined to himself or others, not obtrusive, but outspoken when occasion required, and, when outspoken, frank and hearty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>For it was part and parcel of his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>I must use brief words, and I seek to make them distinct, in defining his creed, which was clear as crystal, more steadfast than the hills &mdash; the faith once delivered to the saints in its pure simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>With his intellectual powers, which were of the highest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>and with his heart, which was supremely gentle, as trustful all his life as any child's, he was servant and follower of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0102.0000.00020.00123" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, in whom he believed as <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>In all his life, public and private, every purpose was formed, every act done in the light of that faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>It was this which not only produced in him that stainless purity of walk and conversation which all who knew him <pb id="p.21" n="21"/>recognized, but also gave him strength for all the great works of a great life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>It was this which created that magnetic power so often spoken of, won to him that marvellous devotion of his soldiers, made all who knew him regard him with affection, those who knew him best love him most.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Out of the private correspondence which has come into my hands I have selected, and venture to make public here, <num value="2">two</num> letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>These, better than anything I can say, will serve to open, for those who only knew him as a public man, a view of that inner life &mdash; his real life &mdash; which he lived among his familiar friends: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>I am sure you are tired of being governor or anything else, for, no matter what the title be, the result is always the same &mdash; work, work unceasingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>I was very glad to see those <quote>leaning-back</quote> characters once more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Some few years ago I saw &mdash; near <placeName><persName n="Alsop,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0000.00021.00128" reg="mostcommon:Alsop,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Alsop</surname></persName>'s office</placeName> &mdash; a ship named for me, probably the same you saw the other day. I fancy <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>, that we will never reach that <quote>land where it is always afternoon</quote> in any ship built by mortal hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Our fate is to work, and still to work, as long as there is any work left in us; and I do not doubt that it is best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>For I can't help thinking that, when me reach that other and far better land, we shall still have work to do throughout the long ages, only we will then see, as we go on, that it is all done for the <rs>Master</rs> and under His own eye; and we will like it, and never grow weary of it, as we often do here when we don't clearly see to what end me are working, and our work brings us in contact with all sorts of men and things not pleasant to rub against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>I suppose that the more we work here the better we shall be trained for that other work, which, after all, is the great end towards which we move, or ought to be moving.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Well, I did not start out to sermonize, but somehow or other your letter started my thoughts in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>I <hi rend="italics">would</hi> like to take the <quote>belongings</quote> and sail for that quiet land; but we will have to wait some little time yet, and I suppose each <num value="1">one</num> will reach it alone, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrived wait for the others.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>In editing this volume for the press I have tried to do that which my friend would approve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>The discretion which he gave me was ample.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>I have exercised it by omissions, not by changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>Of course his work was unfinished when he left it. Living prepared for the call whenever it might come, serving <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as he had served his country, always ready for whatever command he might receive, it is nevertheless certain that, when the order came to go to duty in another life, he was not expecting it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>In writing his memoirs he had made no haste to complete them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Probably had he lived to extreme old age there would still have been much to be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>For years after the civil war he declined to write anything about it. He had no anxieties for himself and his own reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>An abiding faith in time and the calm judgment of his country kept him from any care about the misstatements, misrepresentations, and falsehoods of which he, more perhaps than any American who had lived before him, excepting <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, had been made the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Besides, he always gave less thought to himself and his own reputation than any man I ever knew or heard of. He was a man of very deep feeling, with the passions of all ardent souls; but so absolute had become his habitual self-control and subjection of all passionate resentment, so complete the self-abnegation which characterized him, I can affirm with certainty that he always felt more sorrow for the man who maligned him than for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Once when I showed him a slander, a pure fabrication, which had been published on the authority of <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n0102.0000.00022.00133" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,A.,E.,,:4"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, he read it, laid down the magazine with a quiet laugh, said, <quote>Poor burn!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>He didn't know what he was saying,</quote> and, after a few kindly words about his old friend, dropped the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>In vain was he urged to publish the demonstrations he possessed of the falsehood of this and similar attacks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>His happiness in life consisted in what he was always doing for others, without thought of self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>As he had never sought position, command, or promotion, so he never asked his countrymen to give him honor or thanks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>It was only when I urged on him that his children had a right to possess his own story that he took the subject into consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Afterward, while in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, he began to write out personal reminiscences, which from time to time he continued after his return to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>A fire destroyed all his manuscript.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>In <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct> he resumed the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>He did not labor at it continuously, with intent to produce a book, but wrote as the humor seized him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>His Report, made in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, but held back by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> for some months, had been full, accurate, and exhaustive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>It was published in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>No statement in it has ever been controverted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>This Report did not include any accounts of his personal relations to the civilians who <pb id="p.23" n="23"/>directed the course of political events and misdirected military operations during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war. These accounts he wrote, accompanying them with letters, despatches, documents &mdash; whatever might throw light on history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>He rewrote and extended a large part of the military history &mdash; which his Report had given in brief, and from time to time inserted pages of manuscript here and there in those parts of it which he had not rewritten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Thus as years passed he was extending and annotating a history, at all times complete in itself as a narrative; and, however long he had lived, would probably have enriched it from year to year with more and more of interesting material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>His sudden death interrupted the progress of his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>When I came to examine the collected and arranged papers which he entrusted to me, verbally while living, and by his last will, I found not only the narrative which I have styled <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00023.00134" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s own story, but sufficient illustrative and explanatory documents, letters, and despatches to form several volumes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>He had not written with reference to publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>It was expressly for his children that he was preparing his memoirs, and there was a great deal in them which was intended solely for their eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>A century hence every word, perhaps, might be interesting to those who enjoy personal memoirs, but, as a matter of course, it has been my duty to withhold such portions as I think he would not have published now. I have exercised my discretion in reserving for future publication much of the material he had arranged, which would now be valuable, and doubtless acceptable, but would have extended this volume to a series of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>All the foot-notes in the volume are mine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Another class of material came into my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00023.00135" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had been married only a few months before the outbreak of the war. Not the least sacrifice which he made in entering the service was the breaking up of the home &mdash; his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> home &mdash; in which he had found the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> happiness of a laborious life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Sometimes during his public service <persName n="McClellan,Mrs.,,,," id="n0102.0000.00023.00136" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was able to be with him, especially while he was in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>When they were separated he found his only rest and refreshment in writing to her. To no other person in the world did he open his whole soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The perfection of their love, the absolute confidence which he reposed, and wisely reposed, in her, made his letters not only graphic accounts of daily events, great and small, but an exposure of his inmost feelings I found among his papers some extracts from these letters, which he had made to aid him in writing his memoirs; but the letters were supposed to have vanished in the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>When they were discovered, carefully sealed for the <num value="1">one</num> only person to whom they belonged, I asked for fuller extracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>I confess that I hesitated very much about giving any part of these letters, written in the most sacred confidence of life, to the public eye. Others advised that, as he belonged to his country, and innumerable citizens and soldiers loved him with devout affection, they could well be allowed, had indeed a right, to read portions of these letters which reveal <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00023.00137" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> the man, as his narrative shows <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0000.00023.00138" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> the soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>By far the larger portion of the letters, and of every letter, belongs <pb id="p.24" n="24"/>to that confidence which not even death affects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>When the occurrences at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, aroused the nation to some appreciation of the gravity of the situation, I was engaged in civil life as president of the <rs>Eastern Division</rs> of the <orgName n="Ohio and Mississippi Railroad" type="railroad">Ohio and Mississippi Railroad</orgName>, having resigned my commission as a captain of cavalry in <dateStruct value="1857-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>My residence was then in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, and the fact that I had been in the army threw me in contact with the leading men of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>My old army associations had placed me in intimate relations with many Southern men, and I had travelled much in the <rs>South</rs>, so that I was, perhaps, better prepared to weigh the situation than the majority of Northern men. So strongly was I convinced that war would ensue that when, in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, I leased a house in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> for the term of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, I insisted upon a clause in the lease releasing me from the obligation in the event of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>The general current of events during the winter, and many special instances of outrage or insult offered to unoffending Northern travellers in the <rs>Southwest</rs> (coming to my knowledge as a railway official), reduced this impression to a certainty in my mind, even before the firing upon <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>After all that has been said and written upon the subject, I suppose none now doubt that slavery was the real knot of the question and the underlying cause of the war. It is now easy to perceive how the war might have been avoided if for <num value="2">two</num> or <pb id="p.30" n="30"/><num value="3">three</num> generations back all the men of both sections had been eminently wise, calm, unselfish, and patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>But with men as they are, it would be difficult indeed to indicate how a permanent pacific solution could have been reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>It is no doubt true that events were precipitated, perhaps rendered inevitable, by the violent course of a comparatively small number of men, on both sides of the line, during the <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> preceding the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>But it is the distinct lesson of history that this is always so; that the great crises in the world's history are induced by the words and actions of a few earnest or violent men, who stir up the masses and induce them blindly to follow their lead, whether for good or evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>As a rule the masses of civilized men, if left to themselves, are not prone to disturb the existing order of things or to resort to violent measures, unless suffering under intense evils which come home to each man individually and affect either his personal safety or personal possessions and prosperity; and even in such cases spontaneous uprisings of the masses are rare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>In our own case the people of the <num value="2">two</num> sections did not understand each other before the war, and probably neither section regarded the other as seriously in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The wide difference existing in social organization and habits had much to do with this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>In the <rs>South</rs> the habit of carrying, and using on slight provocation, deadly weapons, the sparse settlement of the country, the idle and reckless habits of the majority of the illiterate whites, the self-assertion natural to the dominant race in a slave-holding country, all conspired to impress them with an ill-founded assumption of superior worth and courage over the industrious, peaceful, law-abiding Northerners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>On the other hand, the men of the <rs>North</rs> had become somewhat habituated to the boastful assertions too common among the <name>Southerners</name>, and had learned to believe that no real purpose of using force lay concealed beneath their violent language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>Both were mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>The <rs>Southerner</rs>, with all his gasconading, was earnest in his intention to fight to the last for slavery and the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>The peaceful <rs>Northerner</rs>, unaccustomed to personal warfare and prone to submit his disputes to the regular ordeal of law, was ready to lay down his life for the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/><pb id="p.31" n="31"/></p> 
<p>More gallant foes never met on the field of battle than these men of the same race, who had so long lived under the ample folds of the same flag; more desperate battles were never fought than those now about to occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The military virtues of patriotism, patience, endurance, self-abnegation, and heroism were about to receive their most striking illustrations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>In judging the motives of men at this great crisis it must be remembered that the vast majority of Southern men had been educated in the doctrine of secession and of extreme State-rights &mdash; which is, that allegiance was due <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the <rs>State</rs>, next to the general government, and that the <rs>State</rs> when it entered the <rs>Union</rs> retained the right to withdraw at will; while in the <rs>North</rs> the doctrine was generally held that allegiance to the general government was paramount and the <rs>Union</rs> indissoluble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The masses on each side were honest in their belief as to the justice of their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Their honesty and sincerity were proved by the sacrifices they made, by the earnestness with which so many devout Christians on both sides confidently relied upon the aid of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in their hour of trial, and by the readiness with which so many brave men laid down their lives on the field of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>When the generation which took part in this contest shall have passed away, and the question can be regarded in the cold light of dispassionate historical and philosophical inquiry, it will be clearly seen that in this case also history has repeated itself, and that the truth lay midway between the extreme positions assumed by the controlling spirits at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>The right of secession would virtually have carried us back to the old Confederacy, which proved so weak from lack of cohesion between its parts and of the necessary force in the executive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>The tendency of Northern Republicans was towards a centralized power, under which the autocracy of the <name>States</name> would disappear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>It is impossible for any government to recognize the right of secession unless its assertion is supported by such overwhelming force as to render opposition entirely hopeless, and thus practically convert rebellion into successful revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>There can be no stability, no protection of person and property, no good government, no power to put down disorder at home or to resist oppression from without, under any other principle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>On the other hand, in a country so vast as ours, with such <pb id="p.32" n="32"/>great differences of topography and of climate, with a population so numerous and derived from such a variety of sources, and, in consequence of all this, such diversities of habits, local laws, and material interests, it is impossible for a centralized government to legislate satisfactorily for all the domestic concerns of the various parts of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>The only safe policy is that the general government be strictly confined to the general powers and duties vested in it by the old Constitution, while the individual States preserve all the sovereign rights and powers retained by them when the constitutional compact was formed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>As a corollary from this I am convinced that no State can be deprived of any of these retained rights, powers, and duties without its own consent; and that the power of amending the <rs>Constitution</rs> was intended to apply only to amendments affecting the manner of carrying into effect the original provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but not to enable the general government to seize new power at the expense of any unwilling State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>A strict adherence in practice to this theory presents, in my opinion, the only possibility of the permanent maintenance of our Union throughout the long years of the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The old Southern doctrine of extreme State-rights, including that of secession, would reduce the <rs>Union</rs> to a mere rope of sand, and would completely paralyze the general government, rendering it an object of just contempt at home and abroad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>The doctrine of centralization, if carried to its legitimate conclusions, in substituting the legislation of the general government for that of the <name>States</name> in regard to the local and domestic affairs of the people, would soon cause so much discontent and suffering as to result in a resort to secession as the only practical remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>And in this case the <rs>Union</rs> could only be maintained by the superior force of a strong military central government, thus rendering the <rs>Union</rs> valueless for its great object of securing the liberties of the people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>In the course of my narrative the fact will appear &mdash; a fact well known to all who intelligently followed the events of the time-that, at the beginning of the great civil war, the general government was powerless, both in the <name>East</name> and <name>West</name>, to maintain its rights and vindicate its authority, and that the means to accomplish these vital ends were furnished by the individual States, <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>acting in their capacity as sovereigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>The history of that period is the best possible vindication of the <rs>Northern</rs> doctrine of State-rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>And no impartial observer of the events of the war can fail to see that all the subsequent violations of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and of the rights of the loyal States, by the general government, were not only wholly unnecessary but positively pernicious at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The safety of the republic at no time during the war required or justified any departure from the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>That great instrument was broad enough to cover even the necessities of that most eventful period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>The loyalty of the great masses of the <rs>Northern</rs> people was so marked and so strong that they could be trusted far more than most of the selfish servants whom a minority had placed in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>The happiest condition of affairs for us would no doubt be found in a return to the situation before the war, when the action of the general government, being strictly confined to its legitimate purposes, was so little felt by individual citizens that they almost forgot its existence, and were almost unaware that there was any other government in the land than those of the <name>States</name> and municipalities,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Soon after my arrival in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> I had several interviews with prominent abolitionists &mdash; of whom <persName n="Sumner,Senator,,,," id="n0102.0001.00033.00143" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Edwin,V.,,:3"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num>--on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>I invariably took the ground that I was thoroughly opposed to slavery, regarding it as a great evil, especially to the whites of the <rs>South</rs>, but that in my opinion no sweeping measure of emancipation should be carried out, unless accompanied by arrangements providing for the new relations between employers and employed, carefully guarding the rights and interests of both; and that were such a measure framed to my satisfaction I would cordially support it. <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00033.00144" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Edwin,V.,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> replied &mdash; others also agreed with him &mdash; that such points did not concern us, and that all that must be left to take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>My reply was that no real statesman could ever contemplate so sweeping and serious a measure as sudden and general emancipation without looking to the future and providing for its consequences; that <num value="4.5">four and a half</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of uneducated slaves should not suddenly be manumitted without due precautions taken both to protect them and to guard against them; that just there was the point where we differed radically and probably irreconcilably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/><pb id="p.34" n="34"/></p> 
<p>My own view was that emancipation should be accomplished gradually, and that the negroes should be fitted for it by certain preparatory steps in the way of education, recognition of the rights of family and marriage, prohibition against selling them without their own consent, the freedom of those born after a certain date, etc. I was always prepared to make it <num value="1">one</num> of the essential conditions of peace that slavery should be abolished within a fixed and reasonable period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Had the arrangements of the terms of peace been in my hands I should certainly have insisted on this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>During the autumn of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, after arriving in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, I discontinued the practice of returning fugitive slaves to their owners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>In <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, after <persName n="Pegram,,,,," id="n0102.0001.00034.00145" reg="mostcommon:Pegram,John,,,:2"><surname>Pegram</surname></persName>'s surrender, when I had been directed to parole the prisoners, I collected the large number of negro slaves captured with their masters, and gave them their choice as <hi rend="italics">to</hi> returning with the latter, remaining in camp under pay as laborers, or going North.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>With <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions they decided to return with their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>From that time forward I never returned a negro slave to his master, although many such requisitions were made on me. I followed the principle that there could be no slave in my camp.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>On the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> I not only received all negroes who came to the camps, but (especially when on the <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.175 000000.3506	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.175 000000.3506	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName>) frequently sent out parties to bring in negroes, because I required them for certain work around the camps and depots too severe for white men in that climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>They were employed upon police work, loading and unloading transports, etc., and sometimes upon entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>They were fed and received some small wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>As a rule much strictness was necessary to make them work; they supposed that in leaving their masters they left all labor behind them, and that they would be clothed, fed, and allowed to live in idleness in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>That was their only idea of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>It was very clear that they were entirely unfit for sudden emancipation and the reception of the electoral franchise, and should have been gradually prepared for it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>While on this subject I must say that, although I was a strong Democrat of the <name>Stephen</name> A. <placeName reg="Douglas school">Douglas school</placeName>, I had no personal political ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>I knew nothing about <quote>practical politics,</quote> had never even voted except for <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0102.0001.00034.00146" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, and during the whole <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>period of my command I never did or wrote anything, or abstained from doing or writing anything, in view of its political effect upon myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>My ambition was fully gratified by the possession of the command of the army, and, so long as I held that, nothing would have induced me to give it up for the <name>Presidency</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>Whenever I wrote anything of a political nature it was only with the hope of doing something towards the maintenance of those political principles which I honestly thought should control the conduct of the war. In fact, I sacrificed my own interests rather than acquiesce in what I thought wrong or impolitic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> and his advisers made a great mistake in supposing that I desired political advancement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Many of the <rs>Democratic</rs> leaders did me great harm by using my name for party purposes without my knowledge or consent; and, without intending it, probably did more than my armed enemies in the way of ruining my military career by giving the administration some reason to suppose that in the event of military success I might prove a dangerous political rival.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Regarding, as I did, the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> and preservation of the national life to be the great object of the war, I would, no doubt, have acquiesced in any honorable measure absolutely necessary to bring about the desired result, even to the forcible and general abolition of slavery, if found to be a military necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>I recognized the fact that as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had chosen to resort to the arbitrament of arms, they must abide by the logical consequences of the stern laws of war. But, as I always believed that we should fight to bring them back into the <rs>Union</rs>, and should treat them as members of the <rs>Union</rs> when so brought back, I held that it was a matter of sound policy to do nothing likely to render ultimate reconciliation and harmony impossible, unless such a course were imperative to secure military success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Nor do I now believe that my ideas were quixotic or impracticable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Since the war I have met many of my late antagonists, and have found none who entertained any personal enmity against me. While acknowledging, with <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0102.0001.00035.00147" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,:3"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and other of their generals, that they feared me more than any of the <rs>Northern</rs> generals, and that I had struck them harder blows when in the full prime of their strength, they have all said that I fought them like a gentleman <pb id="p.36" n="36"/>and in an honorable way, and that they felt nothing but respect for me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>I remember very well, when riding over the field of <placeName reg="South Mountain, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681169">South Mountain</placeName>, that, passing by a severely wounded <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName>, I dismounted and spoke with him, asking whether I could do anything to relieve him. He was a lieutenant-colonel of a <orgName type="mil" key="SCRegiment">South Carolina regiment</orgName>, and asked me if I was <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00148" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>; and when I said that I was <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00149" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, he grasped my hand and told me that he was perfectly willing to be wounded and a prisoner for the sake of taking by the hand <num value="1">one</num> whom all the <rs>Confederates</rs> so honored and admired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>Such things happened to me not unfrequently, and I confess that it gave me no little pleasure to find that my antagonists shared the feelings of my own men for me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>To revert to politics for a moment: Then residing in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> I knew <persName n="Douglas,Mister,Stephen,A.,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00150" reg="default:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Stephen</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> quite well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>During his campaign for the senatorship against <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00151" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:25"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> they were on <num value="1">one</num> occasion to hold a joint discussion at <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName>, and, as my business called me in that direction, I invited <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00152" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> to accompany me in my private car. We started late in the evening, and <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00153" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> brought with him a number of his political henchmen, with whom he was up all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>We reached <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName> early in the afternoon of the nest day, and about half an hour before arriving I warned <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00154" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, who had continued his amusements up to that time, not having slept at all. I dreaded a failure in the discussion about to take place, for the Little Giant certainly had had no opportunity of thinking of the subject of the debate, and did not seem to be in fit condition to carry it on. Not that he was intoxicated, but looking unkempt and sleepy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>He, however, retired to my private cabin, and soon emerged perfectly fresh and ready for the work before him; so much so that I thought his speech of that day his best during the campaign.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00155" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:25"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> entertained a very high respect for <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00156" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s powers, and no doubt had the latter survived he would have exercised a great and most favorable influence upon <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00036.00157" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:25"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, as well as upon the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>His death was a severe blow to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>He would, in all probability, have been able to control the more flighty leaders of the <rs>Northwestern Democracy</rs>, and have kept the party in the eyes of <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>the world, as its masses really were, united in a hearty support of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>While giving due weight to all said or done by the ultra abolitionists of the <rs>North</rs>, I hold the <rs>South</rs> directly accountable for the war. If the election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00037.00158" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:25"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> meant a more determined attack upon slavery, they of the <rs>South</rs> were responsible for the result, in consequence of their desertion of <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0001.00037.00159" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and the resulting rupture of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Even after that, if they had chosen to draw near the <rs>Northern Democrats</rs> again, seeking their remedy and protection within the <rs>Union</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the laws, they would have retained the right on their side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>If left to their own cool judgment it is probable that the majority of the <rs>Southern</rs> whites would have realized that slavery could not exist much longer, and that their wisest course was to recognize that fact, consent that it should not be extended beyond its existing limits, and provide for its gradual extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>But, for various reasons, more reckless counsels prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The Southern States rallied to the support of their peculiar institution, declared it to be a holy ordinance, demanded that it might be extended over the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and bitterly opposed the idea that general manumission should be provided for in any form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Thus a state of feeling arose, more particularly in the <rs>South</rs>, which could only be quieted by the drastic methods of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>In the early part of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, as has already been stated, it became almost impossible for any Northern man to travel in the <rs>Southwest</rs> without being subjected to gross insults or to personal maltreated; this conduct soon produced a counter irritation, and, as for myself, I confess that ere long I came to the conclusion that there was but <num value="1">one</num> way to put an end to such proceedings, and that the sooner we entered upon that way the better it would be. When <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> was fired upon there was no longer room for discussion, and the question was narrowed to the issue of the life of the <rs>Union</rs> and the honor of the flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>For men who thought as I did there was but <num value="1">one</num> course open.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>It was clear that, even if a peaceable separation were arranged, we would soon come to blows on some secondary issue, such as boundaries, the division of public property, the slavery question on the borders, the free navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, the territorial domain, etc., etc., and in that view it was better <pb id="p.38" n="38"/>to throw everything else to <num value="1">one</num> side and fight upon the main underlying issue &mdash; the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> and the observance of the laws of the general government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>It is perhaps hardly worth while to notice here any of those unfounded slanders which some papers uttered concerning me &mdash; that is, the statement that at the outbreak of the war I entertained offers to enter the <rs>Southern</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>I need only say that there was not the shadow of a foundation for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>The leading men on the <rs>Southern</rs> side knew perfectly well that of all men I would be the last to waver in my allegiance to the general government and its flag.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>At no period, either before or after the war broke out, did any <num value="1">one</num> suggest to me, either directly or indirectly, the idea of my taking part with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>No <num value="1">one</num> ever made me any offer to join the rebel service; no <num value="1">one</num> ever suggested the possibility of my dreaming of espousing that side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>I never, in any manner, intimated to any <num value="1">one</num> that it would be possible for me to take any other side than that of the general government and the <rs>Union</rs>, nor did such a thought ever pass through my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>I always stated distinctly that, should the apprehended crisis arrive, I should stand by the <rs>Union</rs> and the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>I make this record because there have been people so foolish as to believe the statements made by radical newspapers to the effect that I had offered my services to the secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Those papers must have known their statements to be entirely false and void of foundation, when they made them for the sole purpose of serving party political ends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The secession of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1860-12-20"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg="20">20</day>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, was closely followed by that of <num value="6">six</num> other States, and on the <dateStruct value="1861-02-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="02">Feb.</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> was formally proclaimed and its president elected.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>How soon the work of organizing and instructing troops began <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>in the <rs>South</rs> will appear from the fact that as early as the <dateStruct value="1861-01-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="01">Jan.</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> an expedition for the relief of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was turned back by the fire of the <rs>Southern</rs> batteries near the entrance of <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>About the same time the navy-yard at <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> was occupied by an armed force under <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0102.0001.00039.00161" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,B.,,,:1"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, and the works at the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName> garrisoned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>In brief, at least from the beginning of <dateStruct value="1861-01-"><month reg="01">Jan.</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and probably in many cases yet earlier, the work of organizing, arming, and instructing troops began throughout the seceded States, and not improbably in such of the slaveholding States also as had not yet formally joined the movement of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>As early as <dateStruct value="-02-18"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg="18">18</day></dateStruct>, <persName n="Twiggs,General,,,," id="n0102.0001.00039.00162" reg="mostcommon:Twiggs,Gen,D.,E.,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Twiggs</surname></persName> surrendered the forces under his command in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>Meanwhile neither the general government nor the <rs>Northern States</rs> were doing anything to counteract this movement and meet the impending storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Not only were there no additional troops raised, no steps taken to organize and arm the militia and volunteers, but, so far as the general government was concerned, the authorities seemed to dread even the semblance of a movement to reinforce the few forts still in their possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>The little regular army, scattered over the vast area of the <rs>West</rs>, was left without orders, and not even concentrated for self-defence, much less brought in where its services might be available against the active forces of the secessionists, as common prudence would have suggested, as early as the passage of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> ordinance of secession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Such was the condition of affairs when <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> surrendered on the <dateStruct value="1861-04-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The general government and the <rs>Northern States</rs> were utterly unprepared for war; not a man enlisted, not a musket procured, not a cartridge made, not a piece of clothing or equipment provided, beyond those maintained during a state of profound and apparently permanent peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>The Southern States for nearly <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> had been actively preparing for the eventuality they intended to force on, and had made no little headway in the collection of material, the organization and instruction of troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Moreover, on the breaking-out of hostilities they possessed another and very considerable advantage over the <name>Northerners</name>: that is to say, <num value="1">one</num> of the results of the peculiar institution of the <rs>South</rs> was that the class of slaveholders, the highly educated <pb id="p.40" n="40"/>whites, had always composed an aristocracy, which furnished the social and political leaders to whom the poor whites were, as a rule, accustomed to defer, so that when the time arrived to raise troops the aristocratic class furnished officers always accustomed to control, and the poor whites furnished the mass of the private soldiers, always habituated to that deference to their leaders which under the new circumstances rapidly passed into obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Discipline was thus very easily established among them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Among the <rs>Northern</rs> men there was little difficulty in establishing discipline when the officers were intelligent gentlemen; but, in the early part of the war particularly, it occurred that the officers were sometimes inferior in intelligence and education to the soldiers, and in these cases the establishment of discipline presented far greater difficulties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Here let me say that, given good officers, there are no men in the world who admit of a more thorough and effective discipline than the native-born <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0102.0001.00040.00163" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Their intelligence soon shows them the absolute necessity of discipline in an army, and its advantages to all concerned; but the kind of discipline best adapted to them differs materially from that required by other races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Their fighting qualities are <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to none in the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>When the catastrophe occurred &mdash; the firing upon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>--the excitement in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> and along the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName> was naturally intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>The formation of regiments began at once, and all who had military knowledge or experience were eagerly sought for, myself among others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>I did what I could in the way of giving advice to those who sought it, and in allaying the excitement in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>About this time I received telegrams from friends in New York informing me that the governor of that State desired to avail himself of my services; another from <persName n="Patterson,General,Robert,,," id="n0102.0001.00040.00164" reg="default:Patterson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName>, offering me the position of chief-engineer of the command of militia then organizing under his orders; and <num value="1">one</num> from <persName n="Curtin,Governor,,,," id="n0102.0001.00040.00165" reg="mostcommon:Curtin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Curtin</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, offering me the command of the <orgName type="mil" key="PAReserves">Pennsylvania Reserves</orgName>, afterwards given to <persName n="McCall,,,,," id="n0102.0001.00040.00166" reg="mostcommon:McCall,George,A.,,:3"><surname>McCall</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>I promptly arranged my business affairs so as to admit of a short absence, and started for <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> to see what was best to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>At the request of several gentlemen of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> I stopped at <placeName reg="Columbus, Franklin, Ohio" key="tgn,7013645">Columbus</placeName> to give <persName n="Dennison,Governor,,,," id="n0102.0001.00040.00167" reg="mostcommon:Dennison,W.,,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Dennison</surname></persName> some <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>information about the conditions of affairs in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, intending to remain only a few hours and then proceed to <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>At the time of my appointment in <placeName key="tgn,7007706" n="1.000 5" reg="ohio">Ohio</placeName> we were cut off from direct communication with <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> in consequence of the unfortunate occurrences in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and the attention of the national authorities was confined exclusively to the task of relieving the capital from danger and of securing its communications with the loyal States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>We in the <rs>West</rs> were therefore left for a long time without orders, advice, money, or supplies of any kind, and it was clear that the different States must take care of themselves and provide their own means of defence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>At this critical juncture the value and vitality of the <rs>State</rs> governments was fully tested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>Fortunately they proved equal to the emergency and saved the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> who coolly and dispassionately reviews the occurrences of that exciting period must arrive at the conclusion that, in a country so large as ours, the safety of the nation imperatively demands the entire preservation of the rights and autonomy of the several States as secured by the original Constitution; of course with the proviso that the vexed question of the right of secession has been for ever settled in the negative by the result of the civil war. The Eastern States were to a certain extent provided with arms, the material of war, and some tolerably organized and instructed militia regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Their prompt action saved the capital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The Western States were almost entirely without the means of defence, but the governors (cordially supported by the legislatures) at once took steps to obtain by purchase and by contract, at home and abroad, the requisite arms, ammunition, clothing, camp equipage, etc. The supplies thus provided were often inferior in quality and insufficient in quantity, but they answered the purpose until better arrangements could be made.

<p>In addition to the <orgName n="Ohio volunteers" type="volunteers">Ohio volunteers</orgName> called for by the general government, the governor placed under my command <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="13">thirteen</num> regiments of State troops; and for several weeks I remained at <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, without a staff, working night and day at the organization of the entire <placeName key="tgn,7007706" n="1.000 5" reg="ohio">Ohio</placeName> contingent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>The condition of affairs in the <rs>West</rs> was not satisfactory or reassuring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>We were entirely unprepared for war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The secessionists were gathering forces in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and upon the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, as well as in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and many well-informed persons felt great anxiety in respect to the loyalty of large numbers of the inhabitants of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Illinois</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>In brief, our situation was difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>We were surrounded by possible, or even probable, dangers; were without organization, arms, supplies, money, officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>We had no idea of the policy which the general government intended to pursue; we had no <quote>head</quote> to direct affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>It fell to me, perhaps more than to any <num value="1">one</num> person, to supply these pressing wants, and at this distance I may say that the task was not unsatisfactorily performed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>My civil career ended at this time, for from the evening when I received the appointment as major-general of the <orgName type="mil" key="OHVolunteer">Ohio Volunteers</orgName> all my thoughts and efforts were directed to my military duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The owners of the road refused to accept my resignation for many months, until it was certain that I was inextricably involved in military affairs; but I drew no pay from them after I ceased to do the duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The salary I gave up to re-enter the military service was <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">ten thousand dollars</measure> per annum.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Before the necessity arose for action in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName> my views were turned towards <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>; for from the beginning I saw the great importance of aiding the loyal men in the mountainous portion of that State, of holding the railways there, and of occupying in force the great projecting bastion formed by that district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>I was satisfied that a firm hold there in force, and with secure communications to the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName>, would soon render the occupation of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName> impossible to the secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>Unhappily the state of affairs brought about by the <rs n="First Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">first Bull Run</rs> rendered it impossible to act upon this theory when the direction of military movements came into my hands, nor did any of my subordinates in the <rs>West</rs> seize the importance of the idea, frequently as I presented it to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>I think that subsequent events proved that the occupation of the central mountain region at an early period of the war would have produced more rapid and decisive results than any movement down the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The defeated <orgName>army of <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0102.0004.00068.00340" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName></orgName> could not property be called an army &mdash; it was only a collection of undisciplined, ill-officered, and uninstructed men, who were, as a rule, much demoralized by defeat and ready to run at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>Positions from which the city could be commanded by the enemy's guns were open for their occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>The troops were as insufficient in number as in quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>The period of service of many regiments had expired, or would do so in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>There was so little discipline that officers and men left their camps at their own will, and, as I have already stated, the city was full of drunken men in uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>The executive was demoralized; an attack by the enemy was expected from hour to hour; material of war did not exist in anything like sufficient quantities; and, lastly, I was not supreme and unhampered, but often thwarted by the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">lieutenant-general</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>I may be permitted to say that my arrival was hailed with delight by all, except, perhaps, the <num value="2">two</num> generals whom I superseded; <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>and that the executive and the country soon passed from a state of abject despair to confidence, as will appear from the newspapers of the time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most pressing demand upon me was the immediate safety of the capital and the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>This was provided for by at once exacting the most rigid discipline and order; by arresting all ignorant officers and men, and sending them back to their regiments; by instituting and enforcing strict rules in regard to permission for leaving the camps; by prohibiting civilians and others not on duty from crossing the river or visiting the camps without permits from headquarters; by organizing permanent brigades under regular officers, and by placing the troops in good defensive positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>I threw them further out from the city, so as to have space in rear for manoeuvring, and selected positions which commanded the various avenues of approach to the city and enabled the different brigades to afford reciprocal support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>I lost no time in acquiring an accurate knowledge of the ground in all directions, and by frequent visits to the troops made them personally acquainted with me, while I learned all about them, their condition and their needs, and thus soon succeeded in inspiring full confidence and a good <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> in place of the lamentable state of affairs which existed on my arrival.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Thus I passed long days in the saddle and my nights in the office &mdash; a very fatiguing life, but <num value="1">one</num> which made my power felt everywhere and by every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>There were about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> regular infantry with <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0102.0004.00069.00341" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Arlington, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7015769">Arlington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>These, with a regular battery and a squadron of regular cavalry, I at once brought to the city and employed as a <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost-guard</orgName>, with the most satisfactory results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>It was through their discipline, steadiness, and devotion that order was so promptly established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>The effect of all this was that on the <dateStruct value="-08-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> I was able to write to <num value="1">one</num> of my family: <quote>I have <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> perfectly quiet now; you would not know that there was a regiment here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>I have restored order very completely already.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>In re-arranging the posts and organization of the troops I brought over to the <rs>Washington</rs> side of the river those regiments which had been most shaken and demoralized by the defeat of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and retained them there, with the newly arriving regiments, until in fit condition to be trusted on the side towards the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>My report (made in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>) gives in sufficient detail the measures taken to expedite the instruction, discipline, and equipment of the new regiments on the <rs>Washington</rs> side before assigning them to brigades in front of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>I also proceeded at once to reorganize the various staff departments on a footing commensurate with the actual and future condition of affairs, and used every effort to hasten the arrival of new regiments, as well as the manufacture and purchase of war material of all kinds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Fortunately I had some excellent officers at my disposal and at once made use of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>At this period I committed <num value="1">one</num> of my greatest errors &mdash; that was in retaining <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0102.0004.00070.00346" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName> on duty with the troops under my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>I knew that he had been a close student of military affairs, and thought that he possessed sufficient ability to be useful in a subordinate capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>Moreover, I pitied him extremely, <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>and thought that circumstances had as much to do with his failure at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> as any want of ability and energy on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>I knew that if I sent him away he would be ruined for life, and desired to give him an opportunity to retrieve his military reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>I therefore left him in the nominal command on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side of the river until the order forming the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was issued; he doing some little bureau work and retaining a large staff, while I performed the real military labor demanded by the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>I was sadly deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>He never appreciated my motives, and felt no gratitude for my forbearance and kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>Subsequent events proved that, although in some respects a very good bureau officer and a fair disciplinarian and drill-officer for a school of instruction, he lacked the qualities necessary for a commander in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>After <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0102.0004.00071.00347" reg="mostcommon:Pope,John,,,:2"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s campaign it was not safe for <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0102.0004.00071.00348" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> to visit the camps of his troops; the men declared that they would kill him. I have long been convinced that he intrigued against me to the utmost of his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>His conduct towards <persName n="Porter,,Fitz-John,,," id="n0102.0004.00071.00349" reg="default:Porter,Fitz-John,,,"><foreName>Fitz-John</foreName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> on the <rs n="Second Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">second Bull Run</rs> campaign, his testimony in the latter's trial, and subsequent rehearing in <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, show what manner of man he was. In all human probability I should have been spared an infinite amount of trouble had I relieved him upon reaching <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>: and allowed him to sink at once into obscurity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>When I resumed command it was clear that a prompt advance was wholly impracticable; for, as I have already stated, the mass of the troops placed under me were utterly demoralized and destitute of organization, instruction, discipline, artillery, cavalry, transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>I repeat that it was not worthy to be called an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>The request to bring with me, or cause to follow, a few of the victorious regiments from <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName> was denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>As it was, nothing remained but to create an army and material as rapidly as possible from the very foundation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>The result of the <rs n="First Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">first Bull Run</rs> had changed the conditions of the problem and complicated them exceedingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>In <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName> I had raw troops against raw troops; my opponents had all the advantages of knowledge of the ground, strong positions, and a country peculiarly adapted to the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>Yet I did not hesitate to attack, and gained complete success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>I felt that against troops who had never been under fire and were not particularly well commanded the offensive offered great advantages, <pb id="p.72" n="72"/>and also felt entire confidence in my ability to handle my men, many of whom had attained a certain rough kind of discipline at <placeName reg="Camp Dennison, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2078714">Camp Dennison</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>But at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> everything was different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>The enemy not only had all the advantages of position, of entrenchments, of the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> resulting from success, but his discipline and drill were far better than our own. It would have been madness to renew the attempt until a complete change was made, for all the advantages of a sudden movement had been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>The problem now was to attack victorious and finely drilled troops in entrenchment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>I knew that this could be done only by well-organized and well-drilled troops, well supplied with artillery and other arms of service; the future of the war proved the correctness of this view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>I had, therefore, no choice but to create a real army and its material out of nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>The contest had already assumed such a phase that large masses were necessary to decide it. To use such masses they must be organized and instructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>Perhaps even then a few <num value="1000">thousand</num> regulars would have decided the war. But we had them not!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>Let those who criticise me for the delay in creating an army and its material point out an instance when so much has been done with the same means in so short a time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>Not only was it necessary to organize, discipline, and drill the troops, but the immense labor of constructing the fortifications required to secure the city in the absence of the army was also to be performed by the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>Not only did this consume much time and greatly retard the preparation of the army for the field, but it tied down the troops to the line of the defences, and rendered it impossible to take up a more advanced position until the works were finished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>Before my arrival no <num value="1">one</num> had contemplated the complete fortification of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>I at once conceived the idea and carried it into effect; for I saw immediately that the safety of the capital would always be a great clog on the movements of the army, unless its security were amply guaranteed by strong entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>I cannot speak in too high terms of the cheerfulness, zeal, and activity with which these raw troops performed this arduous and disagreeable labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>They gave thus early an earnest of what might be expected from them under more trying circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>The system adopted was that of detached earthworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>The <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>most important points were occupied by large bastioned forts closed at the gorge, with magazines, platforms, etc.; the scarps and counterscarps often reveted with timber, the parapets usually sodded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>The intermediate points were occupied by lunettes, redoubts, batteries, etc., and in a few cases these were united by infantry parapets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>The entire circumference of the city was thus protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Towards <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> the very important advanced points of <persName n="Upton,,,,," id="n0102.0004.00073.00350" reg="mostcommon:Upton,nomatch:0"><surname>Upton</surname></persName>'s and <placeName reg="Munson's Hills">Munson's Hills</placeName> were held by strong works, with some small batteries near by. This was the key to the approach in that direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>In weighing the magnitude of the task of organizing the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> it must be borne in mind that the deficiency of instructed officers was almost as great as that of well-instructed non-commissioned officers and soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>It is important to emphasize the condition of affairs at this juncture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>If the enemy advanced in fair condition and reasonable force direct upon <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, there were no means of preventing his occupation of <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Weber, Utah" key="tgn,2137140">Arlington Heights</placeName> and the bombardment of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>If he availed himself of the low water in the <rs>Potomac</rs> and crossed at or above the <rs type="place">Great Falls</rs>, at the same time making a feint on the direct approaches, he could enter the city unopposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>For when I arrived there were neither entrenchments nor troops in position on the <rs>Maryland</rs> side, and <orgName n="command"><persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0102.0004.00073.00351" reg="mostcommon:Banks,N.,P.,,:3"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, near <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, was so distant, so unorganized, demoralized, and unfit to march or fight, that it could exercise no influence on the result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>Soon after my arrival I called upon <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0102.0004.00073.00352" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, then in command of all the troops on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side, for a report as to the condition of his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> he reported as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>In the absence of any precise information I should say that but few regiments, if any, are in such condition at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>Those who were in the last movement are not yet recovered, and the others are raw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>Moral and political considerations alike rendered it necessary to retain the seat of government in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, although its situation was the most unfavorable that could be conceived under the circumstances of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>So far as military operations were concerned, it would have been well could the capital have been removed to New York; but this was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>The defence of the capital, containing, as it did, the executive and legislative, the archives of the government, the public buildings, the honor and prestige of the nation, and, as time moved on, vast amounts of military supplies, was a matter of vital importance, and it was necessary to protect it not only from capture, but also against insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>In the early part of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, when we were so entirely open to attack, these reports gave me no little uneasiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>And even after we had reached a point of comparative security, so far as the safety of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was concerned, the probable effects of an inroad in any form into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> rendered it necessary to be constantly on the alert and take every precaution to prevent a crossing of the river.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>I shall refer elsewhere to the inconveniences resulting from the position of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and the nature of the frontier formed by the <rs>Potomac</rs>; in this place it will suffice to say that as the <rs>Potomac</rs> is often fordable, and many of the inhabitants on the <pb id="p.97" n="97"/><placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> side were favorable to the enemy, it was a very necessary and difficult task to guard it properly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>In view of its exposed position and immense political importance it was impossible to allow <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> to be endangered; so that a garrison was always necessary, and all that could be done was to make the fortifications so strong that a comparatively small garrison would suffice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>After the experience of the <rs n="First Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">first Bull Run</rs> the executive would never consent to leave <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> without a large garrison.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>At this juncture it would have been wise to adopt a definite policy with regard to the regular army &mdash; viz., either virtually break it up, as a temporary measure, and distribute its members among the staff and regiments of the volunteer organization, thus giving the volunteers all possible benefit from the discipline and instruction of the regulars, or to fill the regular regiments to their full capacity and employ them as a reserve at critical junctures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>I could not secure the adoption of either plan, and a middle course was followed which resulted less favorably than either of the plans indicated; but it must be said that, even as things were, the regulars were in every way of immense benefit to the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>As a general rule the officers (and, of course, the non-commissioned officers) of the volunteer regiments were entirely ignorant of their duties, and many were unfitted, from their education, moral character, or mental deficiences, for ever acquiring the requisite efficiency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>These latter were weeded out by courts-martial and boards of examination, while the others were instructed <hi rend="italics">pari passu</hi> as they instructed their men. The small number of regular officers available rendered it impossible to furnish all the staff officers from among them; so that a regiment was very fortunate if its colonel was a regular officer, and a brigade was lucky to have a regular as its commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>The generals were usually, and colonels always, obliged to appoint their staff officers from civil life, and instruct them as best they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>It speaks wonders for the intelligence and military aptitude of our people that so much was well done in this way on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>Many of these raw civilians, who were men of pride, intelligence, and education, soon became excellent officers; though these very men most keenly regretted their lack of a good military education in early life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>The frequent reviews I held at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> were not at all for <pb id="p.98" n="98"/>the benefit of the public, nor yet for the purpose of examining the individual condition of the men, although I did much of that even on these occasions &mdash; for a general with a quick eye can see things when riding at a gallop which would seem impossible to a civilian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>But they were to accustom the regiments to move together and see each other, to give the troops an idea of their own strength, to infuse <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi> and mutual emulation, and to acquaint myself with the capacity of the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>These reviews also had a good effect in accustoming the troops to see me, although they saw so much of me in their camps and on the picket-lines that this was of minor importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>With new troops frequent reviews are of the greatest utility and produce the most excellent effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>Those I held did much towards making the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> what it became.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>Some persons, who ought to have known better, have supposed that in organizing the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> I set too high a model before me and consumed unnecessary time in striving to form an army of regulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>This was an unjustifiable error on their part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>I should, of course, have been glad to bring that army to the condition of regulars, but no <num value="1">one</num> knew better than myself that, with the means at my command, that would have been impossible within any reasonable or permissible time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>What I strove for and accomplished was to bring about such a condition of discipline and instruction that the army could be handled on the march and on the field of battle, and that orders could be reasonably well carried out. No <num value="1">one</num> cognizant of the circumstances and possessed of any knowledge of military affairs can honestly believe that I bestowed unnecessary time and labor upon the organization and instruction of that army whose courage, discipline, and efficiency finally brought the war to a close.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>In spite of all the clamor to the contrary, the time spent in the camps of instruction in front of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was well bestowed, and produced the most important and valuable results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>Not a day of it was wasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>The fortifications then erected, both directly and indirectly, saved the capital more than once in the course of the war, and enabled the army to manoeuvre freely and independently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>The organization and discipline then acquired, and so much improved during the campaign of the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> which converted the men into veterans, enabled the army to pass gloriously through the many sanguinary conflicts and harassing <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>campaigns that proved necessary to terminate the war.

<head>Memorandum.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>The object of the present war differs from those in which nations are usually engaged, mainly in this: that the purpose of ordinary war is to conquer a peace and make a treaty on advantageous terms; in this contest it has become necessary to crush a population sufficiently numerous, intelligent, and warlike to constitute a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>We have not only to defeat their armed and organized forces in the field, but to display such an overwhelming strength as will convince all our antagonists, especially those of the governing, aristocratic class, of the utter impossibility of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>Our late reverses make this course imperative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>Had we been successful in the recent battle (Mansssas) it is possible that we might have been spared the labor and expense of a great effort; now me have no alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>Their success will enable the political leaders of the rebels to convince the mass of their people that we are inferior to them in force and courage, and to command ail their resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>The contest began with a class, now it is with a people; our military success can alone restore the former issue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>By thoroughly defeating their armies, taking their strong places, and pursuing a rigidly protective policy as to private property and unarmed persons, and a lenient course as to private soldiers, we may well hope for a permanent restoration of a peaceful Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>But in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance the authority of the government must be supported by overwhelming physical force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>Our foreign relations and financial credit also imperatively demand that the military action of the government should be prompt and irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/><pb id="p.102" n="102"/></p> 
<p>The rebels have chosen <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> as their battle-field, and it seems proper for us to make the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great struggle there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>But while thus directing our main efforts, it is necessary to diminish the resistance there offered us by movements on other points both by land and water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>Without entering at present into details, I would advise that a strong movement be made on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, and that the rebels be driven out of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>As soon as it becomes perfectly clear that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is cordially united with us, I would advise a movement through that State into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> for the purpose of assisting the <rs>Union</rs> men of that region and of seizing the railroads leading from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> to the <rs>East</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>The possession of those roads by us, in connection with the movement on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, would go far towards determining the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> by the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>In the meantime all the passes into <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> from the <rs>East</rs> should be securely guarded, but I would advise no movement from that quarter towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, unless the political condition of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> renders it impossible or inexpedient for us to make the movement upon <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> through that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>Every effort should, however, be made to organize, equip, and arm as many troops as possible in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, in order to render the <rs>Ohio</rs> and <rs>Indiana</rs> regiments available for other operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>At as early a day as practicable it would be well to protect and reopen the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/><placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> should be occupied by garrisons sufficient to retain them in our possession.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>To revert to the <rs>West</rs>, it is probable that no very large additions to the troops now in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> will be necessary to secure that State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>I presume that the force required for the movement down the <rs>Mississippi</rs> will be determined by its commander and the <rs>President</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>When we have reorganized our main army here <num value="10000">10,000</num> men ought to be enough to protect the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>and the <rs>Potomac</rs>; <num value="5000">5,000</num> will garrison <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <num value="3000">3,000</num> <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>, and not more than <num value="20000">20,000</num> will be necessary at the utmost for the defence of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>The force must be supplied with the necessary engineer and pontoon trains, and with transportation for everything save tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>Its general line of operations should be so directed that water-transportation can be availed of from point to point by means of the ocean and the rivers emptying into it. An essential feature of the plan of operations will be the employment of a strong naval force to protect the movement of a fleet of transports intended to convey a considerable body of troops from point to point of the enemy's sea-coast, thus either creating diversions and rendering it necessary for them to detach largely from their main body in order to protect such of their cities as may be threatened, or else landing and forming establishments on their coast at any favorable places that opportunity might offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>This naval force should also co-operate with the main army in its efforts to seize the important seaboard towns of the rebels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>It cannot be ignored that the construction of railroads has introduced a new and very important element into war, by the great facilities thus given for concentrating at particular positions large masses of troops from remote sections, and by creating new strategic points and lines of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>It is intended to overcome this difficulty by the partial operations suggested, and such other as the particular case may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>We must endeavor to seize places on the railways in the rear of the enemy's points of concentration, and me must threaten their seaboard cities, in order that each State may be forced, by the necessity of its own defence, to diminish its contingent to the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>The proposed movement down the <rs>Mississippi</rs> will produce important results in this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>That advance and the progress of the main army at the <rs>East</rs> will materially assist each other by diminishing the resistance to be encountered by each.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>The tendency of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> movement upon all questions connected with cotton is too well understood by the <rs>President</rs> and cabinet to need any illustration from me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>There is another independent movement that has often been <pb id="p.104" n="104"/>suggested and which has always recommended itself to my judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>I refer to a movement from <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> through the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Indian Territory</placeName> upon <placeName reg="Red River, Brown, Texas" key="tgn,2611953">Red river</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Texas</placeName> for the purpose of protecting, and developing the latent Union and free-State sentiment well known to predominate in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Texas</placeName>, and which, like a similar sentiment in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, will, if protected, ultimately organize that section into a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>How far it will be possible to support this movement by an advance through <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> from <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> is a matter which I have not sufficiently examined to be able to express a decided opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>If at all practicable, it is eminently desirable, as bringing into play the resources and warlike qualities of the <rs>Pacific States</rs>, as well as identifying them with our cause and connecting the bond of union between them and the general government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>If it is not departing too far from my province, I will venture to suggest the policy of an ultimate alliance and cordial understanding with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; their sympathies and interests are with us, their antipathies exclusively against our enemies and their institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>I think it would not be difficult to obtain from the <rs>Mexican</rs> government the right to use, at least during the present contest, the road from Guaymas to <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>; this concession would very materially reduce the obstacles of the column moving from the <rs>Pacific</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>A similar permission to use their territory for the passage of troops between the <rs>Panuco</rs> and the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> would enable us to throw a column of troops by a good road from <placeName key="tgn,1018380" n="1.000 4" reg="tampico,tamaulipas,mexico,north and central america">Tampico</placeName>, or some of the small harbors north of it, upon and across the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, without risk and scarcely firing a shot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>To what extent, if any, it would be desirable to take into service and employ <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> soldiers is a question entirely political, on which I do not venture to offer an opinion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>The force I have recommended is large; the expense is great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>It is possible that a smaller force might accomplish the object in view, but I understand it to be the purpose of this great nation to re-establish the power of its government and restore peace to its citizens in the shortest possible time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>The question to be decided is simply this: Shall we crush the rebellion at <num value="1">one</num> blow, terminate the war in <num value="1">one</num> campaign, or shall we leave it as a legacy for our descendants?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>When the extent of the possible line of operations is considered, the force asked for for the main army under my command cannot be regarded as unduly large; every mile we advance carries us further from our base of operations and renders detachments necessary to cover our communications, while the enemy will be constantly concentrating as he falls back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>I propose, with the force which I have requested, not only to drive the enemy out of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and occupy <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, but to occupy <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0102.0006.00104.00580" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, <pb id="p.105" n="105"/><placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and New Orleans; in other words to move into the heart of the enemy's country and crush the rebellion in its very heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>By seizing and repairing the railroads as we advance the difficulties of transportation will be materially diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>It is perhaps unnecessary to state that, in addition to the forces named in this memorandum, strong reserves should be formed, ready to supply any losses that may occur.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>In conclusion, I would submit that the exigencies of the treasury may be lessened by making only partial payments to our troops when in the enemy's country, and by giving the obligations of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for such supplies as may there be obtained. </p><closer><signed><persName n="McClellan,,George,B.,," id="n0102.0006.00105.00581" reg="expanded:McClellan,George,Brinton,,"><foreName n="George">Geo.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName>  <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Maj.-Gen.</rs></signed></closer></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>In the light of the experience of the <measure n="22years" type="date">twenty-two years</measure> which have elapsed since this Memorandum was so hastily prepared, and after full consideration of all the events of the long and bloody war which followed it, I still hold to the soundness of the views it expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>Had the measures recommended been carried into effect the war would have been closed in less than <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the time and with infinite saving of blood and treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>So far as I know, it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> general plan of operations proposed upon a scale adequate to the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>It recognized the importance of railways as a new element in strategy; it emphasized the vital importance of the railway system leading from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> to the <rs>East</rs>; it marked out the advantages to be derived from coast expeditions; it stated the part to be played upon the <rs>Mississippi</rs>; it foreshadowed the marches upon <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and the sea-coast; it called for a force which the future proved to be fully within our means, and which would have crushed the rebellion in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> campaigns.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>By calling in the commands of <persName n="Banks,General,,,," id="n0102.0006.00106.00586" reg="mostcommon:Banks,N.,P.,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stone,General,,,," id="n0102.0006.00106.00587" reg="mostcommon:Stone,C.,P.,,:14"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Stone</surname></persName> it will probably be sufficient to defend the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> from whatever direction it may be assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>It is well understood that, although the ultimate design of the enemy is to possess himself of the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> efforts will be directed towards <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, with the intention of cutting our line of communication and supplies, as well as to arouse an insurrection in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>To accomplish this he will no doubt show a certain portion of his force in front of our positions on the other side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, in order to engage our attention there and induce us to leave a large portion of our force for the defence of those positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>He will probably also make demonstrations in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Aquia Creek, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1132269">Acquia Creek</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mathias Point, King George, Virginia" key="tgn,2496456">Mathias Point</placeName>, and the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, in order still further to induce us to disseminate our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>His main and real movement will doubtless be to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> between <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=31" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Point of Rocks</placeName>, probably not far from <placeName key="tgn,2652408" n="1.000 1" reg="seneca mills, yates, new york">Seneca Mills</placeName>, and most likely at more points than <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>His hope will be so to engage our attention by the diversions already named as to enable him to move with a large force direct and unopposed on <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>I see no reason to doubt the possibility of his attempting this with a column of at least <num value="100000">100,000</num> effective troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>If he has only <num value="130000">130,000</num> under arms, he can make all the diversions I have mentioned with his raw and badly organized troops, leaving <num value="100000">100,000</num> effective men for his real movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>As I am now situated I can by no possibility bring to bear against this column more than <num value="70000">70,000</num>, and probably not over <num value="60000">60,000</num>, effective troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>In regard to the composition of our active army, it must be borne in mind that the very important arms of cavalry and artillery had been almost entirely neglected until I assumed command of this army, and that consequently the troops of these arms, although greatly increased in numbers, are comparatively raw and inexperienced, most of the cavalry not being yet armed or equipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>In making the foregoing estimate of numbers I have reduced the enemy's force below what is regarded by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and other official circles as its real strength, and have taken the reverse course as to our own. Our situation, <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>then, is simply this: if the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of the enemy follows the simplest dictates of the military art we must meet him with greatly inferior forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>To render success possible the divisions of our army must be more ably led and commanded than those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>The fate of the nation and the success of the cause in which we are engaged must be mainly decided by the issue of the next battle to be fought by the army now under my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>I therefore feel that the interests of the nation demand that the ablest soldiers in the service should be on duty with the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, and that, contenting ourselves with remaining on the defensive for the present at all other points, this army should at once be reinforced by all the effective troops that the <name>East</name> and <name>West</name> and <name>North</name> can furnish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>In view of these facts I respectfully urge that all the available troops in <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>, and at least <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> troops (there being <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> there unarmed), and all those of the <rs>Eastern</rs> and Northern States, be at once directed to report to me for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>I beg leave to repeat the opinion I have heretofore expressed: that the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> should number not less than <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> men in order to insure complete success and an early termination of the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>The organized armies of modern times consist of <num value="2">two</num> well-defined parts: the fighting force, or <quote>line,</quote> and <quote>the staff,</quote> which directs, inspects, and supplies the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>The line is made up of infantry, artillery, cavalry, and engineer troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>As infantry can move wherever a man can set his foot, can fight on all kinds of ground, gives the most destructive fire of all the arms, and is the least expensive and most easily instructed, it constitutes the great bulk of all large armies, and is decidedly the most important.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>With equally good generals, that army which has the best infantry is pretty sure to win, for no reasonable superiority in the other arms of service can compensate for marked inferiority in the infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>The essential qualities of good infantry are: the ability to make long marches, with their full equipment, without straggling; accuracy of fire; confidence in their ability to use the bayonet &mdash; for this will prevent their breaking upon the very near approach of a hostile line &mdash; coolness, intelligence, determination, and mutual confidence in attacking or receiving an attack; the ability to reform rapidly after a successful attack, and to rally when driven back, either after a repulsed attack or when obliged to retreat from a defensive position; the power of enduring fatigue, exposure, and hunger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Next in importance is the artillery, whose work it is to open the way for, and cover the movements of, the other arms by destroying the enemy's defences at long range, silencing his artillery, and demoralizing his infantry; or, at short ranges, to crush them by a rapid fire of case and shrapnel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>It is also a part of its duty to cover the retreat of beaten infantry, and to assist in the operations of detached bodies of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/><pb id="p.109" n="109"/></p> 
<p>There is thus <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>, whose business it is to handle siege-guns and those used in permanent defences, and <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field-artillery</orgName>, who accompany an army in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/><orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">Field-artillery</orgName> is made up of <num value="3">three</num> kinds &mdash; viz., the mounted batteries, whose cannoneers usually march on foot, but during rapid movements ride upon the carriages and caissons, and which serve with the regiment, division, and <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>; the <orgName n="Horse Battery" type="battery">horse-batteries</orgName>, whose cannoneers are provided with saddle-horses, and which are especially intended for service with the cavalry; and the batteries of position, consisting of the heaviest field-guns, intended especially for action against the enemy's material defences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>The field-guns, at the period of which I write, were generally provided in the ratio of at least <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> guns to each <num value="1000">thousand</num> infantry, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> guns to each <num value="1000">thousand</num> cavalry, the exact proportion depending somewhat on the nature of the field of war and the quality of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>With raw troops a somewhat larger proportion is necessary than with veterans.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>The technical information necessary for the artillery officers and men renders it difficult to improvise thoroughly efficient artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>The cavalry is an indispensable part of every army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>It not only takes part, as occasion demands, in general battles, but, with a due proportion of <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse-artillery</orgName>, is capable of independent action, even at long distances from the main body of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>Upon it devolves to a great extent the duty of observing and discovering the positions, movements, and strength of the enemy, as well as masking those of its own army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>It is capable of making extensive inroads into the enemy's country, and is usually employed to threaten and attack his communications, supply-trains, etc. The modern improvements in firearms have certainly affected the employment of cavalry on the field of battle against infantry and artillery, but have not lessened the importance of its other duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>Nor is it probable that the number of these arms will in the future be materially diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>The employment of breech-loading small arms has added very much to the strength of cavalry, and it is certain that in future wars large bodies of cavalry will be employed as mounted infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>That is, they will use their horses to move rapidly to the point of action, and fight on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>Under ordinary circumstances it has usually been regarded <pb id="p.110" n="110"/>as advisable to furnish cavalry to the extent of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> of the infantry force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>To render cavalry efficient it is necessary that the officers and men should be of a superior order of intelligence, and that they should fully understand the care of their horses, which should be active and enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>Officers and men should be excellent horsemen, skilful in the use of their weapons, and thoroughly instructed in the work of reconnoissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>It is really much more difficult to form reliable cavalry at short notice than to instruct artillery and infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>It is the duty of engineer troops to conduct siege operations; to supervise and construct temporary defences and the works for their attack; to construct, repair, and destroy bridges of all kinds, fords, roads, etc. The repair and destruction of railways should also be under their direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>The performance of these duties requires a superior order of men, skilled in some mechanical trade, and needs careful instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>In ordinary cases the engineer troops should number about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="40" type="ordinal">fortieth</num> of the infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>To direct the movements and supply the wants of the combatants is the business of the staff which in modern armies is a complicated and extensive organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>He objected to all I proposed, save the brigade formation, saying that under our system and regulations it would be impossible to administer the affairs of an <quote>army,</quote> and that the retention of the system and nomenclature of geographical divisions and departments was an absolute necessity; he also objected to the formation of divisions as unnecessary, for the reason that in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> he had only brigades.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>I called to his attention the fact that, all the world over, fighting forces were organized as armies; that I had done so in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>; and that his force in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> was a very small affair in comparison with that soon to be collected in front of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>He did not change his views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>I used this lam not only to furnish the requisite number of actual aides-de-camp, but also to give additional pay and rank in the regular army to officers whose duty made such a step necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/><num value="1">One</num> of the greatest defects in our military system is the lack of a thoroughly instructed staff corps, from which should be furnished chief of staff of armies, <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> and divisions, adjutant-general, and aides-de-camp and recruiting officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>Perhaps the greatest difficulty that I encountered in the work of creating the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> arose from the scarcity of thoroughly instructed staff officers, and I must frankly state that every day I myself felt the disadvantages under which I personally labored from the want of that thorough theoretical and practical education received by the officers of the <name>German</name> <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>Under our system of government, and in the circumstances which surround us, it is perhaps impossible, certainly very improbable, that this most vital point can ever be satisfactorily covered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>Political and personal considerations now control so completely the appointment to places in the various branches of the staff that the chances are against their being filled by the most competent men. In fact, judging from the experience of the past few years, it is almost a certainty that incompetent men will be selected for these most important positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>Inefficiency and waste must surely result from our present system, even in times of peace; but in the event of our being thrown into collision with a well-organized <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> army, the results will be disastrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>I am very sure that every general officer who served in the late war will agree with me that his <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>labors would have been immensely lightened and the efficiency of his command very much increased if he could have had a competent staff at his disposal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>In comparison with the difficulties of the work that fell to my lot the task of a general officer of the <name>German</name> army seems mere child's play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>That was a great advantage, but by no means all that was required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>Those whom I selected were usually comparatively young men, and, under my direction, soon grasped the situation; but <num value="1">one</num> very great obstacle arose from the incompetence of many of the permanent heads of departments, who found it very difficult to get out of the ruts in which they had been accustomed to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>During the war many improvements were made in the details of the administration of the staff corps; but unfortunately no change whatever has been made in the organization of the various departments, and their only gain by the war is in the personal experience of the officers who served therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>I have already stated in a general way what occurred between myself and some of the radical leaders shortly after I reached <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>They then saw clearly that it would not be possible to make a party tool of me, and soon concluded that it was their policy to ruin me if possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>It had been clearly stated by Congress and the general government that the sole object of the war was the <quote>preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> and the prevention of the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>We fought to keep them in the <rs>Union</rs>, and the practically unanimous sentiment of the army, as well as of the mass of the people, was at that time strongly in favor of confining the war to that object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>Although the <rs>Free-Soil</rs> element was strong in the <rs>North</rs>, the <name>Abolitionists</name> proper were weak, and a declaration of their true purposes would have seriously interfered with the progress of the war. A clear indication of the correctness of this statement lies in the fact that the executive never disowned my proclamation to the <name>West Virginians</name> nor the policy I pursued in reference to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>The real object of the radical leaders was not the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, but the permanent ascendency of their party, and to this they were ready to sacrifice the <rs>Union</rs>, if necessary.<note anchored="yes" n="*">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>A few days before the arrival of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00149.00879" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> in <orgName n="Washington Congress" type="congress">Washington Congress</orgName> had stated the purposes of the war in a resolution: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, now in revolt against the constitutional government, and in arms around the capital; that in this national emergency Congress, banishing all feeling of mere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to its country; that this war is not waged, on our part, in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and to preserve the <rs>Union</rs>, with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired; and as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease.</p></quote></note> <pb id="p.150" n="150"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>They committed a grave error in supposing me to be politically ambitious and in thinking that I looked forward to military success as a means of reaching the presidential chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>At the same time they knew that if I achieved marked success my influence would necessarily be very great throughout the country &mdash; an influence which I should certainly have used for the good of the whole country, and not for that of any party at the nation's expense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>They therefore determined to ruin me in any event and by any means: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by endeavoring to force me into premature movements, knowing that a failure would probably end my military career; afterwards by withholding the means necessary to achieve success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>That they were not honest is proved by the fact that, having failed to force me to advance at a time when an advance would have been madness, they withheld the means of success when I was in contact with the enemy, and finally relieved me from command when the game was in my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>They determined that I should not succeed, and carried out their determinations only too well and at a fearful sacrifice of blood, time, and treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>In the <rs>East</rs> alone it is quite safe to say that we unnecessarily lost more than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a <num value="1000000">million</num> in killed, wounded, and prisoners in consequence of my being withdrawn from the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> and not properly supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>Taking both <name>East</name> and <name>West</name>, and counting the losses also by disease, I do not doubt that more than half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men were sacrificed unnecessarily for the sake of insuring the success of a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>I do not base my assertions as to the motives of the radical leaders upon mere surmises, but upon facts that have frequently come to my knowledge during the war and since.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>He said that during the very early part of the <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular campaign</rs> he was <num value="1">one</num> of a commission sent from New York to urge more vigorous action in supporting me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/><pb id="p.151" n="151"/>To end the war before the nation was ready for that would be a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>The war must be prolonged, and conducted so as to achieve that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>That the people of the <rs>North</rs> were not yet ready to accept that view, and that it would not answer to permit me to succeed until the people had been worked up to the proper pitch on that question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>That the war would not be finished until that result was reached, and that, therefore, it was not their policy to strengthen <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00151.00884" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> so as to insure his success.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>I have heard, from the best authority, many instances in which the same views were expressed by other prominent radical leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>There was no friend of yours present to contradict these statements, of course.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>As a further proof that the administration did not intend the <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular campaign</rs> to be successful may be cited the fact that on the <dateStruct value="1862-04-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after left <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> to assume command in the field, there was issued <rs n="General Order 33" type="misc">General Order No. 33</rs>, closing all the recruiting depots for the volunteers and stopping all recruiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>It is hardly credible that the members of the administration were ignorant of the fact that an army in the field must meet with some losses under the most favorable circumstances, and that to stop all supplies of men at such a juncture is the most unpardonable of follies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>I had no reason to suspect his sincerity, and therefore believed him to be what he professed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>The most disagreeable thing about him was the extreme virulence with which he abused the <rs>President</rs>, the administration, and the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>He carried this to such an extent that I was often shocked by it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>He never gave them credit for honesty or patriotism, and very seldom for any ability.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>At some time during the autumn of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> <persName n="Cameron,Secretary,,,," id="n0102.0009.00152.00894" reg="nearbymention:Cameron,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName> made quite an abolition speech to some newly arrived regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>He often advocated the propriety of my seizing the government and taking affairs into my own hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>As he always expressed himself in favor of putting down the rebellion at any cost, I always regarded these extreme views as the ebullitions of an intense and patriotic nature, and sometimes wasted more or less time in endeavoring to bring him to more moderate views, never dreaming that all the while this man was in close communication with the very men whom he so violently abused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>His purpose was to endeavor to climb upon my shoulders and then throw me down.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>I interfered, and by my action with the <rs>President</rs> no doubt saved him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>He, so far as I knew, occupied himself solely with contracts and political affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>For instance, it often happened, especially toward the close of his administration, that when a shipment of unusually good arms arrived from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and I wished them for the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, I found that they had been promised to some political friend who might be engaged in raising a prospective regiment in some remote State, and I could not get them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>So with regard to other articles of equipment, and to batteries and regiments which I desired for the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>As I had no idea who might be selected in <persName n="Cameron,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00153.00900" reg="nearbymention:Cameron,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName>'s place, and as he supported me in purely military matters, I objected to his removal and saved him. He was made aware of this at the time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>Finally, <num value="1">one</num> day when I returned to my house from my day's work and was dressing for dinner, a lady of my family told me that <persName n="Key,Colonel,,,," id="n0102.0009.00153.00901" reg="mostcommon:Key,Thomas,M.,,:3"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Key</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of my aides, had just been there to inform me that <persName n="Cameron,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00153.00902" reg="nearbymention:Cameron,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName> had resigned and that <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00153.00903" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> was appointed in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation that I had of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>Before I had finished my toilet <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00153.00904" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s card came up, and as soon as possible I went down to see him. He told me that he had been appointed <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and that his name had been sent to the <name>Senate</name> for confirmation, and that he had called to confer with me as to his acceptance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>He said that acceptance would involve very great personal sacrifices on his part, and that the only possible inducement would be that he might have it in his power to aid me in the work of putting down the rebellion; that he was willing to devote all his time, intellect, and energy to my assistance, and that together we could soon bring the war to an end. If I wished him to accept he would do so, but only on my account; that he had come to know my wishes and determine accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>I told him that I hoped he would accept the position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>Soon after <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00153.00905" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> became <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> it became clear that, without any reason known to me, our relations had completely changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>Instead of using his new position to assist me he threw every obstacle in my way, and did all in his power to create difficulty and distrust between the <rs>President</rs> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>I soon found it impossible to gain access to him. Before he was in office he constantly ran after me and professed the most <pb id="p.154" n="154"/>ardent friendship; as soon as he became <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> his whole manner changed, and I could no longer find the opportunity to transact even the ordinary current business of the office with him. It is now very clear to me that, far from being, as he had always represented himself to me, in direct and violent opposition to the radicals, he was really in secret alliance with them, and that he and they were alike unwilling that I should be successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>No other theory can possibly account for his and their course, and on that theory everything becomes clear and easily explained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>Had I been successful in my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaign the rebellion would perhaps have been terminated without the immediate abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>To gain their ends with the <rs>President</rs> they played upon his apprehensions for the safety of Washington-growing out of his complete ignorance of war &mdash; as well as upon his personal aspirations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>I believe that the leaders of the radical branch of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> preferred political control in <num value="1">one</num> section of a divided country to being in the minority in a restored Union.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>Not only did these people desire the abolition of slavery, but its abolition in such a manner and under such circumstances that the slaves would at once be endowed with the electoral franchise, while the intelligent white man of the <rs>South</rs> should be deprived of it, and permanent control thus be secured through the votes of the ignorant slaves, composing so large a portion of the population of the seceded States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>Influenced by these motives, they succeeded but too well in sowing the seeds of distrust in <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00154.00906" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:25"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s mind, so that, even before I actually commenced the <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular campaign</rs>, I had lost that cordial support of the executive which was necessary to attain success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>It may be said that under these circumstances it was my duty to resign my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>But I had become warmly attached to the soldiers, who already had learned to love me well; all my pride was wrapped up in the army that I had created, and I knew of no commander at all likely to be assigned to it in my place who would be competent to conduct its operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>Nor did I at that time fully realize the length to which these men were prepared to go in carrying out their schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>For instance, I did not suspect, until the orders reached me, that <pb id="p.155" n="155"/><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> and the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName> would be withdrawn from my control; and when those orders arrived they found me too far committed to permit me to withdraw with honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>With the troops under fire it did not become me to offer my resignation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>The difficulties of my position in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> commenced when I was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> confined to my bed with typhoid fever in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> (<dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>) for some <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, and culminated soon after <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00155.00907" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> became <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>Up to this time there had been no serious difficulty; there were slight murmurs of impatience at the delay in moving, but all sensible and well-informed men saw the impossibility of entering upon a campaign at that season, and no party was as yet openly formed against me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>My malady was supposed to be more serious than it really was; for, although very weak and ill, my strong constitution enabled me to retain a clear intellect during the most trying part of the illness, so that I daily transacted business and gave the necessary orders, never for a moment abandoning the direction of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>As is often the case with such diseases, I sometimes passed days and nights without sleeping, and it more than once happened that the <rs>President</rs> called while I was asleep after such intervals of wakefulness, and, being denied admittance, his anxiety induced him to think that my disease was very acute and would terminate fatally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>The radical leaders skilfully availed themselves of the state of affairs to drive in an entering wedge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>They represented to the <rs>President</rs> that as I kept my own counsels and was not in the habit of consulting or advising with others, but acted entirely on my own judgment, no <num value="1">one</num> but myself knew the exact condition of the army, its state of preparation, or the designs I had in view; that, should my malady terminate suddenly and fatally, great confusion would ensue, and that it was necessary to provide against such an emergency by causing a secret examination to be made immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inkling of this came through <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00155.00908" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, not yet <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, who said to me: <quote>They are counting on your death, and are already dividing among themselves your military goods and chattels.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>The fact was that, although I was in the habit of acting solely on my own judgment, and never told more of my intentions than <pb id="p.156" n="156"/>was absolutely necessary, I always consulted freely with the chiefs of the staff departments, each of whom knew the exact condition of affairs in his own department and could give to any properly authorized person all necessary explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>So that a secret examination was not only unnecessary, but could not produce as good results as the honest, direct way of coming to me and directing me to instruct my staff to explain the state of affairs to the <rs>President</rs> or <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>. <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00909" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Franklin,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00910" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,William,B.,,:10"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and, I think, <persName n="Meigs,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00911" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><surname>Meigs</surname></persName> were entrusted by the <rs>President</rs> with this business.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>This information reached me when the crisis of my malady was over, and learning &mdash; also through <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00914" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>--that a grand conclave was to assemble without my knowledge, I mustered strength enough on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> (<dateStruct value="1862-01-12"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg="12">12</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>) to be driven to the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, where my unexpected appearance caused very much the effect of a shell in a powder-magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>It was very clear from the manner of those I met there that there was something of which they were ashamed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>I made no allusion to what I knew, nor was anything said to me on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>But I took advantage of the occasion to explain to the <rs>President</rs> in a general and casual way what my intentions were; and before I left he told me that there was to be a meeting at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> next day, and invited me to attend, but made no reference to the object of the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>At the designated hour I went to the <rs>President</rs>'s office and there met a party consisting of the <rs>President</rs>, <persName n="Seward,Secretary,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00915" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretaries</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <persName n="Chase,Secretary,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00916" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Secretary"></roleName><surname>Chase</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Blair,Secretary,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00917" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Secretary"></roleName><surname>Blair</surname></persName>, <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00918" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Franklin,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00919" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,William,B.,,:10"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Meigs,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00920" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Meigs</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>I do not think that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> (<persName n="Cameron,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00921" reg="nearbymention:Cameron,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName>) was present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>I sat by <persName n="Blair,Secretary,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00922" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName> and <persName n="Meigs,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00923" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Meigs</surname></persName>, and entered into conversation with them upon topics of general interest having no possible bearing upon any subject that could be brought before the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>Meanwhile there was a good deal of whispering among the others, in which I do not think <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00924" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,William,B.,,:10"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> took any special part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>Finally <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00156.00925" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> said he wished to explain to me the part he had in the examination, which had commenced, into the state of the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>Exactly what he said has escaped my memory, except that he <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>disclaimed any purpose hostile to me, and based what had been done on the ground of the supposed critical nature of my illness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>I stopped the explanation by saying that as I was now again restored to health the case had changed, and that, as the examination must now cease, further explanations were unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>I then quietly resumed my conversation with <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00927" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> and <persName n="Meigs,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00928" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><surname>Meigs</surname></persName>, awaiting further developments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>The whispering then recommenced, especially between the <rs>President</rs> and <persName n="Chase,Secretary,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00929" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>; when at length the latter (<persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00930" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>) spoke aloud, for the benefit of all assembled, in a very excited tone and manner, saying that he understood the purpose of the meeting to be that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00931" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> should then and there explain his military plans in detail, that they might be submitted to the approval or disapproval of the gentlemen present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>The uncalled &mdash; for violence of his manner surprised me, but I determined to avail myself of it by keeping perfectly cool myself, and contented myself with remarking-what was entirely true &mdash; that the purpose he expressed was entirely new to me; that I did not recognize the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> as in any manner my official superior, and that I denied his right to question me upon the military affairs committed to my charge; that in the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> alone did I recognize the right to interrogate me. I then quietly resumed my conversation with <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00932" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> and <persName n="Meigs,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00933" reg="mostcommon:Meigs,M.,C.,,:1"><surname>Meigs</surname></persName>, taking no further notice of <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00934" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>I must again state that this meeting had been arranged when I was supposed to be too ill to attend, and that the original and real purpose was not as <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00935" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> stated it, but <quote>to dispose of the military goods and chattels</quote> of the sick man so inopportunely restored to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>In another connection I have already stated that some weeks before the date of this meeting I had given <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0009.00157.00937" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> a sketch of the proposed <placeName reg="Urbanna, Middlesex, Virginia" key="tgn,2114705">Urbana</placeName> movement, and that he was much pleased with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>I presume the after-thought, and the object of the intrigues, cut short by my recovery, was to take advantage of this plan by having it carried into effect by <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0102.0009.00158.00941" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,Irwin,,,:2"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>In no other way can I account for the uncalled &mdash; for irritation displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>This impression is strengthened by other circumstances which will appear as I proceed with my story.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>To return to the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>After I had thus disposed of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> he resumed his whispering with the <rs>President</rs>, who, after the lapse of some minutes, said: <quote>Well, <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0102.0009.00158.00942" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, I think you had better tell us what your plans are</quote> --or words to that effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>To this I replied, in substance, that if the <rs>President</rs> had confidence in me it was not right or necessary to entrust my designs to the judgment of others, but that if his confidence was so slight as to require my opinions to be fortified by those of other persons it would be wiser to replace me by some <num value="1">one</num> fully possessing his confidence; that no general commanding an army would willingly submit his plans to the judgment of such an assembly, in which some were incompetent to form a valuable opinion, and others incapable of keeping a secret, so that anything made known to them would soon spread over <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and become known to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>I also reminded the <rs>President</rs> that he and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> knew in general terms what my designs were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>Finally, I declined giving any further information to the meeting, unless the <rs>President</rs> gave me the order in writing and assumed the responsibility of the results.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2666"/>When I started for <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> I plainly stated to the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> that the chief object of the operation would be to open the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> by crossing the river in force at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>; that I had collected the material for making a permanent bridge by means of canal-boats; that, from the nature of the river, it was doubtful whether such a bridge could be constructed; that if it could not I would at least occupy the ground in front of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, in order to cover the rebuilding of the railroad bridge; and finally, when the communications were perfectly secure, move on <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>When I arrived at the place I found the bateau bridge nearly completed; the holding-ground proved better than had been anticipated; the weather was favorable, there being no wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>I at once crossed over the <num value="2">two</num> brigades which had arrived, and took steps to hurry up the other <num value="2">two</num>, belonging respectively to <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0102.0011.00192.01249" reg="nearbymention:Banks,N.,P.,,"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n0102.0011.00192.01250" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,J.,,,:1"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>The difficulty of crossing supplies had not then become apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>That night I telegraphed for a regiment of regular cavalry and <num value="4">four</num> batteries of <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> to come up the next day (<dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>), besides directing <orgName n="division"><persName n="Keyes,,,,," id="n0102.0011.00192.01251" reg="mostcommon:Keyes,E.,D.,,:4"><surname>Keyes</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> of infantry to be moved up on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>Next morning the attempt was made to pass the canal-boats <pb id="p.193" n="193"/>through the lift-lock, in order to commence at once the construction of a permanent bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>It was then found for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that the lock was too small to permit the passage of the boats, it having been built for a class of boats running on the <rs type="place">Shenandoah canal</rs>, and too narrow by some <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> for the canal-boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>The lift-locks, above and below, are all large enough for the ordinary boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>I had seen them at <placeName reg="Edward's Ferry">Edward's Ferry</placeName> thus used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>It had always been represented to the engineers by the military railroad employees and others that the lock <hi rend="italics">was</hi> large enough, and, the difference being too small to be detected by the eye, no <num value="1">one</num> had thought of measuring it or suspected any difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>I thus suddenly found myself unable to build the permanent bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>A violent gale had arisen, which threatened the safety of our only means of communication; the narrow approach to the bridge was so crowded and clogged with wagons that it was very clear that, under existing circumstances, nothing more could be done than to cross over the baggage and supplies of the <num value="2">two</num> brigades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>Of these, instead of being able to cross both during the morning, the last arrived only in time to go over just before dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>It was evident that the troops under orders would only be in the way, should they arrive, and that it would not be possible to subsist them for a rapid march on <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>It was therefore deemed necessary to countermand the order, content ourselves with covering the reopening of the railroad for the present, and in the meantime use every exertion to establish, as promptly as possible, depots of forage and subsistence on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side to supply the troops and enable them to move on <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> independently of the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>The next day (<dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>) I sent a strong reconnoissance to <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>, and, under its protection, went there myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>I then determined to hold that place, and to move the troops composing <persName n="Lander,,,,," id="n0102.0011.00193.01252" reg="nearbymention:Lander,F.,W.,,"><surname>Lander</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Williams,,,,," id="n0102.0011.00193.01253" reg="mostcommon:Williams,Seth,,,:10"><surname>Williams</surname></persName>'s commands at once on <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>, thus effectually covering the reconstruction of the railroad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>Having done this, and taken all the steps in my power to insure the rapid transmission of supplies over the river, I returned to this city, well satisfied with what had been accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>While up the river I learned that the <rs>President</rs> was dissatisfied with the state of affairs; but, on my return here, understood from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> that upon learning the whole state of the case the <rs>President</rs> was fully satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>I contented myself, therefore, with giving to the secretary a brief statement, about as I have written it here; he did not even require that much of me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>The design aimed at was entirely accomplished, and the <pb id="p.194" n="194"/>railroad was in running order before I started for the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>As a demonstration against his left flank this movement had much to do with the enemy's evacuation of his position at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-03-08"><day reg="8">8th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-03-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>; and I should state that I made the movement unwillingly, because I anticipated precisely that effect, and did not wish them to move from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> until I had fairly commenced the movement to the lower <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>But the pressure was so strong that I could not resist it; and this was no doubt the best and easiest way to force the navigation of the lower Potomac, which the administration laid so much stress upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>He appeared much concerned about something, and soon said that he wished to talk with me about <quote>a very ugly matter.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>I asked what it was; and, as he still hesitated, I said that the sooner and more directly such things were approached the better.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>He then referred to the <rs type="place">Harper's Ferry</rs> affair (the boats being too wide for the lift-locks, etc.), upon which I found that the secretary had deceived me when he said that the <rs>President</rs> was satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>He told me that he had never heard of my memorandum or of any explanation on my part.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>He then adverted to the more serious &mdash; or ugly &mdash; matter, and now the effects of the intrigues by which he had been surrounded became apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>He said that it had been represented <pb id="p.196" n="196"/>to him (and he certainly conveyed to me the distinct impression that he regarded these representations as well founded) that my plan of campaign (which was to leave <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> under the protection of a sufficient garrison, its numerous well-built and well-armed fortifications, and the command of <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0102.0011.00196.01263" reg="nearbymention:Banks,N.,P.,,"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, then in the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName>, and to throw the whole active army suddenly by water from <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> to the forts on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and thence by the shortest route upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>) was conceived with the traitorous intent of removing its defenders from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, and thus giving over to the enemy the capital and the government, thus left defence-less.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>It is difficult to understand that a man of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0102.0011.00196.01264" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s intelligence could give ear to such abominable nonsense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>I was seated when he said this, concluding with the remark that it did look to him much like treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>Upon this I arose, and, in a manner perhaps not altogether decorous towards the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">chief magistrate</rs>, desired that he should retract the expression, telling him that I could permit no <num value="1">one</num> to couple the word treason with my name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>He was much agitated, and at once disclaimed any idea of considering me a traitor, and said that he merely repeated what others had said, and that he did not believe a word of it. I suggested caution in the use of language, and again said that I would permit no doubt to be thrown upon my intentions; whereupon he again apologized and disclaimed any purpose of impugning my motives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>I then informed him that I had called a meeting of the generals of division for that day with reference to the proposed attack upon the enemy's <placeName reg="Potomac batteries">Potomac batteries</placeName>, and suggested that my plan should be laid before them in order that he might be satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>This was done, and I heard no more of treason in that connection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>Before leaving this subject I will call attention to the fact that my official report contained the statement that the secretary had assured me of the <rs>President</rs>'s approval of my action when I returned from the upper Potomac, and that this assertion was never denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>Moreover, no other statement made in the memorandum was ever denied or objected to either by the <rs>President</rs> or the secretary; and that memorandum shows very clearly that there was no ground of dissatisfaction with my conduct, but that <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>I did precisely what I told them I should do under given circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>In my official report I have given all necessary information as to the reasons which prevented an attack upon the enemy's batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>I will here repeat only that careful reconnoissances and a full consideration of the matter led to the inevitable conclusion that although we might, at a greater or less sacrifice of life, carry and destroy any particular battery, we could prevent the construction of permanent batteries and the employment of rifled field-batteries only by a general movement of the army to drive the enemy entirely behind the Rappahan-neck and <placeName reg="Rapidan, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129009">Rapidan</placeName>, after a general action; and that it would then be necessary to hold the lines of those rivers in force or continue the campaign by the overland route.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>I did not regard the inconvenience resulting from the presence of the enemy's batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs> as sufficiently great to justify the direct efforts necessary to dislodge them, especially since it was absolutely certain that they would evacuate all their positions as soon as they became aware of the movement to the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York rivers</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>It was therefore with the greatest reluctance that I made the arrangements required to carry out the positive orders of the government, and it was with great satisfaction that I found myself relieved from the necessity of making what I knew to be a false and unnecessary movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>When the enemy abandoned his position on the <dateStruct value="-03-08"><day reg="8">8th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-03-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, the roads were still in such a condition as to make the proposed movement upon the batteries impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>Before this time I had strongly and repeatedly urged upon the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> the propriety of hastening the completion of the <hi rend="italics">Monitor</hi>, that she might be sent to the <rs>Potomac</rs> to try her hand upon the batteries on its banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>As the reason for this I urged that it was well to try her qualities under fire, when necessary repairs and alterations could readily be made, rather than to send her immediately to New Orleans, as had been intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>It is a little singular that the effect of my urgency was to hasten her completion, so that she arrived in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> in season to check the operations of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0102.0011.00197.01265" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi>. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>Everything was to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>An army was to be created <hi rend="italics">ab initio</hi>--out of nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>Raw material there was, but it was completely raw, and was to be fashioned into shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/><rs type="role2">Private</rs> soldiers, non-commissioned officers, <rs type="role" n="Officer">officers</rs>, regiments, brigades, divisions, <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, armies, with all their staff corps, were to be organized and instructed, not merely on paper, but in effective reality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>Small arms, field-guns, siege and <orgName n="Garrison Artillery" type="artillery">garrison artillery</orgName>, ammunition, equipments, camp-equipage, bridges, ambulances, baggage and supply trains, tents, clothing &mdash; all these wonderful instruments, and <hi rend="italics">impedimenta</hi> of a modern army were to be fabricated; and not only fabricated, but so made that it would be possible to use them: so strong as to withstand a heavy strain, so light that they could be handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>It added to the difficulty of the task that no army approaching in magnitude that now required had ever existed on this continent, so that our own experience was not of much avail in the crisis so suddenly upon us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>In fact, <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest obstacles I encountered at this time was the difficulty of drawing some of the heads of departments out of the old ruts, and convincing them that what was eminently appropriate for <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men was often <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>an absurdity or impossibility for <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> times those numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>Besides all this &mdash; and going on <hi rend="italics">pari passu</hi> with it all &mdash; was the irresistible and pressing necessity of so fortifying <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> as to provide for its immediate and future safety; so that the active army of operations should not necessarily be tied down to it as its base of operations and be unable to uncover it without endangering its security.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>More yet than this, the work was to be done in the face of a victorious enemy, whose outposts were within rifle-shot of our own and in sight of the capital; the only communications of the army and the government passing, as far as to the <rs>Susquehanna</rs>, through a people of very doubtful loyalty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>Moreover, the government was utterly ignorant of military affairs and incapable of judging the necessities of the situation; too often actuated by mere motives of partisan expediency instead of patriotic resolve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>The people, also, were ignorant of war, and sure to be urged to clamorous and senseless impatience by a partisan press.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>Finally, I was not only unsupported, but sometimes thwarted by <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0102.0012.00199.01278" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, whose views often differed from my own. Under these circumstances I had only my own unwavering sense of right to sustain me. In spite of all threats and clamors I quietly persevered in the course I knew to be necessary for the safety of the nation, regardless of the result to my personal fortunes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>The work was accomplished, and I know of no case in history where so great a task was so thoroughly performed in so brief a period.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>It certainly was not till late in <dateStruct value="1861-11-"><month reg="11">Nov.</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, that the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was in any condition to move, nor even then were they capable of assaulting entrenched positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>By that time the roads had ceased to be practicable for the movement of armies, and the experience of subsequent years proved that no large operations could be advantageously conducted in that region during the winter season.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>Until my own sphere of command and responsibility was extended from the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> to all the armies, I supposed that some general plan of operations existed, but now learned that there was none such, and that utter disorganization and want of preparation pervaded the <rs>Western</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>When I learned that it was possible for the gunboats to reach the <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName> above <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>, <num value="2">two</num> operations suggested themselves to my mind as its immediate results:</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>The object of your expedition is <num value="1">one</num> of vital importance &mdash; the capture of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>The route selected is up the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> obstacle to be encountered (perhaps the only <num value="1">one</num>) is in the resistance offered by <placeName key="tgn,7017764" n="1.000 1" reg="Buras, Plaquemines, Louisiana">Forts St. Philip</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Jackson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>It is expected that the navy can reduce these works; in that case you will, after their capture, leave a sufficient garrison in them to render them perfectly secure; and it is recommended that, on the upward passage, a fern heavy guns and some troops be left at the pilot station (at the forks of the river) to cover a retreat in the event of a disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>These troops and guns will, of course, be removed as soon as the forts are captured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Should the navy fail to reduce the works you will land your forces and siege-train, and endeavor to breach the works, silence their fire, and carry them by assault.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>The next resistance will be near the <rs type="place">English Bend</rs>, where there are some earthen batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>Here it may be necessary for you to land your troops and co-operate with the naval attack, although it is more than probable that the navy unassisted can accomplish the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>If these works are taken the city of <placeName reg="New Orleans, Orleans, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014214">New Orleans</placeName> necessarily falls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>In that event it will probably be best to occupy <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName> with the mass of your troops, also the eastern bank of the river above the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>It may be necessary to place some troops <hi rend="italics">in</hi> the city to preserve order ; but if there appears to be sufficient Union sentiment to control the city, it may be best for purposes of discipline to keep your men out of the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>After obtaining possession of New Orleans it will be necessary to reduce all the works guarding its approaches from the east, and particularly to gain the <placeName key="tgn,2490192" n="1.000 1" reg="manchac, tangipahoa, louisiana">Manchac</placeName> pass.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>The only papers, to the best of my recollection, kept in my office were the retained copies of my own letters on subjects of an important nature requiring more or less secrecy, such as letters of instruction in regard to military movements.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>The relative force of the <num value="2">two</num> armies will not justify an attack on both flanks; an attack on his left flank alone involves a long line of wagon communication, and cannot prevent him from collecting for the decisive battle all the detachments now on his extreme right and left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>Should we attack his right flank by the line of the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, and a crossing of the <rs>Potomac</rs> below that river and near his batteries, we could perhaps prevent the junction of the enemy's right with his centre (we might destroy the former); we would remove the obstructions to the navigation of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, reduce the length of wagon transportation by establishing new depots at the nearest points of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and strike more directly his main railway communication.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>The fords of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> below the mouth of the <rs type="place">Bull Run</rs> are watched by the rebels; batteries are said to be placed on the heights in the rear (concealed by the woods), and the arrangement of his troops is such that he can oppose some considerable resistance to a passage of that stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>Information has just been received to the effect that the enemy are entrenching a line of heights extending from the vicinity of <persName n="Sangster,,,,," id="n0102.0013.00231.01459" reg="mostcommon:Sangster,nomatch:0"><surname>Sangster</surname></persName>'s (<placeName reg="Manassas National Battlefield Park, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Union Mills</placeName>) towards <placeName reg="Evansport, Defiance, Ohio" key="tgn,2079480">Evansport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>These circumstances indicate or prove that the enemy anticipates the movement in question, and is prepared to resist it. Assuming for the present that this operation is determined upon, it may be well to examine briefly its probable progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>In the present state of affairs our column (for the movement of so large a force must be made in several columns, at least <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num>) can reach the <rs>Accotink</rs> without danger; during the march thence to the <rs>Occoquan</rs> our right flank becomes exposed to an attack from <orgName n="Fairfax Station" type="station">Fairfax Station</orgName>, <persName n="Sangster,,,,," id="n0102.0013.00232.01462" reg="mostcommon:Sangster,nomatch:0"><surname>Sangster</surname></persName>'s, and <placeName reg="Manassas National Battlefield Park, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Union Mills</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>This danger must be met by occupying in some force either the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-named places, or, better, the point of junction of the roads leading thence to the village of <placeName reg="Occoquan, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,2113485">Occoquan</placeName>; this occupation must be continued so long as we continue to draw supplies by the roads from this city, or until a battle is won.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>The crossing of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> should be made at all the fords from <placeName reg="Wolf Run, Knox, Ohio" key="tgn,2779758">Wolf's Run</placeName> to the mouth, the points of crossing not being necessarily confined to the fords themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>Should the enemy occupy this line in force we must, with what assistance the flotilla can afford, endeavor to force the passage near the mouth, thus forcing the enemy to abandon the whole line or be taken in flank himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>Having gained the line of the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, it would be necessary to throw a column by the shortest route to <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, partly to force the enemy to abandon his batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs>, partly to cover our left flank against an attack from the direction of Acquia, and, lastly, to establish our communications with the river by the best roads, and thus give us new depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>The enemy would by this time have occupied the line of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> above <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, holding <placeName key="tgn,2110773" n="1.000 8" reg="brentsville, prince william, virginia">Brentsville</placeName> in force, and perhaps extending his lines somewhat further to the southwest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>Our next step would then be to prevent the enemy from crossing the <rs>Occoquan</rs> between <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and <placeName reg="Broad Run, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2195788">Broad Run</placeName>, to fall upon our right flank while moving on <placeName key="tgn,2110773" n="1.000 8" reg="brentsville, prince william, virginia">Brentsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>This might be effected by occupying <placeName reg="Bacon Race church">Bacon Race church</placeName> and the cross-roads near the mouth of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, or still more effectually by moving to the fords themselves and preventing, him from debouching on our side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/>These operations would possibly be resisted, and it would require some time to effect them, as, nearly at the same time as possible, we should gain the fords necessary to our purposes above <placeName reg="Broad Run, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2195788">Broad Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>Having secured our right flank, it would become necessary to carry <placeName key="tgn,2110773" n="1.000 8" reg="brentsville, prince william, virginia">Brentsville</placeName> at any cost, for we could not leave it between the right flank and the main body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>The final movement on the railroad must be determined by circumstances existing at the time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>This brief sketch brings out in bold relief the great advantage <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>possessed by the enemy in the strong central position he occupies, with roads diverging in every direction, and a strong line of defence enabling him to remain on the defensive, with a small force on <num value="1">one</num> flank, while he concentrates everything on the other for a decisive action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>Should we place a portion of our force in front of <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, while the rest crosses the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, we commit the error of dividing our army by a very difficult obstacle, and by a distance too great to enable the <num value="2">two</num> parts to support each other, should either be attacked by the masses of the enemy while the other is held in check.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>I should perhaps have dwelt more decidedly on the fact that the force left near <persName n="Sangster,,,,," id="n0102.0013.00233.01463" reg="mostcommon:Sangster,nomatch:0"><surname>Sangster</surname></persName>'s must be allowed to remain somewhere on that side of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> until the decisive battle is over, so as to cover our retreat in the event of disaster, unless it should be decided to select and entrench a new base somewhere near <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> &mdash; a proceeding involving much time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>After the passage of the <rs>Occoquan</rs> by the main army this covering force could be drawn into a more central and less exposed position &mdash; say <placeName reg="Brimstone Hill, Washington, New York" key="tgn,2195133">Brimstone Hill</placeName> or nearer the <rs>Occoquan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>In this latitude the weather will for a considerable period be very uncertain, and a movement commenced in force on roads in tolerably firm condition will be liable, almost certain, to be much delayed by rains and snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>It will, therefore, be best to impossible to surprise the enemy or take him at a disadvantage by rapid manoeuvres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>Our slow progress will enable him to divine our purposes and take his measures accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>The probability is, from the best information we possess, that the enemy has improved the roads leading to his lines of defence, while we have to work as we advance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>Bearing in mind what has been said, and the present unprecedented and impassable condition of the roads, it will be evident that no precise period can be fixed upon for the movement on this line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>Nor can its duration be closely calculated; it seems certain that many weeks may elapse before it is possible to commence the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>Assuming the success of this operation, and the defeat of the enemy as certain, the question at once arises as to the importance of the results gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>I think these results would be confined to the possession of the field of battle, the evacuation of the line of the upper Potomac by the enemy, and the moral effect of the victory &mdash; important results, it is true, but not decisive of the war, nor securing the destruction of the enemy's main army, for he could fall back upon other positions and fight us again and again, should the condition of his troops permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>If he is in no condition to fight us again out of the range of the entrenchments at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, we would find it a very difficult and tedious matter to follow him up there, for he would destroy his railroad bridges and otherwise impede our progress <pb id="p.234" n="234"/>through a region where the roads are as bad as they well can be, and we would probably find ourselves forced at last to change the whole theatre of war, or to seek a shorter land route to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, with a smaller available force and at an expenditure of much more time, than were we to adopt the short line at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>We would also have forced the enemy to concentrate his forces and perfect his defensive measures at the very points where it is desirable to strike him when least prepared.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>This movement, if successful, gives us the capital, the communications, the supplies of the rebels; <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> would fall; all the waters of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> would be ours; all <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be in our power, and the enemy forced to abandon <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>To reach whatever point may be selected as a base, a large amount of cheap water transportation must be collected, consisting mainly of canal-boats, barges, mood-boats, schooners, etc., towed by small steamers, all of a very different character from those required for all previous expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>This can certainly be accomplished within <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> from the time the order is given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>I propose, as the best possible plan that can, in my judgment, be adopted, to select <placeName reg="Urbanna, Middlesex, Virginia" key="tgn,2114705">Urbana</placeName> as a landing-place for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> detachments; to transport by water <num value="4">four</num> divisions of infantry with their batteries, the regular infantry, a fern wagons, <num value="1">one</num> bridge-train, and a few squadrons of cavalry, making the vicinity of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0102.0013.00235.01474" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,J.,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s position the place of embarkation for as many as possible; to move the regular cavalry and <orgName n="Reserve Artillery" type="artillery">reserve artillery</orgName>, the remaining bridge-trains and wagons, to a point somewhere near <placeName reg="Cape Lookout, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2220499">Cape Lookout</placeName>, then ferry them over the river by means of <name>North</name> river ferry-boats, march them over to the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> (covering the movement by an infantry force near <placeName key="tgn,2112200" n="1.000 3" reg="heathsville, northumberland, virginia">Heathsville</placeName>), and <pb id="p.236" n="236"/>to cross the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> in a similar way. The expense and difficulty of the movement will then be very much diminished (a saving of transportation of about <num value="10000">10,000</num> horses) and the result none the less certain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>The concentration of the cavalry, etc., on the lower counties of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> can be effected without exciting suspicion, and the movement made without delay from that cause.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>I fully realize that in all projects offered time will probably be the most valuable consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>It is my decided opinion that, in that point of view, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> plan should be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>It is possible, nay, highly probable, that the weather and state of the roads may be such as to delay the direct movement from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, with its unsatisfactory results and great risks, far beyond the time required to complete the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case we can fix no definite time for an advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>On the other line I regard success as certain by all the chances of war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>My judgment, as a general, is clearly in favor of this project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>Nothing is certain in war, but all the chances are in favor of this movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>This was but a single instance among many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>In fact, it may be broadly stated that we had no military maps of any value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>The line in front of us is therefore <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest ever opposed to an invading force in any country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>You will, then, ask why I advocated such a line for our operations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>My reasons are few but, I think, good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/>With proper assistance from the navy we could take <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, and then with gunboats on both rivers we could beat any force opposed to us on <placeName reg="Warwick, Accomack, Virginia" key="tgn,1131642">Warwick river</placeName>, because the shot and shell <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>from the gunboats would nearly overlap across the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>; so that if the enemy should retreat &mdash; and retreat he must &mdash; he would have a long way to go without rail or steam transportation, and every soul of his army must fall into our hands or be destroyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/>Another reason for my supporting the new base and plan was that this line, it was expected, would furnish water-transportation nearly to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>Now, supposing we succeed in breaking through the line in front of us, what can we do next?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3700"/>The roads are very bad, and if the enemy retains command of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and we do not <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reduce <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, it would be impossible for us to subsist this army <num value="3">three</num> marches beyond where it is now. As the roads are at present, it is with the utmost difficulty that we can subsist it in the position it now occupies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3701"/>You will see, therefore, by what I have said, that the force originally intended for the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> should be all sent forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3702"/>If I thought the <num value="4">four</num> <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> necessary when I supposed the navy would co-operate, and when I judged of the obstacles to be encountered by what I learned from maps and the opinions of officers long stationed at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>, and from all other sources, how much more should I think the full complement of troops requisite now that the navy cannot co-operate, and now that the strength of the enemy's lines and the number of his guns and men prove to be almost immeasurably greater than I had been led to expect!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>The line in front of us, in the opinion of all the military men here who are at all competent to judge, is <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest in the world, and the force of the enemy capable of being increased beyond the numbers we now have to oppose to him. Independently of the strength of the lines in front of us, and of the force of the enemy behind them, we cannot advance until we get command of either <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York river</placeName> or <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>The efficient co-operation of the navy is, therefore, absolutely essential, and so I considered it when I voted to change our base from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3705"/>An iron-clad boat must attack <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>; and if several strong gunboats could be sent up <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> also, our success will be certain and complete, and the rebellion will soon be put down.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>On the other hand, we must butt against the enemy's works with <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> and a great waste of time, life, and material.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3707"/>If we break through and advance, both our flanks will be assailed from <num value="2">two</num> great water-courses in the hands of the enemy; our supplies would give out, and the enemy, equal, if not superior, in numbers, would, with the other advantages, beat and destroy this army.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3883"/>I ever regarded it as an improper <num value="1">one</num>; my wish was to adopt a new line, based upon the waters of the lower <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3884"/>I always expected to meet with strong opposition on this line, the strongest that the rebels could offer, but I was well aware that upon overcoming this opposition the result would be decisive and pregnant with great results.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3886"/>When the movement was commenced I counted upon an active and disposable force of nearly <num value="150000">150,000</num> men, and intended to throw a strong column upon <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> either by <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York river</placeName> or, if that proved impracticable, by a march from the mouth of the <placeName reg="Severn River, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2653612">Severn</placeName>, expecting to turn in that manner all the defences of the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3889"/>Upon reaching <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> I learned that the rebels were being rapidly reinforced from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3893"/>While my men were under fire I learned that the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName> was removed from my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3894"/>No warning had been given me of this, nor was any <pb id="p.283" n="283"/>reason then assigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>I should also have mentioned that the evening before I left <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> I received a telegraphic despatch from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> informing me that the order placing <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> and its dependent troops under my command was rescinded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>No reason was given for this, nor has it been to this day. I confess that I have no right to know the reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/>This order deprived me of the support of another division which I had been authorized to form for active operations from among the troops near <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>Thus when I came under fire I found myself weaker by <num value="5">five</num> divisions than I had expected when the movement commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3974"/>Perhaps the point has been made clear enough, but at the risk of repetition I will say something more on the subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3975"/>Before starting from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> the best information in our possession clearly indicated that the <placeName reg="Warwick, Accomack, Virginia" key="tgn,1131642">Warwick river</placeName> ran nearly parallel with the <rs>James</rs>, instead of heading at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, and it seemed certain that the road from <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> to <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> did not cross that stream, at least any important branch of it, and that it presented no obstacle to an advance.

Now, let it be observed that at all points (on the right, centre, and left) we found the enemy's works fully garrisoned and provided with artillery, and that <persName n="Keyes,,,,," id="n0102.0016.00289.01869" reg="mostcommon:Keyes,E.,D.,,:4"><surname>Keyes</surname></persName> and his general officers reported that they found the position in their front so strong and so well provided with troops and artillery that it was impossible to assault with any hope of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3977"/>The same state of things was clearly the case in front of the right column, where I was. Now, it is very certain that the only thing to be done was to make close reconnoissancess of the enemy's position, in order to discover a vulnerable point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3978"/>This course was followed, and the unanimous opinion of all was that certain preliminary siege operations were necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/>I assert without fear of contradiction that no <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend="italics">at that time</hi> thought an assault possible; moreover, that when we saw the works abandoned by the enemy <hi rend="italics">it</hi> remained the conviction of all that, with the raw troops we had, an assault would have resulted in simply an useless butchery with no hope of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3981"/>The only fault to be found with the operations at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> is in regard to the slowness with which some of the engineer officers operated.

The time you proposed to proceed with me had elapsed, and particularly the difficulties of my leaving my vessel owing to the want of officers of experience to take care of her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>I have explained in my note of to-day, and have repeated to <persName n="Key,Colonel,,,," id="n0102.0017.00291.01873" reg="mostcommon:Key,Thomas,M.,,:3"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Key</surname></persName>, the greatly increased strength of the fortifications as seen from this position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>The forts at <placeName reg="Gloucester, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111950">Gloucester</placeName> are very formidable indeed, and the <orgName n="Water Battery" type="battery">water-batteries of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName></orgName> have evidently been increased in dimensions within a few days, as indicated by the new earth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>As I pointed out to you in our interview, the works to be most apprehended (though they all are too formidable for our vessels, or <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times their numbers and class) are the guns in mask about <num value="1">one</num>-quarter to <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of a mile this side of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, which position I point out to <persName n="Key,Colonel,,,," id="n0102.0017.00291.01874" reg="mostcommon:Key,Thomas,M.,,:3"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Key</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>All the gunboats of the navy would fail to take it, but would be destroyed in the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3993"/>Yet I will not hesitate to try the experiment, if required to do so, with this force, however inadequate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3995"/>With those <num value="2">two</num> batteries carried, this force might approach near enough to shell <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> at long range, but nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4653"/>This loading the artillery was the great cause of delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>Getting the carriages on to the transports was a tedious and exasperatingly slow process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5058"/>It was subject to frequent, sudden, and great variations in the volume of water, and a single violent rain-storm of brief duration would cause a rise of water which overflowed the bottomlands on both sides, and for many days made the river absolutely impassable without bridges.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5059"/>When our light troops approached the river on the <dateStruct value="-05-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> it was found that all the bridges had been destroyed by the enemy on our approach, except that at <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, and it became necessary not only to rebuild the old bridges, but also to construct several additional ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5061"/>We were thus obliged to select other less exposed points for our crossings.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5064"/>When we arrived opposite Bottom's bridge on the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> the enemy was there in only small force, and, as it was of the utmost importance to secure a lodgment on the right bank before he could concentrate his forces and resist the passage of the stream, I ordered <orgName n="division"><persName n="Casey,,,,," id="n0102.0022.00363.02543" reg="mostcommon:Casey,S.,,,:1"><surname>Casey</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 4">4th corps</orgName> to ford the river at once and occupy the heights on the further bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5069"/>All the information obtained from negroes, deserters, prisoners, and spies indicated that the enemy occupied in force all the approaches to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from the east, and that he intended to dispute every step of our advance beyond the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> on our left, and to resist the passage of the stream opposite our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5070"/>That their army was superior to ours in numbers seemed certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5071"/>Strong entrenchments had been constructed around the city, Up to this time I had every reason to expect that <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0102.0022.00363.02546" reg="nearbymention:McDowell,Irwin,,,"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> would commence his march from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--26"><day reg="26">26th</day></dateStruct>, and it was only during the evening of the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num> that I received from the <rs>President</rs> the telegram, already given, announcing the suspension of his movement.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5072"/>So far, then, as immediate operations were concerned, it only remained for me to make the best use of the forces at my disposal, and to avail myself of all possible artificial auxiliaries, to compensate as far as possible for the inadequacy of numbers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5074"/>In view of the peculiar character of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and the liability to sudden inundations, it became necessary to construct <num value="11">eleven</num> bridges, all long and difficult, with extensive logway approaches, and often built under fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5075"/>It will be remembered that the order for the co-operation of <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0102.0022.00364.02547" reg="nearbymention:McDowell,Irwin,,,"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> was only suspended, not revoked; and, therefore, I could not abandon the northern approach and my communications with <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5076"/>To cover these communications, and be prepared to effect the junction with the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">1st corps</orgName> when it advanced it was necessary to retain a portion of the army on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName>, and I could not make any serious movement with the forces on the right bank until the communications between the <num value="2">two</num> parts of the army were firmly and securely established by strong and sufficiently numerous bridges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5077"/>As the entrenchments around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were strong and heavily garrisoned, it would have been an act of madness and folly had I temporarily abandoned my communications and thrown the entire army across the stream, trusting to the chances of carrying the place by assault before the troops had exhausted the supplies carried with them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5078"/>I was not responsible for the fact that I was obliged to select a faulty and dangerous plan as the least objectionable of those from which I could choose.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5082"/>I thanked him for his gallantry, and asked what I could do for him. He replied very modestly that he had nothing to ask, and evidently did not suppose that he had done anything to deserve extraordinary reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5083"/>I then asked if he would like to serve on my personal staff as an aide-de-camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/>Upon this he brightened up and assured me that he would regard such service as the most gratifying he could perform; and I at once gave the necessary orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>I became much attached to him. In the later days of the war, when he commanded cavalry troops, he displayed a degree of prudence and good sense, in conducting the most dangerous expeditions, that surprised many who thought they knew him well.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>Those who accused him of reckless rashness would, perhaps, have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to accuse him of timidity if he had not attacked, and thus allowed the enemy to escape unhurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5368"/>The bridges became totally useless after this corps had passed, and others on a more permanent plan were commenced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5369"/>On my way to headquarters, after the <rs n="Battle of Fair Oaks" type="battle">battle of Fair Oaks</rs>, I attempted to cross the bridge where <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n0102.0023.00384.02834" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Edwin,V.,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> had taken over his corps on the day previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5371"/>I found the approach from the right bank for some <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> submerged to the depth of several feet, and, on reaching the place where the bridge had been, I found a great part of it carried away, so that I could not get my horse over, and was obliged to send him to Bottom's bridge, <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> below, as the only practicable crossing.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5373"/>These batteries were supported by strong forces of the enemy, having numerous rifle-pits in their front, which would have made it necessary, even had the approaches been in the best possible condition, to have fought a sanguinary battle, with but little prospect of success, before a passage could have been secured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5374"/>The only available means, therefore, of uniting our forces at <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fair Oaks</placeName> for an advance on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> soon after the battle was to march the troops from <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName> and other points on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName> down to Bottom's bridge, and thence over the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road to the position near <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fair Oaks</placeName>, a distance of about <measure n="23miles" type="distance">twenty-three miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5375"/>In short, the idea of uniting the <num value="2">two</num> wings of the army in time to make a vigorous pursuit of the enemy, with the prospect of overtaking him before he reached <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, only <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles distant</measure> from the field of battle, is simply absurd, and was, I presume, never for a moment seriously entertained by any <num value="1">one</num> connected with the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5376"/>An advance involving the separation of the <num value="2">two</num> wings by the impassable <rs>Chickahominy</rs> would have exposed each to defeat in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5702"/>I think that they see it in that light, and that they are fully prepared to make a desperate resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5703"/>I shall make the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle mainly an artillery combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5704"/>As soon as I gain possession of the <quote><placeName reg="Old Tavern, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2113497">Old Tavern</placeName></quote> I will push them in upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and behind their works; then I will bring up my heavy guns, shell the city, and carry it by assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5705"/>I speak very confidently, but if you could see the faces of the troops as I ride among them you would share my confidence.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5917"/>The operations of this day proved the numerical superiority of the enemy, and made it evident that while he had a large army on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName>, which had already turned our right and was in position to intercept the communications with our depot at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, he was also in large force between our army and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5918"/>I therefore effected a junction of our forces.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5919"/>This might probably have been executed on either side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and if the concentration had been effected on the left bank it is possible we might, with our entire force, have defeated the enemy there; but at that time they held the roads leading to the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, so that it would have been impossible to have sent forward supply-trains in advance of the army in that direction, and the guarding of those trains would have seriously embarrassed our operations in the battle we would have been compelled to fight, if concentrated on that bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5920"/>Moreover, we would at once have been followed by the enemy's forces upon the <rs>Richmond</rs> side of the river operating upon our rear; and if, in the chances of war, we had been ourselves defeated in the effort, we would have been forced to fall back to the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, and probably to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>; and, as both our flanks and rear would then have been entirely exposed, our entire supply-train, if not the greater part of the army itself, might have been lost.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5921"/>The movements of the enemy showed that they expected this, and, as they themselves acknowledged, they were prepared to cut off our retreat in that direction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6920"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>: You have been fully informed that the rebel army is in the front, with the purpose of overwhelming us by attacking our positions or reducing us by blocking our river communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6921"/>I cannot but regard our condition as critical, and I earnestly desire, in view of possible contingencies, to lay before your excellency, for your private consideration, my general views concerning the existing state of the rebellion, although they do not strictly relate to the situation of this army or strictly come within the scope of my official duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6922"/>These views amount to convictions, and are deeply impressed upon my mind and heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6923"/>Our cause must never be abandoned; it is the cause of free institutions and self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6924"/>The Constitution and the <rs>Union</rs> must be preserved, whatever may be the cost in time, treasure, and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6925"/>If secession is successful other dissolutions are clearly to be seen in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6926"/>Let neither military disaster, political faction, nor foreign war shake your settled purpose to enforce the equal operation of the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> upon the people of every State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6927"/>The time has come when the government must determine <pb id="p.488" n="488"/>upon a civil and military policy covering the whole ground of our national trouble.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6928"/>The responsibility of determining, declaring, and supporting such civil and military policy, and of directing the whole course of national affairs in regard to the rebellion, must now be assumed and exercised by you, or our cause will be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6929"/>The Constitution gives you power sufficient even for the present terrible exigency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6930"/>This rebellion has assumed the character of war; as such it should be regarded, and it should be conducted upon the highest principles known to <name>Christian</name> civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6931"/>It should not be a war looking to the subjugation of the people of any State in any event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6932"/>It should not be at all a war upon population, but against armed forces and political organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6933"/>Neither confiscation of property, political executions of persons, territorial organization of States, or forcible abolition of slavery should be contemplated for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6934"/>In prosecuting the war all private property and unarmed persons should be strictly protected, subject only to the necessity of military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6935"/>All private property taken for military use should be paid or receipted for; pillage and waste should be treated as high crimes; all unnecessary trespass sternly prohibited, and offensive demeanor by the military towards citizens promptly rebuked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6936"/>Military arrests should not be tolerated, except in places where active hostilities exist, and oaths not required by enactments constitutionally made should be neither demanded nor received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6937"/>Military government should be confined to the preservation of public order and the protection of political rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6938"/>Military power should not be allowed to interfere with the relations of servitude, either by supporting or impairing the authority of the master, except for repressing disorder, as in other cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6939"/>Slaves contraband under the act of Congress, seeking military protection, should receive it. The right of the government to appropriate permanently to its own service claims to slave labor should be asserted, and the right of the owner to compensation therefor should be recognized.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6940"/>This principle might be extended, upon grounds of military necessity and security, to all the slaves within a particular State, thus working manumission in such State; and in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, perhaps in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> also, and possibly even in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, the expediency of such a measure is only a question of time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6941"/>A system of policy thus constitutional and conservative, and pervaded by the influences of Christianity and freedom, would receive the support of almost all truly loyal men, would deeply impress the rebel masses and all foreign nations, and it might be humbly hoped that it would commend itself to the favor of the <name>Almighty</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6942"/>Unless the principles governing the future conduct of our struggle shall be made known and approved, the effort to obtain requisite forces will be almost hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6943"/>A declaration of radical <pb id="p.489" n="489"/>views, especially upon slavery, will rapidly disintegrate our present armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6944"/>The policy of the government must be supported by concentrations of military power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6945"/>The national forces should not be dispersed in expeditions, posts of occupation, and numerous armies, but should be mainly collected into masses and brought to bear upon the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6946"/>Those armies thoroughly defeated, the political structure which they support would soon cease to exist.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7069"/>I must confess that it has caused me the greatest pain I ever experienced, for I am convinced that the order to withdraw this army to <placeName reg="Aquia Creek, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1132269">Acquia creek</placeName> will prove disastrous to our cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7070"/>I fear it will be a fatal blow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7071"/>Several days are necessary to complete the preparations for so important a movement as this; and while they are in progress I beg that careful consideration may be given to my statements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7072"/>This army is now in excellent discipline and condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7073"/>We hold a debouch on both banks of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, so that we are free to act in any direction, and, with the assistance of the gunboats, I consider our communications as now secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7074"/>We are <placeName><distance reg="25miles">twenty-five miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, and are not likely to meet the enemy in force sufficient to fight a battle until we have marched <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <measure n="18miles" type="distance">eighteen miles</measure>, which brings us practically within <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7075"/>Our longest line of land-transportation would be from this point <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure>; but with the aid of the gunboats we can supply the army by water, during its advance, certainly to within <placeName><distance reg="12miles">twelve miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7077"/>From here to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> is a march of about <measure n="70miles" type="distance">seventy miles</measure>; for I regard it as impracticable to withdraw this army and its material except by land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7078"/>The result of the movement would thus be a march of <measure n="145miles" type="distance">one hundred and forty-five miles</measure> to reach a point now only <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles distant</measure>, and to deprive ourselves entirely of the powerful aid of the gunboats and water-transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7079"/>Add to this the certain demoralization of this army which would ensue, the terribly depressing effect upon the people of the <rs>North</rs>, and the strong probability that it would influence foreign powers to recognize our adversaries, and there appear to me sufficient reasons to make it my imperative duty to urge, in the strongest terms afforded by our language, that this order may be rescinded, and that, far from recalling this army, it be promptly reinforced to enable it to resume the offensive.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7080"/>It may be said that there are no reinforcements available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8972"/>As I mentioned to you before, our army has been very much reduced by casualties in the recent battles, and in my judgment all the reinforcements of old troops that can possibly be dispensed with around <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and other places should be instantly pushed forward by rail to this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8981"/>All the information in my possession goes to prove that the main body of the enemy is concentrated not far from <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName>, with some troops at <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>; not many in <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8982"/>Their movements of late have been an extension towards our right and beyond it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8983"/>This army is not now in condition to undertake another campaign nor to bring on another battle, unless great advantages are offered by some mistake of the enemy, or pressing military exigencies render it necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8984"/>We are greatly deficient in officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8985"/>Many of the old regiments are reduced to mere skeletons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8986"/>The new regiments need instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8987"/>Not a day should be lost in filling the old regiments &mdash; our main dependence &mdash; and in supplying vacancies among the officers by promotion.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8988"/>My present purpose is to hold the army about as it is now, rendering <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> secure and watching the river closely, intending to attack the enemy should he attempt to cross to this side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8989"/>Our possession of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> gives us the great advantage of a secure debouch, but we cannot avail ourselves of it until the railroad bridge is finished, because we cannot otherwise supply a greater number of troops than we now have on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8990"/>When the river rises so that the enemy cannot cross in force, I purpose concentrating the army somewhere near <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, and then acting according to circumstances &mdash; viz., moving on <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, if from the position and attitude of the enemy we are likely to gain a great advantage by doing so, or else devoting a reasonable time to the organization of the army and instruction of the new troops, preparatory to an advance on whatever line may be determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8991"/>In any event I regard it as absolutely necessary to send new regiments at once to the old corps, for purposes of instruction, and that the old regiments be filled at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8992"/>I have no fears as to an attack on <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> by the line of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8994"/>I rather apprehend a renewal of the attempt in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, should the river remain low for a great length of time, and should they receive considerable addition to their force.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9177"/>Cavalry may be said to constitute the antennae of an army.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9180"/>To persons not familiar with the movements of troops, and the amount of transportation required for a large army marching away from water or railroad communications, the number of animals mentioned by the general-in-chief may have appeared unnecessarily large; but to a military man who takes the trouble to enter into an accurate and detailed computation of the number of pounds of subsistence and forage required for such an army as that of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, it will be seen that the <num value="31000">31,000</num> animals were considerably less than was absolutely necessary to an advance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9188"/>It will be observed that this estimate does not embrace the animals necessary to transport quartermasters' supplies, baggage, camp equipage, ambulances, reserve ammunition, forage for officers' horses, etc., which would greatly augment the necessary transportation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9189"/>It may very truly be said that we did make the march with the means at our disposal; but it will be remembered that we met with no serious opposition from the enemy, neither did we encounter delays from any other cause.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9213"/>The cavalry requirements, without which an advance would have been in the highest degree injudicious and unsafe, were still wanting.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9215"/>It was manifest that we should find it, as we subsequently did, a hostile district, where we could derive no aid from the inhabitants that would justify dispensing with the active co-operation of an efficient cavalry force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9216"/>Accordingly I fixed upon the <dateStruct value="-11-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> as the earliest date at which the forward movement could well be commenced.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9217"/>The <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, in a letter to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> on the <dateStruct value="-10-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="10">Oct.</month></dateStruct>, says: <quote>In my opinion there has been no such want of supplies in the army under <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0102.0048.00641.05235" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> as to prevent his compliance with the orders to advance against the enemy.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9218"/>Notwithstanding this opinion, expressed by such high authority, I am compelled to say again that the delay in the reception of necessary supplies up to that date had left the army in a condition totally unfit to advance against the enemy; that an advance under the existing circumstances would, in my judgment, have been attended with the highest degree of peril, with great suffering and sickness among the men, and with imminent danger of being cut off from our supplies by the superior cavalry force of the enemy, and with no reasonable prospect of gaining any advantage over him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9219"/>I dismiss this subject with the remark that I have found it impossible to resist the force of my own convictions that the commander of an army who, from the time of its organization, has for <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> been in constant communication with its officers and men, the greater part of the time engaged in active <pb id="p.642" n="642"/>service in the field, and who has exercised this command in many battles, must certainly be considered competent to determine whether his army is in proper condition to advance on the enemy or not; and he must necessarily possess greater facilities for forming a correct judgment in regard to the wants of his men and the condition of his supplies than the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> in his office at <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9221"/>It was undertaken at a time when our army had experienced severe defeats, and its object was to preserve the national capital and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, to protect <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> from invasion, and to drive the enemy out of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9224"/>At the time of the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs> the <rs>Potomac</rs> was very low, and presented a comparatively weak line of defence unless watched by large masses of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9225"/>The reoccupation of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> and the disposition of troops above that point rendered the line of the <rs>Potomac</rs> secure against everything except cavalry raids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9238"/>At the period in question the <rs>Potomac</rs> was still very low, and I apprehended that if I crossed the river below <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> the enemy would promptly check the movement by recrossing into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, at the same time covering his rear by occupying in strong force the passes leading through the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> from the southeast into the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9239"/>I anticipated, as the result of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> course, that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0102.0048.00643.05236" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,:3"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> would fight me near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, if he could do so under favorable circumstances; or else that he would abandon the lower <rs>Shenandoah</rs>, and leave the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> free to act upon some other line of operations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9244"/>Under these circumstances <pb id="p.644" n="644"/>I felt at liberty to disregard the possibility of the enemy's, recrossing the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and determined to select the line east of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, feeling convinced that it would secure me the largest accession of force and the most cordial support of the <rs>President</rs>, whose views from the beginning were in favor of that line.</p>
