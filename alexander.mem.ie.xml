<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>Accordingly, I advanced rapidly in line of battle through the dense woods, intersected by ravines, occasionally thick brier patches, and other obstructions, guided only by the enemy's fire in keeping direction, frequently retarded and sometimes broken, by troops in front of me, until the command reached the open field on the elevated plateau immediately in front of, and in short range of, the enemy's guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>Here, coming up with a portion of the troops which I was ordered to support, I halted my line for the purpose of rectifying it and of allowing many of the troops whom I was to support, to pass me and form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>These objects were but imperfectly accomplished by me, as well as by the rest of the troops within my view, from the great confusion and disorder in the field &mdash; arising much from the difficulties of the ground over which they had to pass, and in part from the heavy fire of grape and canister and shells, which the enemy's batteries were pouring in upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>But, having accomplished what could be done of this work, I ordered my brigade to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>It moved forward steadily and firmly until it came up with the troops in advance, who had halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>I then ordered it to halt, and ordered the men to lie down, which they did, and received the enemy's fire for a considerable time, when an order was repeated along my line, coming from the left, directing the line to oblique to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>This order I immediately and promptly countermanded as soon as it reached the part of the line where I stood, and arrested it in part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>I saw that the immediate effect of the movement was to throw the troops into the woods and ravines on the left of the plateau, and necessarily throw them into great confusion. . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5245"/>A pause of <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> after the <rs n="Battle of Chancellorsville" type="battle">battle of Chancellorsville</rs> to prepare for an aggressive counter-stroke, was, perhaps, the period of highest tide in <hi rend="italics">Confederate hopes</hi> among all the vicissitudes of the war. The campaign which ensued, culminating at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, is generally accepted as the turning-point of Confederate fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>I think it may be held that each summer campaign in Va. marked a Confederate crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>That is to say, that defeat in any <num value="1">one</num> of them would have been followed by the collapse of its government, within less than another <measure n="12months" type="date">12 months</measure>, while a victory would assure it only of that much of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/>More than that was impossible as long as the war spirit ruled the <rs>North</rs>, and this was certainly the case in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/>A year later, however, there did come a period of very great Federal discouragement, due to a succession of severe losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>At the same time, there occurred a crisis in the military situation, which threatened an ignominious termination to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0130.0016.00363.05839" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:6"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s campaign, the greatest campaign of the war. This was saved by a brilliant piece of Federal strategy, which is to be told of in due course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5251"/>In it will be found the real crisis &mdash; the story of the passing of the last hope of Confederate success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>It was not <pb id="p.364" n="364"/> lost upon any field of battle, either of offence or of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>It was a victory of strategy and not <num value="1">one</num> of arms.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>The defensive was to invite the enemy to accumulate his resources to the point at which their very weight would crush us. But, for a brief period, we enjoyed a choice of the field of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5256"/>It was a fatal mistake that in this choice we failed to utilize the single advantage in the game of war, which the <rs>Confederacy</rs> enjoyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5257"/>We occupied the <q direct="unspecified">Interior Lines,</q> and could reinforce from <num value="1">one</num> flank to the other, across our country, more quickly than the enemy could discover and follow our movements by roundabout routes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5258"/>Only by such transfers of her armies could the <rs>South</rs> ever hope to face her adversaries with superior, or even with equal, numbers&mdash; by demanding double duty of her regiments, fighting battles with them alternately in the east and in the west.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5600"/>The enemy's line, though taken hurriedly upon the natural ridges overlooking the open country, which nearly surrounded it, was unique both in character and strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5602"/>Their lines were the interior and shorter, being scarcely <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> in length, giving ability to reenforce at any point by short cuts across the interior area.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5603"/>Our exterior lines were about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> in length, and to move from point to point required long, roundabout marches, often exposed to the enemy's view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5607"/>Their left, which was the top of the fish-hook shank, rested on Big and <placeName reg="Little Round Top mountains">Little Round Top mountains</placeName>; and their right, which was the <q direct="unspecified">point</q> of the <q direct="unspecified">fish-hook,</q> was on <placeName reg="Culps Hill, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2271366">Culp's Hill</placeName> over <placeName key="tgn,2623544" n="1.000 1" reg="rock creek, menard, illinois">Rock Creek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5608"/>Both flanks presented precipitous and rocky fronts, screened from artillery fire by forest growth, and the convexity of the line was such that the <num value="2">two</num> flanks approached and each was able to reinforce the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6042"/>Enfilading fire is so effective that no troops can submit to it long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6043"/>Illustrations of this fact were not wanting in the events of this day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6051"/>That this was not realized at the time is doubtless partly due to the scarcity of trained staff and reconnoitring officers, and partly to the fact that <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n0130.0018.00417.06941" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName> had discontinued and withdrawn the pursuit on the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">1st</day></dateStruct>, when it was about to <pb id="p.418" n="418"/> undertake this position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8143"/>The bulk of the earth, however, fell immediately around the crater, mingled with the debris of <num value="2">2</num> guns, <num value="22">22</num> cannoneers, and perhaps <num value="250">250</num> infantry (<num value="9">nine</num> companies of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="SC22">22d S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8149"/>But, considering the surprise, the novelty of the occasion and the terrific cannonade by <num value="150">150</num> guns and mortars which was opened immediately, the coolness and self-possession of the entire brigade was remarkable, and to it is to be attributed the success of the defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8153"/>The multiplicity of the deep and narrow trenches, and the bomb-proofs in the rear of our lines, doubtless contributed to our success in doing this on the flanks, but there was also decided lack of vigor and enterprise on the part of the enemy, which permitted us to form barricades, which were successfully defended to the last.</p>
