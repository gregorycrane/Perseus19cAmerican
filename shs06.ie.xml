<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Rations in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> were alternately superabundant and altogether wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The quality, quantity and frequency of them depended upon the amount of stores in the hands of the commissaries, the relative positions of the troops and the wagon trains, and the many accidents and mishaps of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>During the latter years and months of the war, so uncertain was the issue as to time, quantity and composition, the men became in large measure independent of this seeming absolute necessity, and by some mysterious means, known only to purely patriotic soldiers, learned to fight without pay and find a subsistence in the field, the stream or the forest, and, on the bleak mountain side, a shelter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Sometimes there was an abundant issue of bread and no meat; then meat in any quantity and no flour or meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Sugar in abundance and no coffee to be had for <quote>love or money,</quote> and then coffee plenteously without a grain of sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>For months nothing but flour for bread and then nothing but meal, till all hands longed for a biscuit, or fresh meat until it was nauseating; and then salt-pork without intermission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>To be <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> day without anything to eat was common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="2">Two</num></hi> days fasting, marching and fighting was not <hi rend="italics">un</hi>common, and there were times when no rations were issued for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>. On <num value="1">one</num> march, from <placeName>Petersburg</placeName> to <placeName>Appomattox</placeName>, no rations were issued to <persName n="Cutshaw,,,,," id="n0119.0002.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Cutshaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Cutshaw</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="battalion of artillery">battalion of artillery</orgName> for <num value="1">one</num> entire week, and the men subsisted on the corn intended for the battery horses, raw bacon <pb id="p.2" n="2"/>captured from the enemy, and the water of springs, creeks and rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>No doubt there were other commands suffering the same privations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>A soldier in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> was fortunate when he had his flour, meat, sugar and coffee all at the same time and in proper quantity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Having these, the most skillful axeman of the mess hewed down a fine hickory or oak, and cut it into <quote>lengths.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>All hands helped to <quote>tote it</quote> to the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>When the wood was convenient, the fire was large and the red coals abundant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The man most gifted in the use of the skillet was the <num value="1">one</num> most highly appreciated about the fire, and as tyrannical as a Turk; but when he raised the lid of the oven and exposed the brown, crusted tops of the biscuit, animosity subsided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The frying pan, full of <quote>grease,</quote> then became the centre of attraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>As the hollow-cheeked boy <quote>sopped</quote> his biscuit, his poor, pinched countenance wrinkled into a smile and his sunken eyes glistened with delight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The strong men squatted around, chuckling over their good luck and <quote>cooing</quote> --like a child with a big piece of cake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Ah! this was a sight which but few of those who live and die are ever permitted to see.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>And the coffee, too &mdash; how delicious the aroma of it, and how readily each man disposes of a quart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>And now the last biscuit is gone, the last drop of coffee, and the frying pan is <quote>wiped</quote> clean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The tobacco bag is pulled wide open,, pipes are scraped, knocked out and filled, the red coal is applied, and the blue smoke rises in wreaths and curls from the mouths of the no longer hungry, but happy and contented soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Songs rise on the still night air, the merry laugh resounds, the woods are bright with the rising flame of the fire, story after story is told, song after song is sung, and at <time value="12am">midnight</time> the soldiers steal away <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> to their blankets on the ground and sleep till reveille.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Such was a meal when the mess was fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>How different when the wagons had not been heard from for <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>, and the remnants of stock on hand had to do. <hi rend="italics">Now</hi>, the question is, how to do the largest amount of good to the largest number with the smallest amount of material?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The most experienced men discuss the situation and decide that <quote>somebody</quote> must go foraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Though the stock on hand is small, no <num value="1">one</num> seems anxious to leave the small certainty and go in search of the large uncertainty of supper from some farmer's well filled table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But at <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>last several comrades start out, and as they disappear the preparations for immediate consumption commence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The meat is too little to cook alone, and the flour will scarcely make <num value="6">six</num> biscuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The result is that <quote>slosh</quote> or <quote>coosh</quote> must do. So the bacon is fried out till the pan is half full of boiling grease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The flour is mixed with water until it flows like milk, poured into the grease and rapidly stirred till the whole is a dirty brown mixture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is now ready to be served.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Perhaps some dainty fellow prefers the more imposing <quote>slap jack.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>If so, the flour is mixed with less water, the grease reduced, and the paste poured in till it covers the bottom of the pan, and, when brown on the underside, is by a nimble twist of the pan turned and browned again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If there is any sugar in camp it makes a delicious addition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>About the time the last scrap of <quote>slap jack</quote> and the last spoonful of <quote>slosh</quote> are disposed of, the unhappy foragers return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They take in the situation at a glance &mdash; realize with painful distinctness that they have sacrificed the homely slosh for the vain expectancy of applebutter, shortcake and milk, and, with woeful countenance and mournful voice, narrate their adventure and disappointment thus: <quote>Well, boys, we have done the best <hi rend="italics">we</hi> could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We have walked about <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure> over the mountain, and haven't found a <hi rend="italics">mouthful to eat</hi>. Sorry, but it's a fact.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><quote><persName n="Brown,,Billy,,," id="n0119.0002.00003.00005" reg="default:Brown,Billy,,,"><foreName>Billy</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> fell down the mountain and mashed his nose; Patso nearly scratched his eyes out with the briars, and we are all hungry as dogs &mdash; give us our biscuit.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Of course there are none, and, as it is not contrary to army etiquette to do so, the whole mess professes to be very sorry, and is greatly delighted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Sometimes, however, the foragers returned well laden with good things, and, as good comrades should, shared the fruits of their toilsome hunt with the whole mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Foragers thought it not indelicate to linger about the house of the unsuspecting farmer till the lamp revealed the family at supper, and then modestly approach and knock at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>An invitation to enter was almost certain to follow and was certainly accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The good hearted man knew that his guests were <quote>posted</quote> about the meal which was in progress in the next room, the invitation to supper was given, and, shall I say it, accepted with an unbecoming lack of reluctance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The following illustrates the ingenuity of the average forager: There was great scarcity of meat, and no prospect of a supply from the wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><num value="2">Two</num> experienced foragers were sent out, and as <pb id="p.4" n="4"/>a farmer about <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> from the camp was killing hogs, guided by soldier instinct, they went directly to his house, and found the meat nicely cut up, the various pieces of each hog making a separate pile on the floor of an outhouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The proposition to buy met with a surprisingly ready response on the part of the farmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He offered <num value="1">one</num> entire pile of meat, being <num value="1">one</num> whole hog, for such a small sum that the foragers instantly closed the bargain, and as promptly opened their eyes to the danger which menaced them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>They give the old gentleman a <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollar</measure> bill and request the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He is pleased with their honest method and hastens away to his house for the desired change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The <num value="2">two</num> honest foragers hastily examine the particular pile of pork which the simple hearted farmer has designated theirs, find it very rank and totally unfit for food, transfer half of it to another pile, from which they take half and add to theirs, and await the return of the farmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He returns, gives them their change and assures them they have a bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They agree that they have, toss the good and bad together into a bag, say good-bye, and depart as rapidly as artillerymen on foot can. The result of this trip was a <quote>pot-pie</quote> of large dimensions, and some <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> men gorged with fat pork, declaring that they had never cared and would never again wish to eat pork &mdash; especially pork-pies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>A large proportion of the eating of the army was done in the houses and at the tables of the people &mdash; not by the use of force, but by the wish and invitation of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It was at times necessary that whole towns should help to sustain the <orgName n="Army of Defense" type="army">army of defence</orgName>, and when this was the case, it was done voluntarily and cheerfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The soldiers &mdash; all who conducted themselves properly &mdash; were received as honored guests and given the best in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>There was a wonderful absence of stealing or plundering, and even when the people suffered from depredation they attributed the cause to terrible necessity rather than to wanton disregard of the rights of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>And when armed guards were placed over the smokehouses and barns, it was not so much because the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> doubted the honesty as that he knew the necessities of his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>But even pinching hunger was not held to be an excuse for marauding expeditions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The inability of the government to furnish supplies forced the men to depend largely upon their own energy and ingenuity to obtain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The officers knowing this, relaxed discipline to an extent which would seem, to an European officer for instance, ruinous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><pb id="p.5" n="5"/></p> 
<p>It was no uncommon sight to see a brigade or division, which was but a moment before marching in solid column along the road, scattered over an immense field searching for the luscious blackberries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>And it was wonderful to see how promptly and cheerfully all returned to the ranks when the field was gleaned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>In the fall of the year a persimmon tree on the roadside would halt a column and detain it till the last persimmon disappeared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The sutler's wagon, loaded with luxuries, which was so common in the <rs>Federal</rs> army, was unknown in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>; and for <num value="2">two</num> reasons, the men had no money to buy sutlers' stores and the country no men to spare for sutlers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The nearest approach to the sutler's wagon was the <quote>cider cart</quote> of some old darkey or a basket of pies and cakes displayed on the roadside for sale.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The Confederate soldier relied greatly upon the abundant supplies of eatables which the enemy was kind enough to bring him, and he cheerfully risked his life for the accomplishment of the <num value="2">two</num>-fold purpose of whipping the enemy and getting what he called <quote>a square meal.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>After a battle there was general feasting on the <rs>Confederate</rs> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Good things, scarcely ever seen at other times, filled the haversacks and the stomachs of <quote>Boys in gray.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Imagine the feelings of men half famished when they rush into a camp at <num value="1">one</num> side, while the enemy flees from the other, and find the coffee on the fire, sugar at hand ready to be dropped into the coffee, bread in the oven, crackers by the box, fine beef ready cooked, desiccated vegetables by the bushel, canned peaches, lobsters, tomatoes, milk, barrels of ground and toasted coffee, soda, salt, and in short everything a hungry soldier craves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Then add the liquors, wines, cigars and tobacco found in the tents of the officers and the wagons of the sutlers, and remembering the condition of the victorious party, hungry, thirsty and weary, say if it did not require wonderful devotion to duty and great self denial to push on, trampling under foot the plunder of the camp, and pursue the enemy till the sun went down.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>When it was allowable to halt, what a glorious time it was!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Men who a moment before would have been delighted with a pone of corn-bread and a piece of fat meat now discuss the comparative merits of peaches and milk and fresh tomatoes, lobster and roast beef, and forgetting the briar-root pipe, faithful companion of the vicissitudes of the soldier's life, snuff the aroma of imported Havanas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><pb id="p.6" n="6"/></p> 
<p>In sharp contrast with the mess-cooking at the big fire was the serious and diligent work of the man separated from his comrades, out of reach of the woods, but bent on cooking and eating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He has found a coal of fire, and having placed over it in an ingenious manner the few leaves and twigs near his post, he fans the little pile with his hat. It soon blazes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Fearing the utter consumption of his fuel, he hastens to balance on the little fire his tin cup of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>When it boils, from some secure place in his clothes, he takes a little coffee and drops it in the cup, and almost instantly the cup is removed and set aside; then the slice of fat meat is laid on the coals and when brown and crisp, completes the meal &mdash; for the <quote>crackers</quote> or biscuit are ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>No <num value="1">one</num> but a soldier would have undertaken to cook with such a fire, as frequently it was no bigger than a quart cup.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Crackers, or <quote>hard tack</quote> as they were called, are notoriously poor eating, but in the hands of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier were made to do good duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>When on the march and pressed for time, a piece of solid fat pork and a dry cracker was passable or luscious, as the time was long or short since the last meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>When there was leisure to do it, hard tack was soaked well and then fried in bacon grease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Prepared thus it was a dish which no Confederate had the weakness or the strength to refuse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Sorghum, in the absence of the better molasses of peace times, was greatly prized and eagerly sought after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>A <quote>Union</quote> man living near the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines was <num value="1">one</num> day busy boiling his crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Naturally enough, some of <quote>our boys</quote> smelt out the place and determined to have some of the sweet fluid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>They had found a yearling dead in the field hard by, and in thinking over the matter determined to sell the <rs>Union</rs> man if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>So they cut from the dead animal a choice piece of beef, carried it to the old fellow and offered to trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>He accepted the offer and the whole party walked off with canteens full.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Artillerymen, having tender consciences and no muskets, seldom, if ever, shot stray pigs; but they did sometimes, as an act of friendship, wholly disinterested, point out to the infantry a pig which seemed to need shooting, and by way of dividing the danger and responsibility of the act, accept privately a choice part of the deceased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when a civilian was dining with the mess, there was a fine pig for dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>This circumstance caused the civilian to remark on the good fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The <quote>forager</quote> remarked that <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>pig was an uncommon dish, this <num value="1">one</num> having been kicked by <num value="1">one</num> of the battery horses while stealing corn and instantly killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The civilian seemed to doubt the statement after his teeth had come down hard on a pistol bullet, and continued to doubt though assured that it was the head of a <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse-shoe</rs> nail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The most melancholy eating a soldier was ever forced to do, was when pinched with hunger, cold, wet and dejected, he wandered over the deserted field of battle and satisfied his cravings with the contents of the haversacks of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>If there is anything which will overcome the natural abhorrence which a man feels for the enemy, the loathing of the bloated dead and the awe engendered by the presence of death, solitude and silence, it is hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Impelled by its clamoring men of high principle and tenderest humanity, become for the time void of sensibility and condescend to acts which, though justified by their extremity, seem afterwards, even to the doers, too shameless to mention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>When rations became so very small that it was absolutely necessary to supplement them, and the camp was permanently established, those men who had the physical ability worked for the neighborhood farmers at cutting cord-wood, harvesting the crops, killing hogs or any other farm-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>A stout man would cut a cord of wood a day and receive <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> in money or its equivalent in something eatable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Hogs were slaughtered for the <quote><num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> quarter.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>When the corn became large enough to eat, the roasting ears, thrown in the ashes with the shucks on and nicely roasted, made a grateful meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Turnip and onion patches also furnished delightful and much-needed food, good, raw or cooked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Occasionally, when a mess was hard pushed for eatables, it became necessary to resort to some ingenious method of disgusting a part of the mess, that the others might eat their fill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The <quote>pepper treatment</quote> was a common method practiced with the soup, which once failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>A shrewd fellow who loved things <quote>hot</quote> decided to have plenty of soup, and to accomplish his purpose, as he passed and repassed the boiling pot, dropped in a pod of red pepper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>But, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>for him, there was another man like minded who adopted the same plan, and the result was the <quote>mess</quote> waited in vain for that pot of soup to cool.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The individual coffee boiler of <num value="1">one</num> man in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> was always kept at the boiling point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The owner of it was an enigma to his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>They could not understand his strange fondness for <quote>red-hot</quote> coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Since the war he has <pb id="p.8" n="8"/>explained that he found the heat of the coffee prevented its use by others and adopted the plan of placing his cup on the fire after every sip. This same character never troubled himself to carry a canteen, though a great water drinker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>When he found a good canteen he would kindly give it to a comrade, reserving the privilege of an occasional drink when in need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>He soon had an interest in <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> canteens and their contents, and a drink of water if it was to be found in any of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>He pursued the same plan with blankets and always had plenty in that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>His entire outfit was the clothes on his back and a haversack accurately shaped to hold <num value="0.5">one half</num> pone of corn bread.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Roasting-ear time was a trying time for the hungry privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Having been fed during the whole of the winter on salt-meat and coarse bread, his system craved the fresh, luscious juice of the corn, and at times his honesty gave way under the pressure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>How could he resist?--he didn't &mdash; he took some roasting ears!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Sometimes the farmer grumbled, sometimes he quarreled and sometimes he complained to the officers of the depredations of <quote>the men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The officers apologized, eat what corn they had on hand and sent their <quote>boy</quote> for some more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/><num value="1">One</num> old farmer conceived the happy plan of inviting some privates to his house, stating his grievances and securing their co-operation in the effort to protect his corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>He told them that of course <hi rend="italics">they</hi> were not the <hi rend="italics">gentlemen</hi> who took his corn!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Oh no!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>of course <hi rend="italics">they</hi> would not do such a thing; but wouldn't they please speak to the others and ask them please not to take his corn?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Of course I certainly!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>oh yes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>they would certainly remonstrate with their comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>How they burned though as they thought of the past and contemplated the near future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>As they returned to camp through the field they filled their haversacks with the silky ears, and were met on the other side of the field by the kind farmer and a file of men who were only too eager to secure the plucked corn <quote>in the line of duty.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>A faithful officer, worn out with the long, weary march, sick, hungry and dejected, leaned his back against a tree and groaned to think of his inability to join in the chase of an old hare, which, he knew from the wild yells in the wood, his men were pursuing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>But the uproar approached him &mdash; nearer, nearer and nearer until he saw the hare bounding towards him with a regiment at her heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>She spied an opening made by the folds of the officer's cloak and jumped in and he embraced his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meal for <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>. <pb id="p.9" n="9"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>An artilleryman was camped for a day where no water was to be had. During the night, awakened by thirst, he arose and stumbled about in search of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>To his surprise he found a large bucketful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>He drank deep and with delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>As the <rs>Federal</rs> reports always reckon the officers with the men, whenever a comparison is to be made between the forces of both armies it is the latter system which should be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>If that increase is difficult to appreciate, there is another element which can be easily calculated &mdash; it is the reunion of <num value="3">three</num> brigades which do not appear on the return for the <dateStruct value="-05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The marches of the army were in average neither excessive nor continuous; the weather was fine; the roads in good order; and I have the best authority to believe that <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Pettigrew,,,,," id="n0119.0003.00011.00022" reg="mostcommon:Pettigrew,J.,Johnston,,:1"><surname>Pettigrew</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, by example, which was less accustomed to hard marching than the rest of the army, reached Pensylvania with at least as many men present for duty as when it crossed the <rs>Rapidan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The difference is <num value="1305">1,305</num>, but that decrease must be ascribed altogether to the <num value="3">three</num> above mentioned causes, viz: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the detachment of <num value="3">three</num> regiments, left at or about <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, at least <num value="850">850</num>; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the loss in <rs n="Battle of Winchester" type="battle">battle at Winchester</rs>, <num value="162">162</num>; <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, therefore the reduction by sickness, straggling and desertion is only <num value="293">293</num>, unless the division should <pb id="p.12" n="12"/>have received individual accessions between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> and the <dateStruct value="-06-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>That difference I have shown to be for <orgName n="division"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0119.0003.00012.00026" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:11"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> <num value="293">293</num>, or less than <num value="0.04">four per cent.</num> The proportion for the whole army could not be quite as large, and therefore should not be reckoned at more than <num value="2600">2,600</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> error which I will examine is contained in the following passage: <quote>The total is the figure which is generally given in both armies where only <num value="1">one</num> is given, the number of men on detached <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>service being liable to vary greatly from day to day.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>By <quote>detached service,</quote> he evidently means <quote>extra or daily duty,</quote> which is a very different thing from detached service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>With this understanding as to his meaning, his remark, that the number of men on such duty varied greatly from day to day, does not apply to the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>At a very early day it had been found injudicious and unsafe to employ negroes as teamsters and laborers for the army when it was in an active campaign, and when the conscript act became a law, and all able-bodied white men were made liable to military duty, it of course became necessary to detail from the ranks all the teamsters and laboring men required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The number of these was very considerable, in order to furnish drivers for the baggage and supply trains, as well as such men as were required for manual labor in the several staff departments; and the details were permanent and of course not liable to vary from day to day. It was owing to this fact that the number of men reported on extra duty in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> greatly exceeded, in proportion to strength, that reported on extra or daily duty with the <rs>Federal</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>A fair opportunity was offered me, and the intended diversion was changed into an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>The troops sprang to their work and moved forward with all the steadiness and firmness that characterize war-worn veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The batteries, continuing their play upon the confused masses, completed the work of this portion of <pb id="p.62" n="62"/>the enemy's line, and my attack was therefore made against the forces in my front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Further along he mentions these batteries as playing upon the confused masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Here he states that he moved against the enemy in his front, and does not lead <num value="1">one</num> to infer, as in the <rs>Gettysburg</rs> article, that he pursued and followed up the crushed column, already defeated in front of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0119.0010.00062.00592" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:10"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>There were various opinions in regard to the strength of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>The sequel proved it consisted of a brigade of infantry and a portion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="7ILCav">Seventh Illinois cavalry</orgName>--a force about equal in numbers to our own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>The cavalry occupied the fair grounds, immediately north of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>The <num value="3">three</num> positions were from <num value="0.5">a half</num> to <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile from each other, and a simultaneous attack upon each would have necessitated the movement of a portion of the troops around the town, which, owing to the darkness and the nature of the ground, would have been impracticable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>Everything indicated that the enemy had no suspicion of our approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>At daybreak the column was moved forward until within about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> of the pickets, when a staff officer pointed out their position and ordered us to ride them down without firing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>We moved forward at a trot, soon increased to a gallop, and when a turn in the road brought the pickets in view, they were standing peering at us through the gloom, evidently unable to decide whether we were friend or foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>Another turn in the road, and the white tents of the camp were in full view.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>The scene of a regiment, with night garments fluttering to the breeze, trying to dodge an avalanche of horsemen, was truly laughable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>Apparently there was no thought of resistance, and in a few moments the comedy ended without a shot being fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>The attack on the centre of the town was also a perfect success, although being a few moments later the surprise was not quite so complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>The cavalry at the fair grounds made a spirited defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>It was a gallant but hopeless effort.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>Nothing has been farther from me than to <quote>quietly assume the accusation of breach of faith.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>It is true I have said that we (the <name>Prussian</name> officers), <hi rend="italics">according to our understanding</hi>, could never comprehend how an officer could ever feel called upon to decide on which side he will fight, if <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> contending parties carries the flag to which he has pledged his faith and allegiance by a solemn oath, and that, therefore, <hi rend="italics">to our understanding</hi>, the decision of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0119.0028.00190.02231" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> would always remain incomprehensible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>This part of my lecture, no doubt, gave origin to <persName n="Thompson,Doctor,,,," id="n0119.0028.00190.02232" reg="mostcommon:Thompson,Joseph,P.,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Thompson</surname></persName>'s remark, that to a Prussian officer the violation of an oath appears a crime so damnable as to be inconceivable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>Now, I do not pretend to say that a Prussian officer is any more sensitive to the guilt, of the violation of an oath than any other honorable man, and by the very emphasis I put on the words--<hi rend="italics">our understanding</hi>--I meant to induce the hearer to refrain from judging and condemning <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0119.0028.00190.02233" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, as there must be circumstances veiled <hi rend="italics">to our understanding</hi>, which, if fully known and appreciated by us, would let <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0119.0028.00190.02234" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s decision appear in another light than that of the violation of an oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>Moreover, I then went on to say (and I translate the following paragraph literally from the Ms. of my lecture): <quote>The more incomprehensible it is to us that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0119.0028.00190.02235" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> came to this and not to the opposite decision, the more it becomes our duty to seek an explanation; and if we consider all the circumstances, we think we are justified in saying that a <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>man who gave to his son, just admitted to the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName>, as a leading motto for his professional career the beautiful words: <q direct="unspecified"> Duty is the sublimest word of our language,</q> --could follow only that path, which, after earnest reflection, he was convinced his duty commanded him to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>This conclusion is warranted by the stainless purity of his character, which makes his image as a man so noble and sublime; it is warranted by his truly <name>Christian</name> disposition and his simple, almost childlike piety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>But if we should want Further proof, we could find it in the answer he gave, when, after the war, he was asked directly by the <rs>Reconstruction Committee</rs> what were his personal views on the question of secession: <q direct="unspecified"> It was my view,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified"> that the act of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in withdrawing herself from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, carried me along with it as a citizen of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and that her laws and acts were binding on me.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>The place &mdash; the old <quote><placeName reg="Clifton house">Clifton house</placeName></quote> --was well fortified, and had the additional protection of the river along the entire front of perhaps a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>The works extended from the <rs>Appomattox</rs> on the right to <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Swift creek</placeName> on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>There were some guns of heavy calibre, mounted and ready for action, and in addition to these some field-pieces disposed along the line at suitable points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>The enemy had formidable works opposite, but had not used <pb id="p.194" n="194"/>their guns to disturb the quiet routine of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>The river bank was picketed by details from the artillery armed as infantry, but without the usual equipments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>The guard duty was so heavy that half the men were always on guard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>The huts, built by the troops who had formerly occupied the place, were located, with a view to protection from the enemy's fire, under the hills on the sides of the ravines or gullies which divided them, and were underground to the eaves of the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>Consequently, the soil being sandy, there was a constant filtering of sand through the cracks, and in spite of the greatest care the grit found its way into the flour and meal, stuck to the greasy frying-pan and even filled the hair of the men as they slept in their bunks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>At this time rations were reduced to the minimum of quantity and quality, being generally worm-eaten peas, sour or rancid messpork and unbolted <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>, relieved occasionally with a small supply of luscious canned beef imported from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, good flour (half-rations), a little coffee and sugar, and, once, <rs n="apple brandy" type="product">apple brandy</rs> for all hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>Ragged, barefooted and even bareheaded men were so common that they did not excite notice or comment, and did not expect or seem to feel the want of sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>And yet there was scarcely a complaint or murmur of dissatisfaction and not the slightest indication of fear or doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>The spirit of the men was as good as ever and the possibility of immediate disaster had not cast its shadow there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>Several incidents occurred during the stay of the battalion at <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 3" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Clifton</placeName> which will serve to illustrate everyday life on the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>It occurred to a man picketing the river bank that it would be amusing to take careful aim at the man on the other side doing the same duty for the enemy, fire, laugh to see the fellow jump and dodge, and then try again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/>He fired, laughed, dropped his musket to reload, and while smiling with satisfaction heard the <quote>thud</quote> of a bullet and felt an agonizing pain in his arm. His musket fell to the ground and he walked back to camp with his arm swinging heavily at his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>The surgeon soon relieved him of it altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>The poor fellow learned a lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>The <quote><persName n="Yank,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00194.02268" reg="mostcommon:Yank,nomatch:0"><surname>Yank</surname></persName></quote> had beat him at his own game.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>The guard-house was a <num value="2">two</num>-story framed building about <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> square, having <num value="2">two</num> rooms, <num value="1">one</num> above the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>The detail for guard duty was required to stay in the guard-house; those who wished to sleep going up stairs, while others just relieved or about to go on duty clustered around the fire in the lower room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/><num value="1">One</num> <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>night, when the upper floor was covered with sleeping men, an improvised infantryman who had been relieved from duty walked in, and preparatory to taking his stand at the fire, threw his musket carelessly in the corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>A loud report and angry exclamations immediately followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>The sergeant of the guard, noticing the direction of the ball, hurried up stairs, and to the disgust of the sleepy fellows, ordered all hands to <quote>turn out.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>Grumbling, growling, stretching and rubbing their eyes, the men got up. Some <num value="1">one</num> inquired, <quote>where's Pryor?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>His chum, who had been sleeping by his side, replied <quote>there he is asleep &mdash; shake him!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>His blanket was drawn aside, and with a shake he was commanded to <quote>get up!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>But there was no motion, no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>The ball had passed through his heart, and he had passed without a groan or a sigh from deep sleep to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>The man who was killed and the man who was sleeping by his side, under the same blanket, were members of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Company">Second company</orgName> Richmond Howitzers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>The careless man who made the trouble was also an artilleryman, from <num value="1">one</num> of the other batteries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>Shortly after this accident, after a quiet day, the men retired to their huts and the whole camp was still as a country church-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>The pickets on the river's edge could hear those on the opposite side asking the corporal of the guard the hour and complaining that they had not been promptly relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>Suddenly a terrific bombardment commenced and the earth fairly trembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>The men, suddenly awakened, heard the roar of the guns, the rush of the shots and the explosion of the shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>To a man only half awake the shells seemed to pass very near and in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>In a moment all were rushing out of their houses, and soon the hillsides and bluffs were covered with an excited crowd, gazing awestruck on the sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>The firing was away to the right, and there was not the slightest danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/>Having realized this fact, the interest was intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>The shells from the opposite lines met and passed in mid air-their burning fuses forming an arch of fire which paled occasionally as a shell burst, illuminating the heavens with its blaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>The uproar, even at such a distance, was terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>The officers, fearing that fire would be opened along the whole line, ordered the cannoneers to their posts; men were sent down into the magazine with lanterns to arrange the ammunition for the heavy guns; the lids of the limbers of the field-pieces were thrown up; the cannoneers were counted off at their posts; the brush which had been piled before the embrasures was torn away, and with implements in hand all stood at attention till <pb id="p.196" n="196"/>the last shot was fired,--the heavens were dark again and silence reigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>Soon all hands were as sound asleep as though nothing had occurred.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>The next morning an artilleryman came walking leisurely towards the camp, and being recognized as belonging to a battery which was in position on that part of the line where the firing of the last night occurred, was plied with questions as to the loss on our side, who was hurt, &amp;c., &amp;c. Smiling at the anxious faces and eager questions, he replied: <quote>When?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/>Last night?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>Nobody!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>It was astounding, but nevertheless true.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>On another occasion some scattering shots were heard up the river, and after awhile a body came floating down the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>It was hauled on shore and buried in the sand a little above high-water mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>It was a poor Confederate who had attempted to desert to the enemy but was shot while swimming for the opposite bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>His grave was the centre of the beat of <num value="1">one</num> of the picket posts on the river bank, and there were few men so indifferent to the presence of the dead as not to prefer some other post.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>And so while there had been no fighting there were always incidents to remind the soldier that danger lurked around, and that he could not long avoid his share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/>The camp was not as joyous as it had been, and all felt that the time was near which would try the courage of the stoutest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>The struggles of the troops on the right with overwhelming numbers and reports of adversities, caused a general expectation that the troops lying so idly at the <rs type="place">Clifton house</rs> would be ordered to the point of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>They had not long to wait.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>Sunday came and went as many a Sunday had. There was nothing unusual apparent, unless, perhaps, the dull and listless attitudes of the men and the monotonous call of those on guard were more oppressive than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>The sun went down, the hills and valleys and the river were veiled in darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/>Here and there twinkling lights were visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>On the other side of the river could be heard a low rumbling which experienced men said was the movement of artillery and ammunition trains bound to the enemy's left to press the already broken right of the <rs>Confederate</rs> line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>Some had actually gone to sleep for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>Others were huddled around the fires in the little huts, and a few sat out on the hillside discussing the probabilities of the near future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>A most peaceful scene &mdash; a most peaceful spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>Hymns were sung and <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>prayers were made, though no preacher was there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>Memory reverted fondly to the past, to home and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>The spirit of the soldier soared away to other scenes and left <hi rend="italics">him</hi> to sit blankly down, gaze at the stars and feel unspeakable longings for undefined joys, and weep, for very tenderness of heart, at his own sad loneliness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>At <time value="10pm">10 P. M.</time> some man, mounted on horseback, rode up to <num value="1">one</num> of the huts and said the battalion had orders to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>It was so dark that his face was scarcely visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>In a few minutes orders were received to destroy what could be destroyed without noise or fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>This was promptly done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>Then the companies were formed, the roll was called and the battalion marched slowly and solemnly away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>No <num value="1">one</num> doubted that the command would march at once to the assistance of the troops at or near <placeName reg="Five Forks, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111769">Five Forks</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>It was thought that before morning every man would have his musket and his supply of ammunition, and the crack of day would see the battalion rushing into battle in regular infantry style, whooping and yelling like demons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>But they got no arms that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>The march was steady till broad day of Monday the <dateStruct value="-04-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>Of course the men felt mortified at having to leave the guns, but there was no help for it, as the battery horses which had been sent away to winter had not returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>It was evident that the battalion had bid farewell to artillery and commenced a new career as infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>As the night wore on the men learned that the command was not going to any point on the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>That being determined, no <num value="1">one</num> could guess its destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>Later in the night, probably as day approached, the sky in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was lit with the red glare of distant conflagration, and at short intervals there were deep, growling explosions as of magazines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>The roads were filled with other troops, all hurrying in the same direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>There was no sign of panic or fear, but the very wheels seemed turning with unusual energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>The men wore the look of determination, haste and eagerness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/><num value="1">One</num> could feel the energy which surrounded him and animated the men and things which moved so steadily on, on, on!! There was no laughing, singing or talking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>Nothing but the steady tread of the column and the surly rumbling of the trains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>As morning dawned, the battalion struck the main road leading from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>Refugees told the story of the evacuation and informed the boys from the city that it was in the hands of the <pb id="p.198" n="198"/>enemy and burning, and the chances were that not <num value="1">one</num> house would be left standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>Here it became clearly understood that the whole army was in full retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>From this point the men began to say, as they marched, that it was easier to march away than it would be to get back, but that they expected and hoped to <hi rend="italics">fight</hi> their way back if they had to contest every inch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>Some even regretted the celerity of the march, for, they said, <quote>the further we march the more difficult it will be to win our way back.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>Little did they know of the immense pressure at the rear and the earnest push of the enemy on the flank as he strove to reach and overlap the advance of his hitherto defiant but now retreating foe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2577"/>A detail had been left at <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 3" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Clifton</placeName> with orders to spike the guns, blow up the magazine, destroy everything which could be of value to the enemy, and rejoin the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/>The order was obeyed, and every man of the detail resumed his place in the ranks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2579"/>From this point to <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, the march was almost continuous, day and night, and it is with the greatest difficulty that a private in the ranks can recall with accuracy the dates and places on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2580"/>Night was day,--day was night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2581"/>There was no stated time to sleep, eat or rest, and the events of morning became strangely intermingled with the events of evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>Breakfast, dinner and supper were merged into <quote>something to eat</quote> whenever and wherever it could be had. The incidents of the march, however, lose none of their significance on this account, and, so far as possible, they will be given in the order in which they occurred and the day and hour fixed as accurately as they can be by those who witnessed and participated in its dangers and hardships.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>Monday the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> the column was pushed along without ceremony at a rapid pace until night, when a halt was ordered and the battalion laid down in a piece of pine woods to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>There was some <quote>desultory</quote> eating in this camp, but so little of it that there was no lasting effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>At early dawn of Tuesday the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, the men struggled to their feet, and with empty stomachs and brave hearts resumed their places in the ranks, and struggled on with the column as it marched steadily in the direction of <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00198.02269" reg="mostcommon:Moore,Thomas,O.,,:1"><surname>Moore</surname></persName>'s church, in <placeName reg="Amelia, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002139">Amelia county</placeName>, where it arrived in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>The men laid down under the shelter of a fine grove, and friend divided with friend the little supplies of raw bacon and bread picked up on the day's march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>The men were scarcely stretched on the ground and ready for a good nap, when the orderly of the <name>Howitzers</name> commenced <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>bawling, <quote>Detail for guard!! Detail for guard!! Fall in here, fall in!!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>Then followed the names of the detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/><num value="4">Four</num> men answered to their names, but declared they could not keep awake if placed on guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>Their remonstrance was in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>They were marched off to picket a road leading to camp, and when they were relieved said they had slept soundly on their posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>No <num value="1">one</num> blamed them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>While it was yet night, all hands were roused from profound sleep, the battalion was formed and away they went, stumbling, bumping against each other, and <hi rend="italics">sleeping as they walked</hi>. Whenever the column halted for a moment, as it did frequently during the night, the men dropped heavily to the ground and were instantly asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>Then the officers would commence: <quote>Forward!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/>Column forward!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2596"/>I</quote> Those <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> on their feet stumbling on over their prostrate comrades, who would in turn be awakened, and again the column was in motion, and nothing heard but the monotonous tread of the weary feet, the ringing and rattling of the trappings of the horses and the never ending cry of <quote>Close up men, close up!!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2597"/>Through the long, weary night there was no rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>The alternate halting and hurrying was terribly trying and taxed the endurance of the most determined men to the very utmost; and yet on the morning of Wednesday the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, when the battalion reached the neighborhood of <quote><persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00199.02270" reg="mostcommon:Scott,R.,N.,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s shops,</quote> every man was in place and ready for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2599"/>From this point, after some ineffectual efforts to get a breakfast, the column pushed on in the direction of <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName>, at which point <persName n="Cutshaw,Colonel,,,," id="n0119.0029.00199.02271" reg="mostcommon:Cutshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Cutshaw</surname></persName> was ordered to report to <persName n="Walker,General,James,A.,," id="n0119.0029.00199.02272" reg="default:Walker,James,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, and the battalion was thereafter a part of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00199.02273" reg="nearbymention:Walker,James,A.,,"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2600"/>The <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> was spent at or near the <rs type="place">Courthouse</rs>-how, it is difficult to remember; but the day was marked by several incidents worthy of record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2601"/>About <num value="225">two hundred and twenty-five</num> muskets (not enough to arm all the men), cartridges and caps were issued to the battalion: simply the muskets and ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>Not a cartridge box, cap box, belt or any other convenience ornamented the persons of these newborn infantrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>They stored their ammunition in their pockets along with their corn, salt, pipes and tobacco.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>When application was made for rations, it was found that the last morsel belonging to the division had been issued to the command, and the battalion was again thrown on its own resources, to wit: corn on the cob intended for the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/><num value="2">Two</num> ears were issued to each man. It was parched in the coals, mixed with salt, stored in the pockets and eaten on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>Chewing the corn was hard <pb id="p.200" n="200"/>work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>It made the jaws ache and the gums and teeth so sore as to cause almost unendurable pain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>After the muskets were issued a line of battle was formed with <persName n="Cutshaw,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00200.02274" reg="mostcommon:Cutshaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Cutshaw</surname></persName> on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>For what purpose the line was formed the men could not tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>A short distance from the right of the line there was a grove which concealed an ammunition train which had been sent from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to meet the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>The ammunition had been piled up ready for destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>An occasional musket ball passed over near enough and often enough to produce a realizing sense of the proximity of the enemy and solemnize the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>Towards evening the muskets were stacked, artillery style of course, the men were lying around, chatting and eating raw bacon, and there was general quiet, when suddenly the earth shook with a tremendous explosion and an immense column of smoke rushed up into the air to a great height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>For a moment there was the greatest consternation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>Whole regiments broke and fled in wild confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/><persName n="Cutshaw,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00200.02275" reg="mostcommon:Cutshaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Cutshaw</surname></persName>'s men stood up, seized their muskets and stood at attention till it was known that the ammunition had been purposely fired and no enemy was threatening the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>Then, what laughter and hilarity prevailed, for awhile,among these famishing men!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>Order having been restored, the march was resumed, and moving by way of <placeName reg="Amelia Springs, Amelia, Virginia" key="tgn,2131946">Amelia springs</placeName>, the column arrived near <placeName reg="Deatonsville">Deatonsville</placeName> about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> the morning of Thursday the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>The march, though not a long <num value="1">one</num>, was exceedingly tiresome, as the main roads being crowded, the column moved by plantation roads, which were in wretched condition, and crowded with troops and trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>That the night was spent in the most trying manner, may be best learned from the fact that when morning dawned the column was only <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> from the starting point of the evening before.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>This delay was fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>The movement of the division was regulated to suit the movements of the wagon trains, which should have been destroyed on the spot, and the column allowed to make its best time, as owing to the delay it occasioned the army lost the time it had gained on the enemy in the start, and was overtaken the next day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/>At <placeName reg="Deatonsville">Deatonsville</placeName> another effort to cook was made, but before the <pb id="p.201" n="201"/>simplest articles of food could be prepared, the order to march was given, and the battalion took the road once more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>A short while after passing <placeName reg="Deatonsville">Deatonsville</placeName>, the column was formed in line of battle &mdash; <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Cutshaw,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00201.02278" reg="mostcommon:Cutshaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Cutshaw</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName> near the road and in an old field with woods in front and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>The officers, anticipating an immediate attack, ordered the men to do what they could for their protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>They immediately scattered along the fence on the roadside, and taking down the rails stalked back to their position in line, laid the rails on the ground and returned for another load.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>This they continued to do until the whole of the fence was removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>Behind this slim defence they silently awaited the advance of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>Soon it was decided that this was not the place to make a stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> detachment of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Company">Second company</orgName> of Richmond Howitzers, and <num value="20">twenty</num> men each from <persName n="Garber,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00201.02279" reg="mostcommon:Garber,nomatch:0"><surname>Garber</surname></persName> and <persName n="Fry,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00201.02280" reg="mostcommon:Fry,B.,D.,,:1"><surname>Fry</surname></persName>, under the command of <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,Henry,,," id="n0119.0029.00201.02281" reg="default:Jones,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, were left behind the fence-rail work, with orders to resist and retard the advance of the enemy while the column continued its march.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>This little band was composed of true spirits &mdash; the best material in the battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>Right well did they do their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>Left alone to face the advance of the immense host eagerly pursuing the worn remnant of the invincible army, they waited until the enemy's skirmishers appeared in the field, when, with perfect deliberation, they commenced their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>Though greatly outnumbered and flanked right and left, they stubbornly held on till the line of battle following the skirmishers broke from the woods and advancing rapidly, poured into them a murderous volley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>And yet, so unused were they to running, they moved not till the infantry skirmishers had retired and the word of command was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>Then stubbornly contesting the ground, they fought their way back through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>The gallant <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0119.0029.00201.02282" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> fell mortally wounded, having held control of his little band to the moment he fell.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>The battalion had left this point but a short time, marching in column of fours with the division, and had reached the brow of a gently sloping hill, perfectly open for perhaps a mile, with a broad <pb id="p.202" n="202"/>valley on the left, and beyond it a range of hills partly wooded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>In an open space on this range the enemy placed a battery in position, and in anticipation of doing great slaughter from a safe distance, opened a rapid fire on the exposed and helpless column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>The shells came hurtling over the valley, exploding in front, rear and overhead, and tearing up the ground in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>Ah! how it grieved those artillerymen to stand, musket in hand, and receive that shower of insolence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>How they longed for the old friends they had left at <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 3" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Clifton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>They knew how those rascals on the other side of the valley were enjoying the sport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>They could hear in imagination the shouts of the cannoneers as they saw their shells bursting so prettily, and rammed home another shot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>There was some impediment ahead, and there the column stood, a fair mark for these rascals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>There was no help near, and all that could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>be done was to stand firm and wait orders; but help was coming!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>A cloud of dust was approaching from the rear of the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2654"/>All eyes were strained to see what it might mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>Presently the artillerymen recognized the well known sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>A battery was coming in full gallop, the drivers lashing their horses, and yelling like madmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>The guns bounded along as though they would outrun the horses, and with rush, roar and rattle they approached the front of the battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2661"/>Not a moment was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2662"/>The guns were in battery, and the smoke of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot was curling about the heads of the men in the column in marvelously quick time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2663"/>Friends and comrades in the column called to the men at the guns, and they, as they stepped in and out, responded with cheerful, ringing voices: <quote>Hello bill!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>As the battalion moved on, the gallant boys of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Company">Third company</orgName> finished their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>The disappointed enemy limbered up, slipped into the woods and departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>Cheered by this fortunate meeting with old comrades and with the pleasant odor of the smoke lingering around them, these hitherto bereft and mournful artillerymen pushed on, laughing cheerily at the discomfiture of the enemy, and feeling that though deprived .of their guns by the <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>misfortunes of war, there was still left at least <num value="1">one</num> battery worthy to represent the artillery of the army.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>More for amusement than anything else, it was proposed to fire at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>A group of men gathered on the roadside, a volley was fired, and to the amazement of the marksmen, for the distance was great, <num value="1">one</num> of the skirmishers fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> man then scampered away as fast as his legs could carry him. The battalion applauded the good shots and marched on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>At Sailor's creek the detachment which had been left at <placeName reg="Deatonsville">Deatonsville</placeName> behind the fence rails to watch and retard the approach of the enemy, having slowly retired before their advance, rejoined the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>Indeed, their resistance and retreat was the beginning of and ended in the battle of Sailor's creek.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>The line of battle was formed on <placeName reg="Locket's hill">Locket's hill</placeName>, which sloped gently down from the line to the creek, about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> or <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> in rear of and running nearly parallel with the line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>A road divided the battalion near the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>The Howitzers were on the left of this road and in the woods; <persName n="Garber,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00203.02284" reg="mostcommon:Garber,nomatch:0"><surname>Garber</surname></persName>'s men were on the right of the <name>Howitzers</name>, on the opposite side of the road, in a field; <persName n="Fry,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00203.02285" reg="mostcommon:Fry,B.,D.,,:1"><surname>Fry</surname></persName>'s men on the extreme left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>To cross the road dividing the line was a hazardous experiment, as the enemy, thinking it an important avenue, swept it with musketry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>It was amusing to see the men hauling out of their pockets a mixture of corn, salt, caps and cartridges, and, selecting the material needed, loading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>They were getting ready to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>They did not expect to run, and did not until ordered to do so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>The enemy's skirmishers advanced confidently and in rather free and easy style, but suddenly met a volley which drove them to cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>Again they advanced in better order, and again the improvised infantry forced them back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>Then came their line of battle, with overwhelming numbers; but the battalion stubbornly resisted their advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>The men, not accustomed to the orderly manner of infantry, dodged about from tree to tree, and with the deliberation of huntsmen picked off here and there a man. When a shot <quote>told,</quote> the marksman hurrahed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>all to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>There was an evident desire to press forward and drive .the advancing foe. Several of the men were so enthusiastic that they had pushed <pb id="p.204" n="204"/>ahead of the line, and several yards in advance they could be seen loading and firing as deliberately as though practicing at a mark.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>He was near being captured, but by hurrying away the ambulance at a gallop, he escaped to a house a short distance in the rear, where he fell into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>The same night he suffered amputation of a leg. <persName n="Garber,Captain,,,," id="n0119.0029.00204.02287" reg="mostcommon:Garber,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Garber</surname></persName> was struck, and called for the <orgName n="Ambulance Corps" type="corps">ambulance corps</orgName>, but on examination found the ball in his pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>It had lodged against the rowel of a spur which he found the day before and dropped in his pocket.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>At last the enemy appeared in strong force on both flanks, while he pushed hard in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>It was useless to attempt a further stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>The voice of <persName n="Jones,Captain,,,," id="n0119.0029.00204.02288" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, of the <name>Howitzers</name>, rang out loud and clear: <quote>Boys, take care of yourselves!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>Saying this, he planted himself against a pine, and as his men rushed by him, emptied every chamber of his revolver at the enemy, and then reluctantly made his way, in company with several privates, down the hill to the creek.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>At the foot of the hill a group of perhaps a dozen men gathered around <persName n="McRae,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0119.0029.00204.02289" reg="mostcommon:McRae,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>McRae</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>He was indignant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>He proposed another stand, and his comrades agreed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>They stood in the road facing the gentle slope of the hill from which they had been ordered to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>The enemy's skirmishers were already on the brow of hill, dodging about among the trees and shouting to those behind to hurry up. Their favorite expressions were--<quote>Come along, boys; here are the damned Rebel wagons!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/><quote>Damn 'em, shoot 'em down!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>In a few moments their line of battle, in beautiful order, stepped out of the woods with colors flying, and for a moment halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>In front of the centre of that portion of the line which was visible-probably a full regimental front-marched the colors and <orgName n="Color Guard" type="guard">color guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>He ordered his squad to rise and fire on the colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/>His order was promptly obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>The color-bearer pitched forward and fell, with his colors, heavily to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>The guard of <num value="2">two</num> men on either side shared the same fate, or else feigned it. Immediately the line of battle broke into disorder and came swarming down the hill, firing, yelling and cursing as they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>An officer, mounted, rode his horse close to the fence on the roadside, and with the most superb insolence mocked <persName n="McRae,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00204.02291" reg="mostcommon:McRae,nomatch:0"><surname>McRae</surname></persName> and his squad, already, as he thought, hopelessly intermingled <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>But the private's gun was not in working order, and the fellow escaped &mdash; for the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>Before he reached the woods, whither he was going to hurry up the <quote>boys,</quote> a Howitzer let fly at him, and at the shock of the bullet's stroke, he threw his arms up in the air and his horse bore him into the woods a corpse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>A little to the left, where the road crossed the creek, the crack of pistols and the <quote>bang</quote> of muskets was continuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>The enemy had surrounded the wagons and were mercilessly shooting down the unarmed and helpless drivers, some of whom, however, managed to cut the traces, mount and escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>In order to escape from the right of the line, it was necessary to follow the road, which was along the foot of the hill, some distance to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>The enemy seeing this, were pushing their men rapidly at a right oblique to gain the road and cut off retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>Consequently, those who attempted escape in that direction had to run the gauntlet of a constant fusilade from a mass of troops near enough to select individuals, curse them and command them to throw down their arms or be shot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>Most of <persName n="McRae,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00205.02293" reg="mostcommon:McRae,nomatch:0"><surname>McRae</surname></persName>'s squad, in spite of the difficulties surrounding them, gained the creek, plunged in, and began a race for life up the long, open hillside of plowed ground, fired upon at every step by the swarm of men behind, and, before they reached the top, by a battery in close proximity, which poured down a shower of cannister.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>The race to the top of the long hill was exceedingly trying to men already exhausted by continual marching, hunger, thirst and loss of sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>They ran, panting for breath, like chased animals, fairly staggering as they went.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>On the top of this long hill there was a skirmish line of cavalry posted with orders to stop all men with arms in their hands and form a new line; but the view down the hill to the creek and beyond revealed such a host of the enemy, and the men retiring before them were so few, that the order was disregarded and the fleeing band allowed to pass through.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>The men's faces were black with powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>They had bitten cartridges until there was a deep black circle around their mouths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>The burnt powder from the ramrods had blackened their hands, and in their efforts to remove the perspiration from their faces they <pb id="p.206" n="206"/>had completed the coloring from the roots of the hair to the chin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>Here was no place for rest, however, as the enemy's battery behind the creek on the opposite hills, having gotten the range, was pouring in a lively fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>Soon after passing the brow of the hill, darkness came on. Groups of men from the battalion halted on the roadside, near a framed building of some sort, and commenced shouting, <quote>Fall in Howitzers!!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>Thus of their own accord trying to recover the organization from its disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>Quite a number of the battalion got together, and in spite of hunger, thirst, defeat and dreadful weariness, pushed on to the <rs type="place">High bridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>So anxious were the men to escape capture and the insinuation of desertion that when threatened with shooting by the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, if they did not move on, they scarcely turned to see who spoke: but the simple announcement <quote>the <rs>Yankees</rs> are coming!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>gave them a little new strength, and again they struggled painfully along, dropping in the road sound asleep, however, at the slightest halt of the column.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>At the bridge there was quite a halt, and in the darkness the men commenced calling to each other by name &mdash; the rascally infantry around, still ready for fun &mdash; answering for every name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>Arrived on the other side, the wornout soldiers fell to the ground and slept, more dead than alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>Some had slept as they marched across the bridge, and declared that they had no distinct recollection of when they left it, or how long they were upon it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>Early on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="7">7th</day></dateStruct>, the march was resumed and continued through <placeName key="tgn,7014170" n="1.000 62" reg="farmville, prince edward, virginia">Farmville</placeName>, across the bridge and to <placeName reg="Cumberland Heights, Mercer, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117942">Cumberland heights</placeName>, overlooking the town.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>While standing thus in line a detail was sent into the town to <pb id="p.207" n="207"/>hunt up some rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>The detail secured a piece and marched back triumphantly to their waiting comrades.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>After considerable delay the line broke into column and marched away in the direction of <placeName reg="Curdsville, Buckingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2111399">Curdsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>All along the line of march the enemy's cavalry followed close on the flanks of the column, and whenever an opportunity offered swooped down upon the trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>All arrangements completed, the men deployed and entered the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>They had advanced but a short distance, when they encountered a strong line of picket-posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Firing and cheering they rushed on the surprised men, who scampered away, leaving all their little conveniences behind them, and drove them for about a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>From this point large bodies of the enemy were visible, crowding the hilltops like a <rs type="color">blue</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs> cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>It was not many minutes before a strong line of dismounted cavalry, followed by mounted men, deployed from this mass to cover the retreat of their fleeing brethren and restore the picket line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>They came down the hills and across the fields, firing as they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>On looking around to see what were the chances for making a stand, <persName n="McRae,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0119.0029.00210.02318" reg="mostcommon:McRae,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>McRae</surname></persName> found that the infantry skirmishers had been withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>The officer who had commanded them could be seen galloping away in the distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>The little squad, knowing they were alone, kept up a brisk fire on the advancing enemy, till he was close up in front and well to the rear of both flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>On the left, not more than <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure>, a column of cavalry, marching by twos, had crossed the line and were still marching, as unconcernedly as possible, to the rear of <persName n="McRae,,,,," id="n0119.0029.00210.02319" reg="mostcommon:McRae,nomatch:0"><surname>McRae</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>So they retired, slowly, stubbornly and returning shot for shot with the enemy, who came on at a trot, cheering valiantly, as they pursued <num value="4">four</num> men and a lieutenant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>The men dragged the butts of their old muskets behind them, loading as they walked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/>All loaded, they turned, halted, fired, received a shower of balls in return, and then again moved doggedly to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>A little lieutenant <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>of infantry, who had been on the skirmish line, joined the squad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>He was armed with a revolver and had his sword by his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>Stopping behind the corner of a corn-crib he swore he would not go any further to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>The squad moved on and left him standing there, pistol in hand, waiting for the enemy, who were now jumping the fences and coming across the field, running at the top of their speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>What became of this singular man no <num value="1">one</num> knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>He was, as he said, <quote>determined to make a stand.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>A little further on the squad found a single piece of artillery, manned by a lieutenant and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>The offer was refused, and again the squad moved on. Passing a cowshed about this time, the squad halted to look with horror upon several dead and wounded Confederates who lay there upon the manure pile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>They had suffered wounds and death upon this the last day of their country's struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>The whole fleet were again put in motion <pb id="p.225" n="225"/>to receive her, and she received <num value="4">four</num> tremendous shocks by the heaviest vessels running into her at full speed; soon after which I received an order from you in person to stand for <placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName>, as it had been reported by the <rs type="role" reg="acting-chief-Engineer">acting chief-engineer</rs> that the ship was leaking rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>At this time it was reported to me that the wheel-chain had been carried away, and, ordering the relieving tackles to be used, I made a personal examination of the broken chain to ascertain if it could be repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>This was found to be impossible without sending men outside of the shield to expose themselves several minutes to the fire of the enemy's vessels, by which the after-deck over which the chains lead was closely watched and constantly swept until the close, of the action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>Returning to the pilot-house for the purpose of observing more closely the movements of the enemy, I soon received a report that you had been wounded; when I went aft to see you, and while there, learned that the after-port cover had been struck by a shot, which instantly killed a man engaged in removing the pivot bolt upon which it revolved, and wounded yourself and <num value="1">one</num> of the gun's crew, the latter mortally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/>I then learned that the <num value="2">two</num> quarter-port covers had been so jammed by the fire of the enemy as to render it impracticable to remove them; and the relieving tackles had been shot away, and the tiller unshipped from the rudder-head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>The smoke-pipe having been completely riddled by shot, was knocked down close to the top of the shield by the concussion of vessels running into the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>At the same time the <num value="3">three</num> monitors were using their <num value="11">eleven</num> and <measure n="15inch" type="distance">fifteen-inch</measure> solid shot against the after end of the shield, while the largest of the wooden vessels were pouring in separate broadsides at the distance of only a few feet; and I regret to say that many favorable opportunities of sinking those vessels were unavoidably lost by failure of our gun-primers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>The bow-port cover was struck by a heavy shot, as also the cover of the forward port on the port side; and <num value="2">two</num> of the broadside-port covers were entirely unshipped by the enemy's shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>The enemy was not long in perceiving that our steering gear had been entirely disabled, and his monitors and heaviest vessels at once took position at each quarter and stern, from whence they poured in their fire without intermission for a period of nearly half an hour, while we were unable to bring a single gun to bear, as it was impossible to change the position of the vessel, and the steam was rapidly going down as a natural consequence of the loss of the smoke pipe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>Feeling it my duty to inform <pb id="p.226" n="226"/>you of the condition of the vessel, I went to the berth deck for this purpose, and, after making my report, asked if you did not think we had better surrender, to which you replied, <quote>Do the best you can, and when all is done, surrender,</quote> or words to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>Upon my returning to the gun-deck, I observed <num value="1">one</num> of the heaviest vessels of the enemy in the act of running into us on the port quarter, while the shot were fairly raining upon the after end of the shield, which was now so thoroughly shattered that in a few moments it would have fallen and exposed the gun deck to a raking fire of shell and grape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>Realizing our helpless condition at a glance, and conceiving that the ship was now nothing more than a target for the heavy guns of the enemy, I concluded that no good object could be accomplished by sacrificing the lives of the officers and men in such a <num value="1">one</num>-sided contest, and therefore proceeded to the top of the shield and took down the ensign, which had been lashed on to the handle of a gun-scraper and stuck up through the grating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>While in the act several shots passed close to me, and when I went below to order the engines to be stopped, the fire of the enemy was continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>I then decided, though with an almost bursting heart, to hoist the white flag; and, returning again to the shield, I placed it in the spot where but a few moments before had floated the proud flag for whose honor I would so cheerfully have sacrificed my own life, if I could possibly have become the only victim; but at that time it would have been impossible to destroy the ship without the certain loss of many valuable lives, your own among the number.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>From whom this fire proceeded I have never learned, but it seemed to serve as a signal for the enemy's battery to resume its fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>We had not gone far when he laid down on the litter and we took it up and were carrying him along, when the cannonade became so terrific that the <num value="2">two</num> litter-carriers abandoned the litter, leaving no <num value="1">one</num> with <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0119.0036.00233.02541" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> but <persName n="Smith,Captain,,,," id="n0119.0036.00233.02542" reg="nearbymention:Smith,H.,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>We laid the <rs>General</rs> down in the middle of the road and ourselves beside him. The road was perfectly swept by grape and canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>A few minutes before, it had been crowded with men and horses, and now I could see no man or beast or thing upon it but ourselves.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>The painful matter of the treatment of the prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> is not so candidly handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>It appears that the frightful mortality arose in part from the poor quality and character of the food, for which the authorities were not perhaps wholly to blame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>The more potent causes were, however, the over-crowding, the foul water, the total absence of drainage, shelter, &amp;c. As there was an abundance of vacant land near, and also of water and timber, these evils might easily have been cured by putting the prisoners at work enlarging the stockade, digging drains, building huts, and so forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>Yet the horrible mortality continued without any attempt at amelioration through the year of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the deaths reaching during that frightful summer <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> in the <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> usually confined there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>There had been some attempts to escape by prisoners employed on the works, and no doubt it was supposed that by exchange or removal the number might be diminished; but that surely cannot excuse the continued neglect of the most simple <pb id="p.236" n="236"/>precautions when men were dying from <num value="50">fifty</num> to a <num value="100">hundred</num> a day. <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02565" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wirz,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02566" reg="mostcommon:Wirz,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Wirz</surname></persName> can never be absolved from their awful responsibility for this wholesale slaughter which they could so easily have stopped in great part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>As to how far <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02567" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:10"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> is to be blamed, there will probably always be a difference of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>That he knew in a general way of the enormous mortality, and of the charges against <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02568" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>, cannot be doubted, the agitation was so loud and long, and official reports so outspoken, and he admits that he knew them, but was always convinced that they were unfounded from his reliance on <persName n="Winder,,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02569" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><surname>Winder</surname></persName>'s character; and he certainly paid no attention to them except to enlarge <persName n="Winder,,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02570" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><surname>Winder</surname></persName>'s power &mdash; an indifference for which he can hardly be acquitted at the bar of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>No doubt the <rs>North</rs> might have pushed exchanges, and managed its own prisoners better; but these incidents of warfare cannot excuse <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02571" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>; and the death-rate of Northern prisoners (which has never been satisfactorily calculated, by the way) seems never to have approached the rate of <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>, although it apparently exceeded the other Southern prisons.

But in reference to the criticisms, we have a word of reply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>We are glad that our critic is. constrained to admit that <persName n="Walthall,Major,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02574" reg="mostcommon:Walthall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Walthall</surname></persName> <quote>makes sad work of <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n0119.0037.00236.02575" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s account</quote> of the capture of <pb id="p.237" n="237"/><persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0119.0037.00237.02576" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:10"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, but we respectfully submit that if he will read the paper more carefully, he will find that he does <hi rend="italics">not</hi> <quote>admit that the <rs type="role" reg="ex-President">ex-President</rs> was captured on his way to the spring with women with a pail, and that he had a cloak thrown over him probably for disguise.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>On the contrary, he shows beyond all cavil that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0119.0037.00237.02577" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:10"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> wore no article of woman's attire, and that the <quote>petticoat story,</quote> so industriously circulated and made the subject of phographs and cuts for illustrated papers, was a pure fabrication, palmed off for the purpose of belittleing as gallant a gentleman as ever drew sword in defence of the right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>Our critic thinks our discussion of the treatment of prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> <quote>not so candidly handled.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>Well, we wish he would point out our want of candor and meet our statement of facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>And if he will do so, we hereby offer to publish in full what he may write, provided he will publish our reply in the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Register,,Historical,,," id="n0119.0037.00237.02578" reg="default:Register,Historical,,,"><foreName>Historical</foreName> <surname>Register</surname></persName></hi>. But he will pardon us for saying that, in his very brief notice of our discussion of this question, he is guilty of the want of candor which he charges against us. We freely admitted that there <hi rend="italics">were</hi> probably cases of individual cruelty to prisoners in our hands, but we showed that the laws of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the orders of our authorities, and the whole spirit of our people were opposed to the ill treatment of prisoners in any respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>We gave detailed proofs to show that the mortality of prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> was from causes entirely beyond the control of our Government, and we especially proved that the charge of cruelty to prisoners made against <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0119.0037.00237.02579" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:10"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was so void of a shadow of evidence that even <persName n="Holt,,,,," id="n0119.0037.00237.02580" reg="mostcommon:Holt,nomatch:0"><surname>Holt</surname></persName> and his band of trained perjurers shrunk from going into a trial of the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>We proved that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> made every effort to mitigate the sufferings of Federal prisoners, not only by offering, again and again, to carry out the cartel for the exchange of prisoners, but by proposing to allow each side to send their own surgeons and supplies to their prisoners &mdash; by offering to buy medicines, hospital stores, &amp;c., for the exclusive use of Federal prisoners, paying for them in gold, cotton or tobacco &mdash; and by offering at last, when all other propositions had been refused, <hi rend="italics">to send back without equivalent <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> of the prisoners we held</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>On the other hand, we gave the most abundant proofs that the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities were guilty of every cruelty which they charged against us. We gave the figures to show that the monthly deathroll of Confederates at <placeName reg="Elmira, Chemung, New York" key="tgn,7014109">Elmira</placeName> ranged as high as <hi rend="italics"><num value="0.04">four per cent</num></hi>. of the whole number of prisoners, while at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> it was <hi rend="italics">less than</hi> <pb id="p.238" n="238"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="0.03">three per cent</num></hi>. for the same period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>And we gave the official figures of <persName n="Stanton,Secretary,,,," id="n0119.0037.00238.02581" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Barnes,Surgeon General,,,," id="n0119.0037.00238.02582" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Surgeon General">Surgeon-General</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName> to prove that, taking all of the prisons into the account, <hi rend="italics">more than <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num> more Confederates died in Federal prisons than Federal prisoners in Confederate prisons</hi>. But as our climax we showed that <hi rend="italics">the sufferings on both sides were due to the failure to carry out the terms of the cartel for the exchange of prisoners, and that for this the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities alone (especially <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0119.0037.00238.02583" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0119.0037.00238.02584" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>) were responsible</hi>. Now, it would be more <quote>candid</quote> to meet fairly our argument on this question than to give the garbled statement of it contained in the above notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>But we sincerely thank our critic for recommending our volumes to libraries at the <rs>North</rs>, feeling assured as we do that if the present generation is not prepared to do us justice their children will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>Important work was done, and <pb id="p.245" n="245"/>valuable material was collected by the <name>Society</name> in New Orleans; but its most active friends were finally led to the conclusion that its interests would be promoted by a change of domicil and of certain features of its organization.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>Accordingly the <orgName n="Executive Committee" type="committee">Executive Committee</orgName> of the <name>Society</name> issued a call for a convention of its friends to assemble at the <rs type="place">Montgomery White Sulphur Springs</rs>, Virginia, on the <dateStruct value="1873-08-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year>1873</year>,</dateStruct> and sent a communication to that convention urging that the domicil of the <name>Society</name> be changed, a new organization effected and certain alterations made in its working.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>The experience of the <rs>Committee</rs> at New Orleans had demonstrated the importance of some means of publication, and accordingly a contract was made by which the <hi rend="italics">Southern Magazine</hi> of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> was adopted as the organ of the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>After an unsatisfactory working of this arrangement (by which we published <num value="20">twenty</num> pages each month) from <dateStruct value="1874-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1874">1874</year></dateStruct>, to <dateStruct value="1875-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>, it was abandoned, and the <name>Society</name> was without an organ until <dateStruct value="1876-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1876">1876</year></dateStruct>, when we started the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName> Papers</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>The value of our collection may be seen from the simple statement that we shall be able to supply the <rs type="place">Archive Bureau</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> with many important additions to their collection.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>I heard of no such order, and feel sure no order of the kind was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>If there had been such an order, it would have been given to the skirmishers; and there would have been no necessity for such an order to them, as they would certainly fire anyway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3639"/>Even if the <rs>General</rs> had given such an order, he was not going contrary to it, as he thought there was a skirmish line in front to which he was going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>There proved to be no such line &mdash; not even a picket or a vidette &mdash; and hence the wounding of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0119.0043.00274.03112" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>His account of the whole affair shows how very erroneous are the generally received accounts; and it now appears that instead of riding to the front to reconnoitre the enemy and then imprudently galloping back towards his own line, <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0119.0043.00277.03145" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was slowly riding to the front, while making every effort to hurry forward the troops, when he was fired upon by a portion of his own men on the right (south) of the road and obliquely from the rear, and that then the horses of his party that were not shot down wheeled to the left, and he galloped into the woods on the left to escape the fire, when he was fired upon by another body of troops on the north side of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>This firing, lamentable as were its consequences, was in both instances the result of accident, or rather of that confusion inevitable in all attempts to operate with troops in the dark while they are under excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>The writer of this has perhaps been under fire as often as any man of his day, and the result of his experience and observation has been to convince him that the dangers attending offensive movements of troops in the night, especially in the forepart of the night, when the opposite side is on the alert, from mistakes or collision on the part of those taking the offensive, are not counterbalanced by any advantages likely to result; and to sustain him in this opinion he can confidently appeal to the judgment of those who have had any experience.
