<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The dark granite in many walls along our streets and in numerous house foundations is often noticed by visitors in the city and inquiry made about it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> granite was favorably known, and at the time when the polishing process came in vogue was found to lend itself to artistic work equally well with the other varieties.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Thanks to the efforts of interested and public-spirited men a great natural park is assured to the people, and the old granite quarry lies at its gateway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>As <num value="1">one</num> walks along it is simply a woodland vista that he sees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>A few steps farther and the massive head begins to assume shape; a little farther and the forehead and eyebrows appear, then the jagged rock, wind-swept, storm-beaten and sun-kissed for long years, present the aquiline nose and firmly set chin of the Old Man of the <name>Fells</name> in his impressive pose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>A dignified and restful <num value="1">one</num> it is, too, as he looks northward into the solitude and quiet of his domain, and seems like a watchful guardian of a sylvan shrine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The Old Man is seen at his best by those who take a winter walk when snow has spread a mantle of ermine over his shoulders and white robes all about him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>A summer visit may be more comfortable to make, but will lack these features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It will have the compensation, however, of bird songs, and the glinting sunlight as it plays through the quivering foliage will lovingly caress his devoted head, no longer with gray locks but many years young.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Unlike most of such weird rock sculpture, the Old Man may be viewed almost as well from the opposite direction, but at a greater distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>In recent years the modern trolley cars have come nearer him than would those earlier ones, and have met for their passing just below, with their busy human freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Few, indeed, of all the throng have ever noticed the silent figure on the hillside, or recognized his form silhouetted against the sky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/><emph>I</emph>T is a privilege to be able to say a few words relating to the beginnings of any organization that belongs to those constructive forces that make for righteousness and progress in any community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Although the narrative may have little that is picturesque in it, still it is proper and fitting that such facts as can be collected from the brief records that have been kept should be brought together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>They may not only interest those who are now concerned, but they may assist some <num value="1">one</num> who in the future may have the privilege of writing the history of the good work yet to be done, under greater opportunities, in the larger field that opens more and more widely as the years glide onward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Then, too, <num value="1">one</num> takes pleasure in giving testimony of the simple faith and sacrifice of those who were the pioneers in any movement, whose purpose was wholly altruistic, who labored that others might enjoy the fruit of their labors, and that people yet to be might enjoy greater civil or religious privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>This was made possible by the sacrifice of those whose convictions led them to believe that some way, somehow, they were fulfilling the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and thereby blessing their fellowmen.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Some churches spring into existence out of controversy, and some are evolved out of persecution, or more often are the product of some great religious movement or awakening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>In any such case, where men are strongly stirred, and where deep zeal or passion is a factor, the narrative takes on tone and color, and excites interest and attention almost without effort; but the story that is to be briefly told in this account is that of a church <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> whose life began in the quietest, most prosaic manner, with no excitement, no upheaval, and which owed its origin to no such causes, but rather to the consciousness on the part of its founders that a place convenient for the public worship of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was a necessity in the community, and that the duty of providing and maintaining such a place rested upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It will be the story of the feeble beginning of a modest little enterprise, whose originators had no vision of the future, nor anticipated the busy thoroughfares and the teeming life that was yet to cross the quiet fields in the neighborhood where they erected their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> altar and opened the doors of their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> house of prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>None of the congregation could be called wealthy, and no <num value="1">one</num> of them had an income from which much could be spared without a sacrifice, but they took hold courageously, and by the following <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> the building was framed and boarded in.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>This friendly assistance from without so inspired the local workers that they succeeded in finishing the vestry so as to make it suitable as a meeting place for the winter, and it was thus used until the main audience room was completed and the church dedicated in <dateStruct value="1890-11-"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1890">1890</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>The ship-building industry of the old days is gone, though there has recently come the building of the modern motor boats; the other famous product (no longer made) is becoming rare, the real article commanding a high price; but the old houses are well holding their own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>The subject of this sketch is not <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest, but attains the century mark this present year, and is now generally known as the <rs type="place">Mansion House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>Now in private ownership, it was at the time of its erection a public building, the <rs>Medford</rs> almshouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>The Puritan settlers of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> had little need for almshouses, for idleness was whipped out of the men by the magistrates and out of the boys by their parents; at least so says the historian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>It was not till a <measure n="160years" type="date">hundred and sixty years</measure> after the town's settlement that an almshouse was provided, and then by the purchase of a house and <measure n="3.5acres" type="area">three acres and a half</measure> of land, barely enough for a vegetable garden, as was said; and this house served for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, till it became unsuitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>This lane is now known as <address><street n="Cross street">Cross street</street></address>, and the acre and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of land is the cemetery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>The house was to be <num value="36">36</num> &times; <measure n="44feet" type="distance">44 feet</measure> in size, and with the land was to cost <measure n="4000.00dollars" type="currency">$4,000.00</measure>.

<p>
