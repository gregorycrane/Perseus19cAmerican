<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We have just been reading, with no slight degree of interest, that simple but wonderful piece of autobiography, entitled <hi rend="italics">Grace abounding to the <rs>Chief</rs> of Sinners</hi>, from the pen of the author of <hi rend="italics">Pilgrim's Progress</hi>. It is the record of a journey more terrible than that of the ideal Pilgrim; <q direct="unspecified">truth stranger than fiction;</q> the painful upward struggling of a spirit from the blackness of despair and blasphemy, into the high, pure air of Hope and Faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>More earnest words were never written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is the entire unveiling of a human heart; the tearing off of the fig-leaf covering of its sin. The voice which speaks to us from these old pages seems not so much that of a denizen of the world in which we live, as of a soul at the last solemn confessional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Shorn of all ornament, simple and direct as the contrition and prayer of childhood, when for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the <name>Spectre</name> of Sin stands by its bedside, the style is that of a man dead to self-gratification, careless of the world's opinion, and only desirous to convey to others, in all truthfulness <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> and sincerity, the lesson of his inward trials, temptations, sins, weaknesses, and dangers; and to give glory to Him who had mercifully led him through all, and enabled him, like his own Pilgrim, to leave behind the <rs type="place">Valley of the Shadow</rs> of Death, the snares of the <rs>Enchanted Ground</rs>, and the terrors of <placeName reg="Doubting Castle">Doubting Castle</placeName>, and to reach the land of <persName n="Beulah,,,,," id="n0317.0002.00011.00004" reg="mostcommon:Beulah,nomatch:0"><surname>Beulah</surname></persName>, where the air was sweet and pleasant, and the birds sang and the flowers sprang up around him, and the <rs>Shining Ones</rs> walked in the brightness of the not distant Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In the introductory pages he says: <q direct="unspecified">I could have dipped into a style higher than this in which I have discoursed, and could have adorned all things more than here I have seemed to do; but I dared not. <name n="God" type="God">God</name> did not play in tempting me; neither did I play when I sunk, as it were, into a bottomless pit, when the pangs of hell took hold on me; wherefore, I may not play in relating of them, but be plain and simple, and lay down the thing as it was.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/></p> 
<p>This book, as well as <hi rend="italics">Pilgrim's Progress</hi>, was written in <placeName reg="Bedford prison">Bedford prison</placeName>, and was designed especially for the comfort and edification of his <q direct="unspecified">children, whom <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had counted him worthy to beget in faith by his ministry.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In his introduction he tells them, that, although taken from them, and tied up, <q direct="unspecified">sticking, as it were, between the teeth of the lions of the wilderness,</q> he once again, as before, from the top of Shemer and <persName n="Hermon,,,,," id="n0317.0002.00011.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hermon,nomatch:0"><surname>Hermon</surname></persName>, so now, from the lion's den and the mountain of leopards, would look after them with fatherly care and desires for their everlasting welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><q direct="unspecified">If,</q> said <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> he, <q direct="unspecified">you have sinned against light; if you are tempted to blaspheme; if you are drowned in despair; if you think <name n="God" type="God">God</name> fights against you; or if Heaven is hidden from your eyes, remember it was so with your father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But out of all the <rs>Lord</rs> delivered me.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/></p> 
<p>He gives no dates; he affords scarcely a clue to his localities; of the man, as he worked, and ate, and drank, and lodged, of his neighbors and contemporaries, of all he saw and heard of the world about him, we have only an occasional glimpse, here and there, in his narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is the story of his inward life only that he relates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>What had time and place to do with <num value="1">one</num> who trembled always with the awful consciousness of an immortal nature, and about whom fell alternately the shadows of hell and the splendors of heaven?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We gather, indeed, from his record, that he was not an idle on-looker in the time of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s great struggle for freedom, but a soldier of the <name>Parliament</name>, in his young years, among the praying sworders and psalm-singing pikemen, the <name>Greathearts</name> and Holdfasts whom he has immortalized in his allegory; but the only allusion which he makes to this portion of his experience is by way of illustration of the goodness of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in preserving him on occasions of peril.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He was born at Elstow, in <placeName key="tgn,7008103" n="1.000 1" reg="bedfordshire,england,united kingdom,europe">Bedfordshire</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1628--"><year reg="1628">1628</year></dateStruct>; and, to use his own words, his <q direct="unspecified">father's house was of that rank which is the meanest and most despised of all the families of the land.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>His father was a tinker, and the son followed the same calling, which necessarily brought him into association <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> with the lowest and most depraved classes of <name>English</name> society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The estimation in which the tinker and his occupation were held, in the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century, may be learned from the quaint and humorous description of <persName n="Overbury,Sir,Thomas,,," id="n0317.0002.00013.00006" reg="default:Overbury,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Overbury</surname></persName>. <q direct="unspecified">The tinker,</q> saith he, <q direct="unspecified">is a movable, for he hath no abiding in <num value="1">one</num> place; he seems to be devout, for his life is a continual pilgrimage, and sometimes, in humility, goes barefoot, therein making necessity a virtue; he is a gallant, for he carries all his wealth upon his back; or a philosopher, for he bears all his substance with him. He is always furnished with a song, to which his hammer, keeping tune, proves that he was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> founder of the kettle-drum; where the best ale is, there stands his music most upon crotchets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The companion of his travel is some foul, sun-burnt quean, that, since the terrible statute, has recanted gypsyism, and is turned pedlaress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>So marches he all over <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, with his bag and baggage; his conversation is irreprovable, for he is always mending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He observes truly the statutes, and therefore had rather steal than beg. He is so strong an enemy of idleness, that in mending <num value="1">one</num> hole he would rather make <num value="3">three</num> than want work; and when he hath done, he throws the wallet of his faults behind him. His tongue is very voluble, which, with canting, proves him a linguist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He is entertained in every place, yet enters no farther than the door, to avoid suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>To conclude, if he escape <placeName reg="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> and <persName n="Banbury,,,,," id="n0317.0002.00013.00007" reg="mostcommon:Banbury,nomatch:0"><surname>Banbury</surname></persName>, he dies a beggar.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/></p> 
<p>Truly, but a poor beginning for a pious life was the youth of <persName n="Bunyan,,John,,," id="n0317.0002.00013.00008" reg="default:Bunyan,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bunyan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>As might have been <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> expected, he was a wild, reckless, swearing boy, as his father doubtless was before him. <q direct="unspecified">It was my delight,</q> says he, <q direct="unspecified">to be taken captive by the <name>Devil</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I had few equals, both for cursing and swearing, lying and blaspheming.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Yet, in his ignorance and darkness, his powerful imagination early lent terror to the reproaches of conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He was scared, even in childhood, with dreams of hell and apparitions of devils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Troubled with fears of eternal fire, and the malignant demons who fed it in the regions of despair, he says that he often wished either that there was no hell, or that he had been born a devil himself, that he might be a tormentor rather than <num value="1">one</num> of the tormented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>At an early age he appears to have married.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>His wife was as poor as himself, for he tells us that they had not so much as a dish or spoon between them; but she brought with her <num value="2">two</num> books on religious subjects, the reading of which seems to have had no slight degree of influence on his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He went to church regularly, adored the priest and all things pertaining to his office, being, as he says, <q direct="unspecified">overrun with superstition.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, a sermon was preached against the breach of the <name>Sabbath</name> by sports or labor, which struck him at the moment as especially designed for himself; but by the time he had finished his dinner he was prepared to <q direct="unspecified">shake it out of his mind, and return to his sports and gaming.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">But the same day,</q> he continues, <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>as I was in the midst of a game of cat, and having struck it <num value="1">one</num> blow from the hole, just as I was about to <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> strike it a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, a voice did suddenly dart from Heaven into my soul, which said, <quote> Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have thy sins and go to hell?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>At this, I was put to an exceeding maze; wherefore, leaving my cat upon the ground, I looked up to Heaven, and it was as if I had, with the eyes of my understanding, seen the <rs>Lord Jesus</rs> look down upon me, as being very hotly displeased with me, and as if He did severely threaten me with some grievous punishment for those and other ungodly practices.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I had no sooner thus conceived in my mind, but suddenly this conclusion fastened on my spirit, (for the former hint did set my sins again before my face,) that I had been a great and grievous sinner, and that it was now too late for me to look after Heaven; for <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0317.0002.00015.00009" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> would not forgive me nor pardon my transgressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Then, while I was thinking of it, and fearing lest it should be so, I felt my heart sink in despair, concluding it was too late; and therefore I resolved in my mind to go on in sin; for, thought I, if the case be thus, my state is surely miserable; miserable if I leave my sins, and but miserable if I follow them; I can but be damned; and if I must be so, I had as good be damned for many sins as be damned for few.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The reader of <hi rend="italics">Pilgrim's Progress</hi> cannot fail here to call to mind the wicked suggestions of the <name>Giant</name> to <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0317.0002.00015.00010" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>, in the dungeon of <placeName reg="Doubting Castle">Doubting Castle</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><q direct="unspecified">I returned,</q> he says, <q direct="unspecified">desperately to my sport again; and I well remember, that presently this kind of despair did so possess my soul, that I was <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> persuaded I could never attain to other comfort than what I should get in sin; for Heaven was gone already, so that on that I must not think; wherefore, I found within me great desire to take my fill of sin, that I might taste the sweetness of it; and I made as much haste as I could to fill my belly with its delicates, lest I should die before I had my desires; for that I feared greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In these things, I protest before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I lie not, neither do I frame this sort of speech; these were really, strongly, and with all my heart, my desires; the good <rs>Lord</rs>, whose mercy is unsearchable, forgive my transgressions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/></p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> day, while standing in the street, cursing and blaspheming, he met with a reproof which startled him. The woman of the house in front of which the wicked young tinker was standing, herself, as he remarks, <q direct="unspecified">a very loose, ungodly wretch,</q> protested that his horrible profanity made her tremble; that he was the ungodliest fellow for swearing she had ever heard, and able to spoil all the youth of the town who came in his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Struck by this wholly unexpected rebuke, he at once abandoned the practice of swearing; although previously he tells us that <q direct="unspecified">he had never known how to speak, unless he put an oath before and another behind.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/></p> 
<p>The good name which he gained by this change was now a temptation to him. <q direct="unspecified">My neighbors,</q> he says, <q direct="unspecified">were amazed at my great conversion from prodigious profaneness to something like a moral life and sober man. Now, therefore, they began to praise, to commend, and to speak well of <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> me, both to my face and behind my back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Now I was, as they said, become godly; now I was become a right honest man. But oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>when I understood those were their words and opinions of me, it pleased me mighty well; for though as yet I was nothing but a poor painted hypocrite, yet I loved to be talked of as <num value="1">one</num> that was truly godly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I was proud of my godliness, and, indeed, I did all I did either to be seen of or well spoken of by men; and thus I continued for about a twelvemonth or more.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/></p> 
<p>The tyranny of his imagination at this period is seen in the following relation of his abandonment of <num value="1">one</num> of his favorite sports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p></p> 
<p>Now, you must know, that before this I had taken much delight in ringing, but my conscience beginning to be tender, I thought such practice was but vain, and therefore forced myself to leave it; yet my mind hankered; wherefore, I would go to the steeple-house and look on, though I durst not ring; but I thought this did not become religion neither; yet I forced myself, and would look on still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But quickly after, I began to think, <quote>How if <num value="1">one</num> of the bells should fall?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Then I chose to stand under a main beam, that lay overthwart the steeple, from side to side, thinking here I might stand sure; but then I thought again, should the bell fall with a swing, it might <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hit the wall, and then, rebounding upon me, might kill me for all this beam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>This made me stand in the steeple door; and now, thought I, I am safe enough; for if a bell should then fall, I can slip out behind these thick walls, and so be preserved notwithstanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><pb id="p.18" n="18"/></p> 
<p>So after this I would yet go to see them rings but would not go any farther than the steeple-door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>But then it came in my head, <quote> How if the steeple itself should fall?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/></quote> And this thought (it may, for aught I know, when I stood and looked on) did continually so shake my mind, that I durst not stand at the steeple-door any longer, but was forced to flee, for fear the steeple should fall upon my head.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>About this time, while wandering through <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedfordshire, England" key="tgn,7011907">Bedford</placeName> in pursuit of employment, he chanced to see <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> poor old women sitting at a door, in the evening sun, and, drawing near them, heard them converse upon the things of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; of His work in their hearts; of their natural depravity; of the temptations of the <name>Adversary</name>; and of the joy of believing, and of the peace of reconciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The words of the aged women found a response in the soul of the listener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><q direct="unspecified">He felt his heart shake,</q> to use his own words; he saw that he lacked the true tokens of a Christian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He now forsook the company of the profane and licentious, and sought that of a poor man who had the reputation of piety, but, to his grief, he found him <q direct="unspecified">a devilish ranter, given up to all manner of uncleanness; he would laugh at all exhortations to sobriety, and deny that there was a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, an angel, or a spirit.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Neither,</q> he continues, <q direct="unspecified">was this man only a temptation to me, but, my calling lying in the country, I happened to come into several people's company, who, though strict in religion formerly, yet were also drawn away by these ranters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>These would also talk with me of their ways, and condemn <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> me as illegal and dark; pretending that they only had attained to perfection, that they could do what they would, and not sin. Oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>these temptations were suitable to my flesh, I being but a young man, and my nature in its prime; but <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who had, as I hope, designed me for better things, kept me in the fear of His name, and did not suffer me to accept such cursed principles.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/></p> 
<p>At this time he was sadly troubled to ascertain whether or not he had that faith which the <name>Scriptures</name> spake of. Travelling <num value="1">one</num> day from Elstow to <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedfordshire, England" key="tgn,7011907">Bedford</placeName>, after a recent rain, which had left pools of water in the path, he felt a strong desire to settle the question, by commanding the pools to become dry, and the dry places to become pools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Going under the hedge, to pray for ability to work the miracle, he was struck with the thought that if he failed he should know, indeed, that he was a castaway, and give himself up to despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>He dared not attempt the experiment, and went on his way, to use his own forcible language, <q direct="unspecified">tossed up and down between the <name>Devil</name> and his own ignorance.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/></p> 
<p>Soon after, he had <num value="1">one</num> of those visions which foreshadowed the wonderful dream of his <hi rend="italics">Pilgrim's Progress</hi>. He saw some holy people of <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedfordshire, England" key="tgn,7011907">Bedford</placeName> on the sunny side of an high mountain, refreshing themselves in the pleasant air and sunlight, while he was shivering in cold and darkness, amidst snows and never-melting ices, like the victims of the <name>Scandinavian</name> hell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>A wall compassed the mountain, separating him from the blessed, with <num value="1">one</num> small gap or doorway, through which, with <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> great pain and effort, he was at last enabled to work his way into the sunshine, and sit down with the saints, in the light and warmth thereof.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>But now a new trouble assailed him. Like <persName><foreName>Milton</foreName></persName>'s metaphysical spirits, who sat apart,<lb/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/></p><l>And reasoned of foreknowledge, will, and fate,</l></quote> he grappled with <num value="1">one</num> of those great questions which have always perplexed and baffled human inquiry, and upon which much has been written to little purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He was tortured with anxiety to know whether, according to the <name>Westminster</name> formula, he was elected to salvation or damnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>His old adversary vexed his soul with evil suggestions, and even quoted Scripture to enforce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/><q direct="unspecified">It may be you are not elected,</q> said the <name>Tempter</name>; and the poor tinker thought the supposition altogether too probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><q direct="unspecified">Why, then,</q> said Satan, <q direct="unspecified">you had as good leave off, and strive no farther; for if, indeed, you should not be elected and chosen of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, there is no hope of your being saved; for it is neither in him that willeth nor in him that runneth, but in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who showeth mercy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>At length, when, as he says, he was about giving up the ghost of all his hopes, this passage fell with weight upon his spirit: <q direct="unspecified">Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and were confounded?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Comforted by these words, he opened his Bible to note them, but the most diligent search and inquiry of his neighbors failed to discover them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>At length his eye fell upon them in the <name>Apocryphal</name> book of Ecclesiasticus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>His work was not yet done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>As soon as his health was sufficiently reestablished, he commenced the publication of an independent political and literary journal, under the expressive title of <hi rend="italics">The Plaindealer</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>A poor man, he admitted that he established the paper in the expectation of deriving from it a livelihood, but that even for that object he could not trim its sails to suit the varying breeze of popular prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>He was true to his promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>The free soul of a free, strong man spoke out in his paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>How refreshing was it, after listening to the inanities, the dull, witless vulgarity, the wearisome commonplace of journalists, who had no higher aim than to echo, with parrot-like exactness, current prejudices and falsehoods, to turn to the great and generous thoughts, the chaste and vigorous diction, of the <hi rend="italics">Plaindealer</hi>! No man ever had a clearer idea of the duties and responsibilities of a conductor of the public press than <persName n="Leggett,,William,,," id="n0317.0002.00201.00601" reg="default:Leggett,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Leggett</surname></persName>, and few have ever combined so many of the qualifications for their perfect discharge: a nice sense of justice, a warm benevolence, inflexible truth, honesty defying temptation, a mind stored with learning, and having at command the treasures of the best thoughts of the best authors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>He had his faults: his positive convictions sometimes took the shape of a proud and obstinate dogmatism; he who could so well appeal to the judgment and the reason of his readers too often only roused their passions by invective and vehement declamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>Moderate men were startled and pained by the fierce energy of his language; and he not unfrequently made implacable enemies of opponents whom he might have conciliated and won over by mild expostulation and patient explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>It must be urged in extenuation, that, as the champion of unpopular truths, he was assailed unfairly on all sides, and indecently misrepresented and calumniated to a degree, as his friend <persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n0317.0002.00202.00603" reg="nearbymention:Sedgwick,Theodore,,,"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName> justly remarks, unprecedented even in the annals of the <rs>American</rs> press; and that his errors in this respect were, in the main, errors of retaliation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>In the <hi rend="italics">Plaindealer</hi>, in common with the leading moral and political subjects of the day, that of slavery was freely discussed in all its bearings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>It is difficult, in a single extract, to convey an adequate idea of the character of the editorial columns of a paper, where terse and concentrated irony and sarcasm alternate with eloquent appeal and diffuse commentary and labored argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/></p> 
<p>What I am most afraid of is, that some of my friends, in their too earnest zeal, will place me in a false position on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>I am an Abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>I hate slavery in all its forms, degrees, and influences; and I deem myself bound, by the highest moral and political obligations, not to let that sentiment of hate lie dormant and smouldering in my own breast, but to give it free vent, and let it blaze forth, that it may kindle equal ardor through the whole sphere of my influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>I would not have this fact disguised or mystified for any office the people have it in their power to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>Rather, a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times rather, would I again meet the denunciations of <placeName reg="Tammany Hall">Tammany Hall</placeName>, and be stigmatized with all the foul epithets with which the anti-abolition vocabulary abounds, than recall or deny <num value="1">one</num> tittle of my creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>Abolition is, in my sense, a necessary and a glorious part of democracy; and I hold the right and duty to discuss the subject of slavery, and to expose its hideous evils in all their bearings,&mdash;moral, social, and political,&mdash;as of infinitely higher importance than to carry <num value="50">fifty</num> sub-treasury bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>That I should discharge this duty temperately; that I should not let it come in collision with other duties; that I should not let my hatred of slavery transcend the express obligations of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or violate its clear spirit, I hope and trust you think sufficiently well of me to believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>But what I fear is, (not from you, however,) that some of my advocates and champions will seek to recommend me to popular support by representing me as not an Abolitionist, which is false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>All that I have written <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> gives the lie to it. All I shall write will give the lie to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>And here, let me add, (apart from any consideration already adverted to,) that, as a matter of mere policy, I would not, if I could, have my name disjoined from abolitionism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>To be an Abolitionist now is to be an incendiary; as, <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, to be an anti-monopolist was to be a leveller and a <persName n="Cade,,Jack,,," id="n0317.0002.00208.00607" reg="default:Cade,Jack,,,"><foreName>Jack</foreName> <surname>Cade</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>My secluded country life has afforded me few opportunities of personal intercourse with him, while my pronounced radicalism on the great question which has divided popular feeling rendered our political paths widely divergent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>Both of us early saw the danger which threatened the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>In the language of the prophet, we <q direct="unspecified">saw the sword coming upon the land,</q> but while he believed in the possibility of averting it by concession and compromise, I, on the contrary, as firmly believed that such a course could only strengthen and confirm what I regarded as a gigantic conspiracy against the rights and liberties, the union and the life, of the nation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>With a rare and noble magnanimity, he met, without hesitation, the demand of the great occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>The poor fugitives, starving, weary, and chilled by the cold spring blasts, gazed down upon the ample fire, and the savory meats which the squaws were cooking by it, but felt no temptation to purchase warmth and food by surrendering themselves to captivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>Death in the forest seemed preferable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>They turned and fled back upon their track, expecting every moment to hear the yells of pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>The morning found them seated on the bank of a small stream, their feet torn and bleeding, and their bodies emaciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>The elder, as a last effort, made search for roots, and fortunately discovered a few ground-nuts, (<hi rend="italics">glicine apios</hi>) which served to refresh in some degree himself and his still weaker companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>The account of this tribute to the memory of departed worth cannot fail to awaken in generous hearts emotions of gratitude towards Him who has thus signally vindicated His truth, showing that the triumph of the oppressor is but for a season, and <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> that even in this world a lie cannot live forever.

<p>Will it be said, however, that this tribute comes too late; that it cannot solace those brave hearts which, slowly broken by the long agony of colonial servitude, are now cold in strange graves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>It is, indeed, a striking illustration of the truth that he who would benefit his fellow-man must <q direct="unspecified">walk by faith,</q> sowing his seed in the morning, and in the evening withholding not his hand; knowing only this, that in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> good time the harvest shall spring up and ripen, if not for himself, yet for others, who, as they bind the full sheaves and gather in the heavy clusters, may perchance remember him with gratitude and set up stones of memorial on the fields of his toil and sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>We may regret that in this stage of the spirit's life the sincere and self-denying worker is not always permitted to partake of the fruits of his toil or receive the honors of a benefactor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>We hear his good evil spoken of, and his noblest sacrifices counted as naught; we see him not only assailed by the wicked, but discountenanced and shunned by the timidly good, followed on his hot and dusty pathway by the execrations of the hounding mob and the contemptuous pity of the worldly wise and prudent; and when at last the horizon of Time shuts down between him and ourselves, and the places which have known him know him no more forever, we are almost ready to say with the regal voluptuary of old, <q direct="unspecified">This also is vanity and a great evil; for what hath a man of all his labor and of the vexation <pb id="p.425" n="425"/> of his heart wherein he hath labored under the sun?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/>Perchance, could we but lift the curtains of the narrow pinfold wherein we dwell, we might see that our poor friend and brother whose fate we have thus deplored has by no means lost the reward of his labors, but that in new fields of duty he is cheered even by the tardy recognition of the value of his services in the old. The continuity of life is never broken; the river flows onward and is lost to our sight, but under its new horizon it carries the same waters which it gathered under ours, and its unseen valleys are made glad by the offerings which are borne down to them from the past,&mdash;flowers, perchance, the germs of which its own waves had planted on the banks of Time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3362"/>Who shall say that the mournful and repentant love with which the benefactors of our race are at length regarded may not be to them, in their new condition of being, sweet and grateful as the perfume of long-forgotten flowers, or that our harvest-hymns of rejoicing may not reach the ears of those who in weakness and suffering scattered the seeds of blessing?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3363"/>The history of the <name>Edinburgh</name> reformers is no new <num value="1">one</num>; it is that of all who seek to benefit their age by rebuking its popular crimes and exposing its cherished errors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>The truths which they told <pb id="p.426" n="426"/> were not believed, and for that very reason were the more needed; for it is evermore the case that the right word when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> uttered is an unpopular and denied <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>Hence he who undertakes to tread the thorny pathway of reform&mdash;who, smitten with the love of truth and justice, or indignant in view of wrong and insolent oppression, is rashly inclined to throw himself at once into that great conflict which the <name>Persian</name> seer not untruly represented as a war between light and darkness&mdash; would do well to count the cost in the outset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>If he can live for Truth alone, and, cut off from the general sympathy, regard her service as its <q direct="unspecified">own exceeding great reward;</q> if he can bear to be counted a fanatic and crazy visionary; if, in all good nature, he is ready to receive from the very objects of his solicitude abuse and obloquy in return for disinterested and self-sacrificing efforts for their welfare; if, with his purest motives misunderstood and his best actions perverted and distorted into crimes, he can still hold on his way and patiently abide the hour when <q direct="unspecified">the whirligig of Time shall bring about its revenges;</q> if, on the whole, he is prepared to be looked upon as a sort of moral outlaw or social heretic, under good society's interdict of food and fire; and if he is well assured that he can, through all this, preserve his cheerfulness and faith in man,&mdash;let him gird up his loins and go forward in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>He is fitted for his vocation; he has watched all night by his armor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>Whatever his trial may be, he is prepared; he may even be happily disappointed in respect to it; flowers of unexpected refreshing <pb id="p.427" n="427"/> may overhang the hedges of his strait and narrow way; but it remains to be true that he who serves his contemporaries in faithfulness and sincerity must expect no wages from their gratitude; for, as has been well said, there is, after all, but <num value="1">one</num> way of doing the world good, and unhappily that way the world does not like; for it consists in telling it the very thing which it does not wish to hear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>Unhappily, in the case of the reformer, his most dangerous foes are those of his own household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3370"/>True, the world's garden has become a desert and needs renovation; but is his own little nook weedless?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3371"/>Sin abounds without; but is his own heart pure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>While smiting down the giants and dragons which beset the outward world, are there no evil guests sitting by his own hearth-stone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>Ambition, envy, self-righteousness, impatience, dogmatism, and pride of opinion stand at his door-way ready to enter whenever he leaves it unguarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>Then, too, there is no small danger of failing to discriminate between a rational philanthropy, with its adaptation of means to ends, and that spiritual knight-errantry which undertakes the championship of every novel project of reform, scouring the world in search of distressed schemes held in durance by common sense and vagaries happily spellbound by ridicule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>He must learn that, although the most needful truth may be unpopular, it does not follow that unpopularity is a proof of the truth of his doctrines or the expediency of his measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>He must have the liberality to admit that it is barely possible for the public on some points to be right and himself wrong, and that the blessing invoked <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> upon those who suffer for righteousness is not available to such as court persecution and invite contempt; for folly has its martyrs as well as wisdom; and he who has nothing better to show of himself than the scars and bruises which the popular foot has left upon him is not even sure of winning the honors of martyrdom as some compensation for the loss of dignity and self-respect involved in the exhibition of its pains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>To the reformer, in an especial manner, comes home the truth that whoso ruleth his own spirit is greater than he who taketh a city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>Patience, hope, charity, watchfulness unto prayer,&mdash;how needful are all these to his success!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>Without them he is in danger of ingloriously giving up his contest with error and prejudice at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> repulse; or, with that spiteful philanthropy which we sometimes witness, taking a sick world by the nose, like a spoiled child, and endeavoring to force down its throat the longre-jected nostrums prepared for its relief.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>He who pays his whole-hearted homage to truth and duty, who swears his lifelong fealty on their altars, and rises up a Nazarite consecrated to their holy service, is not without his solace and enjoyment when, to the eyes of others, he seems the most lonely and <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>He breathes an atmosphere which the multitude know not of; <q direct="unspecified">a serene heaven which they cannot discern rests over him, glorious in its purity and stillness.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>Nor is he altogether without kindly human sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3389"/>All generous and earnest hearts which are brought in contact with his own beat evenly with it. All that is good, and truthful, and lovely in man, whenever and wherever it truly recognizes him, must sooner or later acknowledge his claim to love and reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3390"/>His faith overcomes all things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3391"/>The future unrolls itself before him, with its waving harvest-fields springing up from the seed he is scattering; and he looks forward to the close of life with the calm confidence of <num value="1">one</num> who feels that he has not lived idle and useless, but with hopeful heart and strong arm has labored with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and Nature for the best.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>And not in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>In the economy of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, no effort, however small, put forth for the right cause, fails of its effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>No voice, however feeble, lifted up for truth, ever dies amidst the confused noises of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3395"/>Through discords of sin and sorrow, pain and wrong, it rises a deathless melody, whose notes of wailing are hereafter to be changed to those of triumph as they blend with the great harmony of a reconciled universe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3396"/>The language of a transatlantic reformer to his friends is then as true as it is hopeful and cheering: <q direct="unspecified">Triumph is certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>We have espoused no losing cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3398"/>In the body we may not join our shout with the victors; but in spirit we may even now. There is but an interval of time between us and the success at which we aim. In all other respects the links of the chain <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> are complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>Identifying ourselves with immortal and immutable principles, we share both their immortality and immutability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3400"/>The vow which unites us with truth makes futurity present with us. Our being resolves itself into an everlasting now. It is not so correct to say that we <hi rend="italics">shall be</hi> victorious as that we <hi rend="italics">are</hi> so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3411"/>It is not of them that I, a descendant of the <q direct="unspecified">sect called <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>,</q> have reason to complain in the matter of persecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3412"/>A generation which came after them, with less piety and more bigotry, is especially responsible for the little unpleasantness referred to; and the sufferers from it scarcely need any present championship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3413"/>They certainly did not wait altogether for the revenges of posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3414"/>If they lost their ears, it is satisfactory to remember that they made those of their mutilators tingle with a rhetoric more sharp than polite.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3415"/>A worthy <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> deacon once described a brother in the church as a very good man Godward, but rather hard man-ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3416"/>It cannot be denied that some very satisfactory steps have been taken in the latter direction, at least, since the days of the <name>Pilgrims</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3417"/>Our age is tolerant of creed and dogma, broader in its sympathies, more keenly sensitive to temporal need, and, practically recognizing the brotherhood of the race, wherever a cry of suffering is heard its response is quick and generous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3418"/>It has abolished slavery, and is lifting woman from world-old degradation to equality <pb id="p.432" n="432"/> with man before the law. Our criminal codes no longer embody the maxim of barbarism, <q direct="unspecified">an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,</q> but have regard not only for the safety of the community, but to the reform and well-being of the criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3419"/>All the more, however, for this amiable tenderness do we need the counterpoise of a strong sense of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3420"/>With our sympathy for the wrong-doer we need the old <rs>Puritan</rs> and <rs>Quaker</rs> hatred of wrongdoing; with our just tolerance of men and opinions a righteous abhorrence of sin. All the more for the sweet humanities and <name>Christian</name> liberalism which, in drawing men nearer to each other, are increasing the sum of social influences for good or evil, we need the bracing atmosphere, healthful, if austere, of the old moralities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3421"/>Individual and social duties are quite as imperative now as when they were minutely specified in statute-books and enforced by penalties no longer admissible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3422"/>It is well that stocks, whipping-post, and ducking-stool are now only matters of tradition; but the honest reprobation of vice and crime which they symbolized should by no means perish with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3423"/>The true life of a nation is in its personal morality, and no excellence of constitution and laws can avail much if the people lack purity and integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/>Culture, art, refinement, care for our own comfort and that of others, are all well, but truth, honor, reverence, and fidelity to duty are indispensable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>The Pilgrims were right in affirming the paramount authority of the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3426"/>If they erred in seeking that authoritative law, and passed over the <name>Sermon</name> on the <name>Mount</name> for the stern Hebraisms <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> of <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0317.0005.00433.01126" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>; if they hesitated in view of the largeness of <name>Christian</name> liberty; if they seemed unwilling to accept the sweetness and light of the good tidings, let us not forget that it was the mistake of men who feared more than they dared to hope, whose estimate of the exceeding awfulness of sin caused them to dwell upon <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> vengeance rather than his compassion; and whose dread of evil was so great that, in shutting their hearts against it, they sometimes shut out the good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3427"/>It is well for us if we have learned to listen to the sweet persuasion of the <name>Beatitudes</name>; but there are crises in all lives which require also the emphatic <q direct="unspecified">Thou shalt not</q> of the <name>Decalogue</name> which the founders wrote on the gate-posts of their commonwealth.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3439"/>The extravagance of some of the early <rs>Quakers</rs> has been grossly exaggerated.
