<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>This <hi rend="italics">chevaux de frise</hi>, it may be well to explain to the unmilitary reader, consisted of square pieces of timber of convenient length, bored through at short intervals alternately from either side of the square, and wooden spikes <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> long, sharpened at both ends, and driven halfway through these holes, so that when placed in position the ends of <num value="2">two</num> rows of spikes would rest on the ground while the ends of the other <num value="2">two</num> presented their sharp points to the front and rear at the heighth of a man's breast.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>From these little openings on either side a desultory fire was kept up, each side firing at the only vulnerable spots, which were these loopholes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>They were easily located by the smoke from the muskets, and their exact situation became known to all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>To prevent surprise in the night-time, a number of pits large enough to allow a single soldier to hide in were sunk a few yards in front of the <hi rend="italics">chevaux de frise</hi>, and after dark, pickets were sent out to occupy these pits, and keep watch for any suspicious movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>To enable them to pass in and out a few gaps were left in the <hi rend="italics">chevaux de frise</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The mortars sent their shells up into the air, leaving a trail of light behind like a rocket, and the shell descended like the stick of a rocket.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The remarkable part of this starlight encounter with the <rs>Captain</rs> is that his men did not take sides with him and shoot me down with their muskets or run me through with their bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Our being in possession of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 44" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Stedman</placeName> made the enemy's breastworks on either side and as far as the neighboring forts untenable and they were rapidly abandoned.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>The enemy's missles seemed to fall on every square yard of ground, and to sweep over the open space like the breath of the simoon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>They screeched and screamed like fiends, plowing up the ground on all sides, exploding with a sound like thunder claps, sending their fragments on errand of death and destruction in every direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>When the order was given to withdraw, I sent <num value="1">one</num> of my staff out to the skirmish line to tell the officer in charge that we were retreating and to fall back slowly, skirmishing as he returned.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>Suddenly I heard a shout, and looking in the direction of the sound, I saw a body of <orgName n="Federal Infantry" type="infantry">Federal infantry</orgName> coming over the wall of the fort on the opposite side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>A few jumps on a double-quick put the wall of the fort between the enemy and myself, and then with a few other belated stragglers I found myself crossing the stormswept space between us and our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I made progress at a tolerably lively gait, but I wore heavy cavalry boots, the ground was thawing under the warm rays of the sun, and great cakes of mud stuck to my boots; my speed slackened into a slow trot, then into a slow walk, and it seemed as if I were an hour making that <measure n="75yards" type="distance">seventy-five yards</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Not only the artillery now, but the enemy's infantry had remanned the front wall of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 44" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Stedman</placeName>, and the deadly minie balls were whistling and hurling as thick as hail.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>When I reached our works and clambered up to the top, I was so exhausted that I rolled down among the men, and <num value="1">one</num> of them expressed surprise at seeing me by remarking: <q direct="unspecified">Here is <persName n="Walker,General,,,," id="n0289.0012.00029.00354" reg="nearbymention:Walker,James,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>; I thought he was killed!</q>

<p>In this affair the <rs>Confederates</rs> lost heavily in killed, wounded and prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>In a letter from a friend and comrade, recently, a suggestion was made that I write a sketch of the organization and service of the <orgName type="regiment" key="13LARegiment">13th Louisiana Regiment</orgName> of the <name>Civil</name> war. When that command was a living, actual factor in the events of <num value="35">thirty-five</num> or <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, there were many far better qualified to record the acts and deeds of the famous old regiment than my humble self, but the eyes of most of my loved old comrades have long been closed and the pulsations of their brave hearts stilled in death, and few remain to perform the task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>Of the <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="900">nine hundred</num> gallant souls who marched from the <rs type="place">Crescent City</rs> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, there are scarcely enough now living to form a firing party at the funeral of a corporal; therefore, poorly qualified as I may be, it devolves upon me to leave a record of the battles and marches, defeats and triumphs, of a regiment as well officered and disciplined as any that served under the <name>Stars</name> and Bars, and which made a record upon the battlefield <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to none.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acquaintance with what was afterward the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 13">13th regiment</orgName>, was when, upon receiving the appointment of first lieutenant, I was ordered to report to the battalion of <rs type="role2">Governor</rs>'s Guards, better remembered as the <rs>Avegno Zouaves</rs>, camped at <placeName reg="Mandeville, Saint Tammany, Louisiana" key="tgn,2043390">Mandeville, La.</placeName></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>At the time of my appointment I was a member of the <rs>Delta Rifles</rs>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="4LAInfantry">4th Louisiana Infantry</orgName>, a company composed very largely of young sugar planters and slave-owners of parishes contiguous to <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>Wealthy, refined, gentlemanly fellows they were, those Delta Rifles, my dear reader, and you may imagine my dismay as I stepped ashore at the wharf at <placeName key="tgn,2043390" n="1.000 3" reg="mandeville, saint tammany, louisiana">Mandeville</placeName>, and cast my eyes upon as cosmopolitan a body of soldiers as there existed upon the face of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>There were Frenchmen, Spaniards, Mexicans, Dagoes, Germans, <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName>, Irishmen, and, in fact, persons of every clime known to geographers or travellers of that day. Nor was <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> that all, as it seemed to me that every soldier on the grounds, in addition to his jaunty zouave uniform, wore a black eye, a broken nose or a bandaged head, having just been recruited, and only getting over the usual enlistment spree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>In my gold-trimmed, close-fitting full-dress uniform, my young heart beat with pride and ambition as I neared my destination, but I must confess a glance at the motley crowd of soldiers caused a sigh of regret that I had left my old company, even to assume higher rank.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>I was in it, however, and putting on a bold front, pursued my way through company streets in search of headquarters to report for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>That remarks not altogether flattering were made in all modern languages, I was painfully aware; but as I did not understand much of what was said, I held my temper in check until finally <num value="1">one</num> fellow remarked to another in a rich <name>Irish</name> brogue: <q direct="unspecified">Oh, <persName><foreName>Mike</foreName></persName>, look at that new lefttenant!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>The enlisted men secured the signatures of captains when they could do so, but to save time and chances of being met by a refusal most frequently forged the names of their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>They were lively chaps, those soldiers of ours, to whom forgery of an officer's name to a pass or to a whiskey order was a small matter&mdash;a good joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>It was said parties high in authority <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> had an interest in the sutler's store, and for that reason signatures were not too closely scrutinized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>This may not have been true; but that a wonderful number of men purchased liquor on forged orders is a fact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>After a month or more spent between the banks of <placeName reg="Beaver Creek, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,1132372">Beaver creek</placeName> and the river <placeName reg="Tangipahoa, Tangipahoa, Louisiana" key="tgn,2044125">Tangipahoa</placeName> orders came to proceed to <placeName reg="Camp Chalmette">Camp Chalmette</placeName>, below New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>Officers and men alike had been anxiously expecting orders to proceed to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and were greatly disappointed at change of destination, but as any change was desirable, marching orders were hailed with intense satisfaction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>Soon after receipt of orders a reign of busy activity began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>Tents were taken down, trunks packed, blankets rolled and the regiment aligned along the railroad track to await the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>Every officer had <num value="1">one</num> trunk at least at <placeName reg="Camp Moore">Camp Moore</placeName>, but a day came when all <num value="1">one</num>'s surplus clothing was rolled in a blanket to be slung and carried over the shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>Trunks shrunk to valises, valises to hand grips and hand grips to nothing in a remarkably short time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>The train to carry the regiment and its belongings came snorting along about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> in the morning, and as soon as filled with men and camp equipage was off for the <rs type="place">Crescent City</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>Without regret, we bade farewell to the old camp in the pines, with its <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="700">seven hundred</num> graves, containing the remains of Louisianians who yielded up their patriotic young lives without having once faced the enemies of their beloved South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> single mound, however, was erected over the body of a member of the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num>, a fact which gives emphasis to the remark I often heard, that soldiers from urban communities withstand disease and hardships far better than those raised in the country, where regular hours are maintained and diseases usual to congested communities unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>To measles may be largely charged the loss of life at <placeName reg="Camp Moore">Camp Moore</placeName>, and as this disease is generally contracted in childhood by inhabitants in cities and towns, and as a great majority of our men were city bred, the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> was as nearly immune as a regiment could well be.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>After a few hours' travel, the train pulled into the old <orgName n="Jackson Railroad" type="railroad">Jackson Railroad</orgName> Depot, where an unusually animated scene presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>Nor was that the worst, for it seemed that every wife, mother or sister in the mob expected her soldier boy to accompany her home for the day. <q direct="unspecified">Oh, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, for the love of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, let <persName n="Patrick,,,,," id="n0289.0025.00113.01291" reg="mostcommon:Patrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Patrick</surname></persName> go home with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>Of course, in such a crowd of admiring patriots, with hearts overflowing with patriotism, whiskey was slipped to the boys going off to fight the battles of the country, and the liquor soon began to tell, so by the time the march began many of the soldiers were decidedly groggy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>Nevertheless enough sober and slightly intoxicated men remained with the colors to present a fine appearance as we bravely marched through <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>'s great city, cheered to the echo by crowds massed on the sidewalks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>With handsome field-officers, on gaily-prancing steeds, drum and bugle corps beating quicksteps, flashing uniforms of officers and men, the regiment presented a picture the like of which had not been witnessed in the <rs type="place">Crescent City</rs> since <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s army fought at <placeName key="tgn,2042489" n="1.000 1" reg="chalmette, saint bernard, louisiana">Chalmette</placeName>&mdash;if then.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> gross violation of civil or military law resulted from excessive drinking, however, and that was the brutal and unprovoked murder of <num value="1">one</num> soldier by another while resting in front of the <name>Mint</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>This murder was committed by a Frenchman, a member of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Company">Third Company</orgName>, called the <q direct="unspecified">Zoo-Zoos,</q> who, crazed by drink, without the least justification, raised his musket and shot and killed a German of <orgName type="company" n="Company D">Company D</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>The murderer was disarmed, arrested and turned over to the civil authorities, but it is doubtful if he was ever brought to trial, as <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> the regiment left <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> not long after, taking all witnesses to the tragedy along.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>Next morning stragglers came in by ones and twos, so that by evening roll call the regiment was itself again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>At the time of which we are writing the battle field was a stretch of smooth pasture land, well adapted for regimental manoeuvers, and, as crowds of visitors came down from the city every afternoon, it was thought well to give daily exhibitions of the proficiency of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>These drills and dress parades were no ordinary affairs, but on the most elaborate scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>Soon after daylight the division was formed along the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>There being no breakfast, little preparation was required, and disentangling ourselves from the artillery and other troops which moved out at the same time, we succeeded in gaining a clear road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>However, an hour's halt was made in the middle of the day, as well for rest as to give those few who were so provident as to have saved a little meat or flour, an opportunity to cook.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>So far we had been pursuing the road which crossed the <rs>Appomattox</rs> over <persName n="Goode,,,,," id="n0289.0028.00136.01588" reg="mostcommon:Goode,nomatch:0"><surname>Goode</surname></persName>'s bridge, but owing to the failure of <q direct="unspecified">someone</q> to have the pontoons laid at that point, we were compelled to strike further to the north, and with other troops passed over on the railroad bridge.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>At dark we commenced to file by twos across the bridge, the men being cautioned to march in the very middle of the flooring between the rails, or otherwise it might turn over.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>It was a long time before the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> had passed over, and taking a circuitous route through the woods and fields to find a suitable camping ground, we finally came to a halt a little after <time value="12am">midnight</time>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>Such particulars are here mentioned in illustration of the hardships of the retreat, for I suppose everybody fared about as well, or ill&mdash;certainly all within my observation did.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>We had been under the impression that after having placed the <rs>Appomattox</rs> in our rear we were perfectly secure from pursuit, but our eyes were now open to a real understanding of the situation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>A short distance from the <rs type="place">Courthouse</rs>, however, we halted again for a considerable time, while the whole order of march was rearranged and the column disposed as if moving through a hostile country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>Here we learned that a large portion of our wagon train had really been captured, and that the enemy in heavy force menaced our front and flank.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>During the entire day the retreat had been conducted with an absence of order which caused endless delays and irregularities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>Immediately after leaving <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> of these halts occurred, which made an unnecessrry detention of an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, and is an example of what was constantly taking place day and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>Riding ahead, with great difficulty, to ascertain the cause, I found a long train of artillery and wagons almost inextricably entangled, closed up in some places <num value="3">three</num> abreast in the road, so that a horseman even could not pass by.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>There seemed to be no <num value="1">one</num> present exercising any authority, and the teamsters appeared to be waiting stolidly for Jove to help them out. <pb id="p.138" n="138"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>Had there been an officer of authority present, or had the quartermasters, to whom the train belonged, had their hearts in the discharge of their duties at such a crisis, these and many other instances of disorder and loss of precious time might easily have been avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Never was the necessity of a well-organized corps of inspectors, with high rank and well-defined authority, so apparent as in this miserable retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>Shortly after we had managed to pass by this obstruction and obtained a tolerably clear road, the enemy were reported on our flank, and skirmishers were thrown out, but no demonstration was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>The men were now becoming exhausted and falling out in numbers, but not a ration could be anywhere procured, nor could any halt be made to give them rest and sleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>Night came and found us toiling on at a snail's pace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>Nothing is so fatiguing and demoralizing to soldiers on the march as an irregular step and uncertain halts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>About <time value="9pm">9 P. M.</time>, just as the head of the division was crossing the railroad through a deep cut, with a wood in front, the column was suddenly fired into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>A scene of the most painful confusion ensued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>Most of the men became panic-stricken, broke and sought cover behind trees or fences, while not a few skulked disgracefully to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>They began to discharge their pieces at random, in many instances shooting their own comrades, and bullets were flying from and to every direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>This lasted for a considerable time, and all efforts to restore order were unavailing, only exposing those who made such attempts to imminent danger of being shot down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>Finally, the men were induced to cease firing and partially reform their ranks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>It is believed that a small scouting party of the enemy fired into the head of the column and then hastily retired, but it is by no means certain that the panic did not wholly originate among ourselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>Just as the line was reforming, my horse started violently at seeing <persName n="Smith,Major,Frank,,," id="n0289.0028.00138.01593" reg="default:Smith,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s dead horse in the road, and this trifling incident caused a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> disgraceful panic along that part of the column.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>Warned by what had occurred before, the officers cried out earnestly: <q direct="unspecified">Don't shoot; don't shoot, men!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>But some <num value="50">fifty</num> or a <num value="100">hundred</num> guns were fired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>With a sickening feeling I saw in the moonlight a number of bright barrels pointed directly at me, and many bullets passed close by. Unable to dismount from my plunging horse, it was certainly <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> <num value="1">one</num> of the most dangerous predicaments I was placed in during the war. Finally, however, the firing ceased and order was restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>Some valuable lives were sacrificed in this inexcusable affair, including <persName n="Smith,Major,Frank,,," id="n0289.0028.00139.01594" reg="default:Smith,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>; <persName n="Pennington,,H.,C.,," id="n0289.0028.00139.01595" reg="default:Pennington,H.,C.,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Pennington</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> others killed (or mortally wounded), and half a dozen wounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>The latter had to be carried in ambulances until a house was reached, where their wounds were dressed, and the poor fellows then left to the care of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>The whole division was disheartened by this unhappy occurrence, and for some time marched on, discussing it in subdued but eager tones, presently relapsing into a gloomy silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>We marched on through the night, the men becoming more and more faint from fatigue, want of sleep, and hunger, particularly the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>Every expedient was resorted to in order to obtain rations, however scanty, with a total disregard of the ordinary rules of discipline and respect for private property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>The <rs type="role" reg="regimental-Commander">regimental commanders</rs> were instructed to send out small detachments to scour the country on either flank and bring in whatever they could lay their hands on, if only a pig, a chicken, or a quart of meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>Very little, however was procured in this way, the detachments either returning empty-handed or failing to regain the column at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>At about an hour before dawn the troops were halted in a dense thicket of old-field pine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>Most of the men immediately dropped down in their places and sank to sleep, while some few parched corn or cooked any little provision they were so lucky as to have in their haversacks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>Hunger being most pressing in my own case, I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> parched a handful of corn in a frying pan, borrowed with some difficulty, and was then preparing for a nap, when the drum beat the assembly and we took the road once more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>The morning (<dateStruct value="-04-6"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="6">6</day></dateStruct>) was damp, and the ground in bad condition for marching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>In disentangling the division from various other commands which blocked the road, the battalion lately commanded by <persName n="Smith,Major,Frank,,," id="n0289.0028.00139.01596" reg="default:Smith,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> became separated and did not join us again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>We soon got ahead of the other troops; but the road was occupied by an immense train of wagons, ambulances, etc., and so we marched by the side of it. By this time the command was fearfully reduced in numbers, and men were falling out continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>They were allowed to shoot from their places in the ranks pigs, chickens, <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> or whatever of the sort came in their way, commanding officers and inspectors looking on without rebuke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>It was, perhaps, the only instance in my experience during the war when the plea of military, or rather of human, necessity imperatively overruled all consideration due to private property and military discipline.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>These calculations, however, are made from memory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>But when all the circumstances are taken into consideration, never was exhibited more patient fortitude and fidelity than in this wreck of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>About midday the road, <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile in advance of <orgName n="column"><persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n0289.0028.00140.01598" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,Richard,S.,,:2"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s column</orgName>, was suddenly threatened by the enemy's cavalry, which made an effort to strike the wagon train there filing by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>Just at this point the road divided, <num value="1">one</num> branch keeping a little to the left, the other at the same angle to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>The wagon train pursued the right hand branch, while the troops took the left, thus covering the train from the enemy, whose attack was made from that side.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>Having been at this point already some time before our division came up, I informed my general (<persName n="Lee,,Custis,,," id="n0289.0028.00140.01606" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>) that I had distinctly seen large bodies of the enemy mount and pass on to our right, with the evident intention of gaining a position across the road in front of our line of march, while a force still remained to threaten and delay us, and asked if we could not destroy or abandon the remainder of the wagon train and push by that road ourselves; but his orders required him strictly to wait for the passing of the train and to guard it afterwards by taking the lefthand road; and I think I remember his receiving renewed orders to the same effect just at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>The enemy now opened upon us with <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery, shelling <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> the wagon train more particularly, which was hurried by as fast as possible; but about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> were so consumed before the last wagon passed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>When we met together this time last year we were busy with the discussion of plans for its unveiling; to-day we look in retrospect upon the successful completion of every detail of that ceremony from inception to finish, and if any reward were needed to repay us for the labor and anxiety concurrent with the raising of the fund and the choosing of the design and site, I think we have it when, our footsteps being drawn like the needle to the pole, we pause before the consummation of our dearest hopes and view with enraptured gaze this memorial, the magnificent result of years of indomitable work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>And the sweetest thought to me, and I am sure to all of us, is this that we did it all ourselves; it was our own unaided work of love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>Through some lack in our system, the fruits of our struggle and sacrifices have invariably slipped away from us and left us nothing but long lists of dead and mangled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>Instead of standing defiantly on the borders of our territory, or harrassing those of the enemy, we are hemmed in to-day into less than <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of it, and still the enemy menacingly confronts us at every point with superior forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>Our soldiers can see no end to this state of affairs except in our own exhaustion; hence, instead of rising to the occasion, they are sinking into a fatal apathy, growing weary of hardships and slaughters, which promise no results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>In this state of things it is easy to understand why there is a growing belief that some black catastrophe is not far ahead of us, and that unless some extraordinary change is soon made in our condition we must overtake it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>If this state continues much longer we must be subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>Every man should endeavor to understand the meaning of subjugation before it is too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>We can give but a faint idea when we say it means the loss of all we now hold most sacred&mdash;slaves and all other personal property, lands, homesteads, liberty, justice, safety, pride, manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>Wherever slavery is once seriously disturbed, whether by the actual presence or the approach of the enemy, or even by a cavalry raid, the whites can no longer with safety to their property openly sympathize with our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/>All along the lines slavery is comparatively valueless to us for labor, but of great and increasing worth to the enemy for information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/>It is an omnipresent spy system, pointing out our valuable men to the enemy, revealing our positions, purposes, and resources, and yet acting so safely and secretly that there is no means to guard against it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>Apart from all other aspects of the question, the necessity for more fighting men is upon us. We can only get a sufficiency by making the negro share the dangers and hardships of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>It is politic besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>For many years&mdash;ever since the agitation of the subject of slavery commenced&mdash;the negro has been dreaming of freedom, and his vivid imagination has surrounded that condition with so many gratifications that it has become the paradise of his hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>To attain it he will tempt dangers and difficulties not exceeded by the bravest in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>The hope of freedom is, perhaps, the only moral incentive that can be applied to him in his present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>It would be preposterous, then, to expect him to fight against it with any degree of enthusiasm; therefore, we must bind him to our cause by no doubtful bonds; we must leave no possible loophole for treachery to creep in. The slaves are dangerous now, but armed, trained, and collected in an army they would be a thousandfold more dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>Therefore, when we make soldiers of them we must make freemen of them beyond all question, and thus enlist their sympathies also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>We can do this more effectually than the <rs>North</rs> can now do, for we can give the negro not only his own freedom, but that of his wife and child, and can secure it to him in his old home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>To do this we must immediately make his marriage and parental relations sacred in the eyes of the law and forbid their sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>The past legislation of the <rs>South</rs> concedes that a large <pb id="p.226" n="226"/> free middle class of negro blood, between the master and slave, must sooner or later destroy the institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>Satisfy the negro that if he faithfully adheres to our standard during the war he shall receive his freedom and that of his race; give him as an earnest of our intentions such immediate immunities as will impress him with our sincerity and be in keeping with his new condition; enroll a portion of his class as soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and we change the race from a dread weakness to a position of strength.</p></div1>

<p>In chronicling the events of the late war, many points in regard to campaigns, battles and adventures have been ably touched upon by active participants in the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, but how the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier lived and contrived for partial comfort in the last <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>'s existence has not as yet been touched upon in small details which show the actual state of hardship he had to endure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>The most vulnerable point of the private soldier was his stomach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>He managed to get along very well in rags and tatters, half shoeless, if necessary; but with a pinched stomach many as brave and true soldiers as the world ever produced felt their love and cause of country gradually succumb to the cravings of hearty digestive organs, their patriotism taxed, and in evil, disgraceful hour they left their standards, turned their backs upon comrades and past glories, and <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> singly or in bodies went over to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>Many of these men enlisted in the <rs>Federal</rs> army as teamsters, or stipulated to fight the <name>Indians</name> in the far <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>Whilst they would desert their cause in its extremity they were honorable (?) enough not to fire upon their former comrades.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>Writing from a personal knowledge, those who left us were mainly of foreign birth, though many of our foreign-born comrades remained as true as steel to their adopted government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>The principal cause of this great and disturbing evil was the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">Commissary Department</orgName>, as managed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>Just where the fault lay is hard to divine&mdash;whether with the department in general, or with the wretched railway and other transportation facilities, or all combined, is not germane to this now, but the fact is potent that the line did thus suffer, and in suffering, the cause collapsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>All the arts and resources of the <rs>North</rs> in men and war material never affected the private soldier of the line as did the lack of his rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>To him the sounds of strife brought visions of full haversacks, warm clothing, shoes and blankets when the field was won. Often in the thickest of the fray it was not uncommon to see the soldier grasp a haversack from the ground or displace it from a dead enemy, and quickly swing it to his shoulder, and its contents shared with others at the close of the action if he survived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>As to how we lived, <hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., eked out an existence on scant grub, I will try to pen in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/><measure n="3years" type="date">Three years</measure> of warfare, notwithstanding the many brilliant but barren victories that perched upon the battleflags of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, had well-nigh exhausted the <rs>South</rs>, both in soldiers and supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>Of the depleted ranks we speak not, for the disciplined armies yielded only to physical causes, not force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>Active Federal cavalry had curtailed the resources of the <rs>South</rs> to a great extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>Its granaries in the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> were overrun and devastated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>The torch completed what was not consumed, and barns, vehicles and implements were destroyed, so as to prevent even an attempt at a crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/>The boast was made that over some of its sections <q direct="unspecified">a crow could not fly without carrying rations.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>Dilapidated railways and wheezy steamboats that presaged death and disaster, were inadequate to supply the demand of the armies and trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/>When a railroad was badly damaged, it was seldom repaired, for we had not the material to repair it with, and, for sake of protection, governmental restrictions were thrown around them, limiting the speed to <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> only <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> per hour, and it took a nervy crew, indeed, to run a steamboat on Southern inland waters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>In the month of <dateStruct value="1864-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, I came on furlough from the front at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg, Va.</placeName>, passing through <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, walking many, many miles, as the trains were then in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, laden with the wounded from the front of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0289.0041.00239.02691" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>A survey of the country in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, as glimpsed from the railroad, showed nothing but pine wastes and resin piled at rotten depots.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 14" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName> much push and stir was evidenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>Abundant crops greeted the eye, and all along the line of railway to <placeName key="tgn,2003293" n="1.000 35" reg="demopolis, marengo, alabama">Demopolis</placeName>, on the <rs>Tombigbee</rs>, the same cheering features existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>On both banks of the <placeName key="tgn,2724652" n="1.000 20" reg="tombigbee river, united states">Tombigbee</placeName> vast heaps of corn, racked and cribbed, were to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>I wondered at the sight of so much provender for man and beast exposed to wind and weather, and rotting daily in the summer sun. These were neighborhood collections of <q direct="unspecified">tax in kind,</q> a necessary feature of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>These immense piles of corn, if speedily transported to the front, would have given new lease of life to our troops and restored the wasted strength of our animals, but we had no transportation facilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>Cotton was scarcely cultivated, except in the remote districts free from raids of Federal cavalry, and even of our own troops, who generally, under orders, burned all they could find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>Field peas, sweet potatoes, peanuts and melons varied the aspect of the fields, and I longed for peace, sweet peace, to come, so that I, too, could once more enjoy the bountiful harvest that looked so tempting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>Here I bought a small watermelon for a <num value="1">one</num>-dollar bill, and thought what a time I would have with it. I even refused, in my selfishness, to divide with a forlorn soldier, and found that, from a long-enforced contraction of the stomach, I could not devour <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of it, and, in disgust, pitched the remainder to a cow near-by.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>After this digression that gives to some degree an inside view of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, I resume the thread of a soldier's life in the <pb id="p.240" n="240"/> trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>Our enlistment was for the war, and the pay $1T per month, board and bedding free; services, anything your officers said had to be done, from shooting <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> and getting shot, to starving to death, almost; in a word, to obey any and all orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>This was done with the best grace possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>The events of a gigantic struggle rolled on; shooting and getting shot was endured (when it didn't kill); our wages&mdash;at least mine were paid up to <dateStruct value="1864-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, for I signed away my pay roll at <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta, Ga.</placeName>, for clothing&mdash;were sometimes paid in Confederate notes, hut they had little value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>Eloquently it has been said of them: <q direct="unspecified">Worthless as were these <quote>promises to pay,</quote> they cost more than any tender ever issued by a nation on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>They were issued in integrity, defended in valor, and bathed in priceless blood.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/><orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> was&mdash;</p> <lg type="pentameter"> <l>Too poor to possess the precious ores,</l> <l>And too much of a stranger to borrow,</l> <l>We issued to-day our promise to pay,</l> <l>And hoped to redeem on the morrow;</l> <l>But the faith that was in us was strong, indeed,</l> <l>And our poverty well we discerned;</l> <l>And this little check represented the pay</l> <l>That our suffering veterans earned.</l> <l>We knew it hardly had a value in gold,</l> <l>Yet as gold each soldier received it;</l> <l>It gazed into our eyes with a promise to pay,</l> <l>And each Southern patriot believed it.</l> <l>But our boys thought little of price or of pay,</l> <l>Or of bills that were overdue;</l> <l>We knew that if it brought us our bread to-day,</l> <l>'Twas the best our poor country could do.</l></lg> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>Campaigns waxed hotter and hotter, paymasters became scarcer and scarcer, and the commissariat rapidly followed suit; in fact, evolved itself down to sheer nothing, and in thus contracting, the vitality of the army contracted also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>Our rations were reduced to the minimum of <num value="1">one</num>-quarter of a pound of salt meat, or <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of beef, <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of flour, or <num value="1">one</num> pint of meal <hi rend="italics">per diem</hi>. Coffee and sugar were luxuries, and what little we had was gotten from some victorious field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>This we eked out with parched cornmeal and sweetened it sometimes with <q direct="unspecified">long sweetening,</q> <hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., sorghum molasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>This syrup, if used in other form than cooking would work you like a <q direct="unspecified">flywheel.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>Our flour rations we utilized in its most convenient form for bread, to-wit, <q direct="unspecified">pancake.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>Having but few cooking utensils, we took turn about in baking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>We mixed the <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> batter up in the skillet, or perhaps on a corner of a tent fly, seasoning it with a bit of dirty salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>Our meat was too scarce to fry out any for grease, hence salt and water were the only components of our bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>We did not even have soda.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>I have seen leached ashes tried as a substitnte; except as to color, it was a dismal failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/>This form of bread we called <q direct="unspecified">short bread,</q> presumably because it was short of every ingredient necessary for good bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/>I have seen the dough wrapped around ramrods and toasted brown; also encased in wet shucks and baked in hot embers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/><num value="1">One</num> campaign we marched far ahead of the wagons, and at night as <num value="1">one</num> of a detail was sent back to cook rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>Were we puzzled?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>Not a bit. We went to work and made up a big batch of dough on a tent cloth; next we wrenched a wide plank from a neighboring fence, duly cleaned it, and then placed a dozen or so batches of kneaded dough upon the plank, and then gradually inclined the plank so as to catch the full heat of the coals, and there propped it to brown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/>When sufficiently browned, we turned the cakes over and repeated the process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>Thus, by a little ingenuity, we had our bread baked by the time the wagons arrived with the camp utensils, and all we had to do was to boil the beef and distribute the rations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>The latter part of the war we had no hard tack, flour and meal being issued dry. This did well enough in camp, but on the march we frequently lost it by rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>When we had hard tack&mdash;a form of bread baked very hard and dry, and issued as part of rations&mdash;and later on stale light bread, we knew how to utilize them to the best advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>We would break it into bits, put it into a cup of water, season with a pinch of salt and wee bit of meat, and then boil it <q direct="unspecified">tender.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>The boiling increased the quantity of the mess, apparently, and when done we enjoyed this dish, the soldiers' friend, surnamed <q direct="unspecified">cush.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>I lately saw some soldier lines dedicated to this dish, the author evidently having often made of it a substantial meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>With meal, good, bad or indifferent, we had our bane when the march came with <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>In camp we made flapjacks or mush, and parched some of it for coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>When cooked into pones, it readily mildewed and soured; besides, it was bulky and bothered <num value="1">one</num> no little to carry along with other camp accoutrements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>Even if soured, we, perforce, had to use it best we may, for it was <q direct="unspecified">our all in all.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>In winter quarters of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">65</year></dateStruct> we had brigade bake ovens, and light bread was issued in lieu of flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>For awhile we enjoyed it, but as soon as it became stale we tired of it as a nuisance, and preferred our <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/><num value="3">Three</num> loaves of this <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> bread, weighing nearly <measure n="2l." type="pounds"><num value="2">two</num> pounds</measure> each, issued to a soldier on the eve of a march down the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>, or across the country to head a cavalry raid, was a positive burden and nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>Not having knapsacks and haversacks that would turn snow or sleet, it would get wet, then musty and unfit to eat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>Salt meat, when issued, was generally used raw as more economical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/><measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">One</num> pound</measure> of beef, poor, skinny, onion-flavored stuff, was poor rations, but we made out on it. We utilized the butcher pens to the fullest extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>The head, feet, liver, hoofs, sweetbreads and even the melt were eagerly sought for, and bought if not purloined, and the possessor envied his happy lot. The feet were boiled to pieces, picked clear of bones, strained through a rough, improvised sieve, then seasoned, mixed with flour and fried with tallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>We thought <q direct="unspecified">cow hoofs</q> were a delicacy indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>On several occasions extract of beef in large <num value="12">twelve</num>-pound cans was issued as rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/><num value="1">One</num> spoonful <num value="3">three</num> times a day was issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>We found it pleasant and wholesome, added to flour paste and cooked.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>More likely it was discarded ship's pork or <q direct="unspecified">salt junk;</q> some called it salt horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>It was of a peculiar scaly color, spotted like <num value="0.5">a half</num>-well case of smallpox, full of a rancid odor and utterly devoid of grease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>If hung up it would double its length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3358"/>It could not be eaten raw and imparted a stinking smell when boiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3359"/>It had <num value="1">one</num> redeeming quality&mdash;elasticity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3360"/>You could put a piece in your mouth and chew it for a long time, and the longer you chewed the bigger it got. Then, by a desperate effort, you would gulp it down, <q direct="unspecified">out of sight, out of mind.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/></p> 
<p>We ransacked old fields for beans that had fallen out of the pods in harvesting, and frequently, after a hard shower, a good mess could be gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3362"/>Poke-weed was used as <q direct="unspecified">greens;</q> in fact, anything green and palatable was eagerly sought for.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3363"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> our division took position in the trenches at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> near the lead works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>In a few days thereafter we were agreeably surprised by receiving a large lot of vegetables, compliments of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA49">49th Virginia</orgName> to our brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>It <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> was a hearty token of soldierly regard to an <q direct="unspecified">orphan brigade</q> from a remote Gulf State, cut off from home and supplies, and was greatly appreciated by all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>Soap, even, became a luxury, and was hard to get, except when in proximity to the <rs>Federal</rs> lines, where we could readily exchange for it tobacco, which was issued as rations to us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>It answered well enough in dry weather, but drew myrads of flies to our feet.

<p>Passing through a farmyard we saw a large pot full of boiled turnips, corn and shucks for cattle and hog feed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>While it did not look so tempting, it smelled appetizing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>Yielding to our appetites, we dipped in our tin cups and drew up some of the mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>The soft corn was real good, and, stripping the turnips of the peel, we found a savory meal indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>Filling our empty haversacks with the soft-boiled corn, we soon overtook our messmates and divided our find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>Next day we crossed a turnip patch concealed in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/>Nothing daunted, we spread a blanket on the ground and made a long row of turnips, <num value="3">three</num> high, on it, wrapping carefully the blanket around the pile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>Pinning it securely with skewers of wood we then gave the whole a twist, tied the ends, then swung it to <num value="1">one</num> of our rifles and started for camp, determined to <q direct="unspecified">do or die.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>This load consisted of <num value="124">124</num> turnips, <num value="2">two</num> rifles and accoutrements, ammunition, <num value="2">two</num> knapsacks, <num value="1">one</num> peck of peas, <num value="1">one</num> ax, <num value="2">two</num> haversacks, etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>About <time value="3pm">3 P. M.</time> it suddenly dawned upon my comrade that he was that day in charge of the company's ax, and its delay or absence involved a serious punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>Finally he took the peas, ax and both knapsacks and set off for the probable camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>The turnips were a load in themselves, and I soon found it becoming a burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/><num value="1">One</num> of my shoes rubbed my heel sore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>I cut a hole in it, and that made it worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>I finally cut the whole heel out, and then it wouldn't stay on; so, pulling it off, I trudged along in wet and cold, and was soon overcome with a chill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3389"/>I lay down by the lonely roadside to await <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3390"/>About sundown the largest drove of wild turkeys I ever saw flew by and alighted on the pines overhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3391"/>I sprang to my feet and tried my best to shoot <num value="1">one</num>, but failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>The exercise restored my circulation, and I again plodded on to camp, which I reached about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, and, under cover of a good fire, I slept the sleep of the just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>My comrade, for getting into camp late, was put back in the ranks, and I still had my load to carry or give it up. Wearily I went on, and about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from winter quarters our regimental surgeon, in his ambulance, overtook me. I never saw a more surprised man in my life, and his exclamation, <q direct="unspecified">What in the world have you got there, <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>rang out with a laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3395"/>I told him all about it, and he kindly let me put the turnips in his ambulance and delivered them to my messmates in camp, and for a long time we feasted on roasted turnips.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3396"/>I cite this to show the endurance of a boy soldier, half-starved, barefooted and sick, yet swinging like grim death to a load ample for a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>I have seen men frequently eat <num value="1">one</num> day's rations at once, saying <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">one</num> good bite is better than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> pinched ones.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3398"/></p> 
<p>Our shoes, especially those made by the <rs>Confederate</rs> department, were pitiable specimens indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>Generally made of green or at best half-cured leather, they soon took to roaming; after a week's wear the heel would be on the side, at an angle to the foot, and the vamp, in turn, would try to do duty as a sole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3400"/>It was impossible to keep them straight, and to judge by your tracks you could hardly tell whether you were going or coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3401"/>They conformed to the weather also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3402"/>While hot and dry they would shrink like parchment, and when wet they just <q direct="unspecified">slopped</q> all over your feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3403"/>English-made shoes were nearly as bad. They were lined and filled with stiff paper, and after fording a few times they usually came to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3404"/>I have seen men while in winter quarters take a piece of beef hide, soak it well and then fit it over their shoes, hair part inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3405"/>These they allowed to dry on the feet, so as to retain the shape of the foot, and also to prevent contracting too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3406"/>When well made, they answered the purpose very well, and when the march came in the spring of the year they would cut them off and they would have a well-broke new shoe to trudge the pike with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3407"/>Socks were patched at heels and toes to save wear, as were our trousers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3408"/>It was a common sight to see all sorts of re-enforcements to the men's seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3409"/>On a pair of brown or butternut-colored trousers you would see a huge heart, square or star-shaped patch, according to the whim of the <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3410"/>Our hats and caps were taken from <q direct="unspecified">our friends, the enemy,</q> and you could see all styles, shapes and makes, generally ornamented with letters denoting the command of the owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3411"/>The <q direct="unspecified">alpine hat</q> or <q direct="unspecified">Excelsior,</q> of New York, was the most common, and were preferred to all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3412"/>Caps were not sought after, as they neither turned sun nor rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3413"/>Slouch hats are peculiar to the <rs>South</rs>, and were affected a great deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3414"/>We also had palmetto, pine straw and quilted cloth hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3415"/>At <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> our captain went up to, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and purchased some <num value="30">thirty</num>-odd hats for his company, paying for the same <measure n="90dollars" type="currency">ninety dollars</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3416"/><q direct="unspecified">Oh, what a swell we did cut.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3417"/>They were a drab color, and took well as long as the weather was fine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3418"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rain took out all pretension of style, and in place of a neat, nobby-looking hat, we were the possessors of a limp mass of rabbit fur and glue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3419"/>When the sun shone out the hats, in spite of all contrary efforts, dried to suit themselves, and cracked when again pressed into shape, and before long drooped again and fell to pieces as we trudged the ways of the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3420"/>Our buttons were made of wood, and soon parted company with our wretched garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3421"/>In camp we boiled our underwear in the mess kettle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3422"/>A good boiling of our clothes twice a month got rid of the vermin, but enough was always left for spring seed, for you could not get all the men to clean up at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3423"/>On the long march, not having time to boil, and our body servants having unlimited rations, increased rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/>To find some comfort we would, where an opportunity offered, strip off and hunt them with fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>The usual and most effective way was to heat the end of a stick into coal, and with this run it up and down the several seams of your garments until all were destroyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3426"/>A favorite yarn of the times runs thus: <q direct="unspecified">A soldier was seated by the wayside, shirt off, busily hunting the vermin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3427"/>A farmer passing by stopped and watched the operation for awhile, and then exclaimed: <quote><rs type="role2">Mister</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3428"/>Be those fleas you are killing?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3429"/>With wrathful mien, the soldier responded: <quote>Say, you look here, do you think I am a dog?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3430"/>No, sir; these be lice.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3431"/></q> These clothes being always of heavy and coarse material, always dried rough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>To obviate the disagreeable feeling and to prevent chafing, we rubbed them around smooth-barked saplings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>On the winter marches we fared wretchedly, for our clothing was not <q direct="unspecified">overly warm,</q> nor was it material that would turn water readily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3434"/>When we got into camp we were soon comfortable before huge fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3435"/>When we <q direct="unspecified">retired</q> it was on the side of the fire over which the smoke curled, as affording us more warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3436"/><pb id="p.246" n="246"/> On the march once near <placeName reg="Culpeper Courthouse">Culpeper Courthouse</placeName>, we tried a plan suggested by <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0289.0041.00246.02694" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> and never repeated it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3437"/>We built a large fire and allowed it to burn down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3438"/>We then raked it off clean, spread some pine straw, on this a blanket, and, wrapped in another blanket, we slept like a top; in fact, too warm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3439"/>We sweltered, and next day had violent influenza, and suffered acutely.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3440"/>In the absence of <rs n="pocket handkerchiefs" type="product">pocket handkerchiefs</rs> we had to slip our nose on our rough coat sleeves, which soon produced an inflamed organ, rivaling <persName n="Barleycorn,,John,,," id="n0289.0041.00246.02695" reg="default:Barleycorn,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Barleycorn</surname></persName> in that respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3441"/>Our clothes, mostly cotton, were coarse and heavy, and of every hue and cut&mdash;not a full uniform of <num value="1">one</num> material except those of the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3442"/>The prevailing color was what is familiarly known as <q direct="unspecified">butternut,</q> a dry dye made from copperas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3443"/>Its commonness gave rise to the nickname of <q direct="unspecified">butternuts</q> to the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3444"/>Our shelters, when in winter quarters, were varied, distinct and original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3445"/>We had the <q direct="unspecified">dug out,</q> the thatched arbor-shaped dog kennel, a log pen opened at <num value="1">one</num> end, chimney at the other, and covered with tent flys, or riven boards, and these frequently heaped with earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/>The double cabin or hut was the <num value="1">one</num> most preferred, and was large enough to shelter <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> men. This was built with a brick and mud chimney at each end. When properly chinked and daubed, and well covered, it was very comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3447"/>As the fireplace was ample we put on huge back logs and defied the worst of weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3448"/>Very little bedding sufficed in these huts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3449"/>Many of the soldiers would, on the summer's march, throw away their blankets and superfluous clothing, trusting to luck to provide others ere winter set in. Often failing in this they had to resort to such as they could get&mdash;bed quilts or pieces of carpet, which, as soon as they became wet through, trebled in size and weight, and were finally thrown away as too cumbersome even for the frail comfort they afforded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3450"/>The latter part of the war in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and, I suppose, everywhere else, was often characterized with wretched battle scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3451"/>I have seen hundreds of dead Federals, and many Confederates, too, stripped of every vestige of clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3452"/>Even the wounded were robbed of their outer clothing sometimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3453"/>No matter if the underwear was soaked with life-blood, reeking with vermin and the filth of a long campaign, it was readily taken and used, because needed, and beat none badly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>This robbery of the gallant dead was not done as a desecration, but on the ground of personal suffering and need of the living, and the plea was advanced that the garment was of no further service to the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3455"/>It seems barbarous and terrible <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> that the brave who fell in defense of their cause should thus be maltreated, but it is claimed that the exigencies of the times palliated it to some extent, even if it did not justify it altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3456"/>Even the <rs>Confederate</rs> dead, clad in his wretched raiment, fared but little better if friends were not near to prevent it. It is easily seen by whom these ghastly trophies were sought and obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3457"/>Such ghouls belong to all armies, and are the dread of the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3458"/>The character of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier, those to the manner born, in every detail of the war, was above reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3459"/>They never robbed the living nor stripped the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3460"/>They endured personal suffering and misery in preference to the use of such vile means of obtaining comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3461"/>Brave, gallant and chivalrous; generous at all times, either in victory or defeat, the instinct of their breeding showed forth in most conspicuous forms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3462"/>History records that in all countries and communities, and nowhere oftener shown up than in armies, is an element&mdash;a disturbing <num value="1">one</num>&mdash;who bring upon their associates odium and reproach by overt acts, which condemn all as a whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3463"/>For these we can offer no excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3464"/>As they were for us and with us, we must be content to abide the sequence of circumstances beyond our control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3465"/>We shared their glory, for many of them were brave as the bravest, as far as that goes, and can but disclaim personal participation only.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/>In conclusion, such was the way the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier lived and fared; how with rifles and bayonets bright as sunbeams he fought the world knows how, and when the starry-cross battle flag was furled in defeat by starvation and privation, he returned to a ruined home and sought to build anew his fortunes, and again suffered the hardships incidental thereto with the same enduring patience and fortitude he displayed as a soldier, and to-day his proudest boast is: <q direct="unspecified">I was a Confederate soldier and fought with <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0289.0041.00247.02696" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0289.0041.00247.02697" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:6"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0289.0041.00247.02698" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:1"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3467"/>I have nothing to be ashamed of while in the ranks, and now, under the flag under which I was born, I allow none to surpass me in loyalty and allegiance to a reunited country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3468"/>Our bonnie blue flag is furled in defeat&mdash;a defeat that reflects honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>This party is to-day the most distinctly defined and the most dangerous to us. Its <rs type="role" reg="chief-Representative">chief representatives</rs> are the historians against whose work we are especially engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3653"/>The other purpose, and for this especially they are laboring, is to have it believed that the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier, however brave, was actuated by no higher motive than the desire to retain the money value of his slave property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>They rightly believed that the world once convinced of this, will hold us degraded, rather than worthy of honor, and that our <pb id="p.264" n="264"/> children, instead of reverencing their fathers, will be secretly, if not openly, ashamed of them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/></p> 
<p>The report then reviews certain publications of <num value="1">one</num> of the most learned and forceful writers of the <rs>North</rs>, and points out with clearness and conclusiveness the errors of statement as to facts in our history which are beyond dispute, and which can be accounted for only by the blindness of sectional prejudice which disfigures the otherwise admirable work of that learned writer.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>Thus briefly and crudely enough we have reviewed some of the grounds on which this man's wide and brilliant reputation is founded, and which, in the estimation of his people, entitle him to this earthly crown.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>But his words and his works are not of themselves the man; indeed, they but dimly and most inadequately disclose the vast powers, the infinite variety and the ineffable charm of his mind and character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>He was primarily a veracious man, not in his written and spoken words alone, but in every instinct of his nature, in every impulse of his lofty soul, in every act of his noble life, as in all the varied expressions of his countenance the truth was the distinguishing feature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>Deceit and guile had no place in his heart, but candor in thought and sentiment, and frankness in his declarations was his typical characteristic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>Simplicity in the operations of his mind, in the exercise of his soul, and in the conduct of his life was <num value="1">one</num> of the sources of his unfailing success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>Courage of that pure and exalted type which is unconscious of self, and of that quality which grows in strength as the danger which confronts it thickens and continues; that courage which has its sanction in purity of heart, in unselfishness of aim and elevation of purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>His soul was never daunted by the suddenness or the extremity of peril, and his eye never quailed before the face of mortal <pb id="p.265" n="265"/> man. It is in this feature of his character that we may find the power which sustained him in the projection and in the ultimate achievement of those important movements which, throughout his life, he inaugurated for the advancement of his profession and for the alleviation of the wants and sufferings of humanity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>In his intellectual life the qualities of which we have spoken played a conspicuous part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>Singleness of aim, simplicity of methods, and unswerving devotion to his object will account for much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>His mind was never clouded by misty speculations, but in all its operations it was guided by a knowledge which he believed to be accurate and sufficiently full for the object sought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>His perceptions were clear and vigorous, never distorted by passion or perverted by prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>His impressions were always thoroughly digested and his reflections were free and candid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>His conclusions were often reached with a rapidity that appeared to be instinctive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>They were honestly formed, and not lightly surrendered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>It was these qualities and habits of mind that in large measure imparted to his social conversation and his more formal narrations that lucidity of style, that graphic delineation of character or incident, which so charmed his listeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/>But intellect alone never wins the love of men, it makes no appeal to the affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>History holds no record of any man crowned as a hero by virtue of his intellect alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>Intellect never swayed senates or led confiding legions to victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>Those faculties of the soul which constitute character are the potential factors in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>It is the character of man that commands our confidence and controls our affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3678"/>It is that which most essentially distinguishes <num value="1">one</num> man from another and fixes for each man his place and power in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>A man's impulsive words and acts, the unpremeditated and instinctive expressions of his aspirations and desires, these disclose the real man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3680"/>It was by these that <persName n="McGuire,,Hunter,,," id="n0289.0042.00265.02783" reg="default:McGuire,Hunter,,,"><foreName>Hunter</foreName> <surname>McGuire</surname></persName> was made more clearly known, and it is by these that his image is most deeply graven on the fleshly tablets of human hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3681"/>His claims to greatness rest upon the fact that in all the manifestations of his personal character he was great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3682"/>The scope of his moral vision was broad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3683"/>He was magnanimous, no petty piques or prejudices or resentments disturbed the serenity of his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3684"/>He harboured no revenge, nor bore malice to any. His charity was broad; the weak, the helpless, the poor and the friendless were the objects of his tender care, on whom, without stint, he expended of his time and substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3685"/>No open record may exist on earth of that vast multitude whose racking <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> bodies found relief or their anxious hearts found solace in the retirement of St. Luke's, but it will not be forgotten by those grateful hearts that these ministrations were without other reward than the gratitude they excited and the consciousness that he was doing the will of his Master.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3686"/>The Confederate soldier and the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, as he interpreted it, stood nearer than any other to his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/>No appeal to him in their behalf was ever made in vain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>To his fellowmen he was generous, sympathetic and ever ready to aid by his counsel and his co-operation and his means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>His brethren of his profession have attested by tongue and pen their recognition and appreciation of his valuable fellowship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/>The younger members of that profession bear willing witness to the abundant aid and cheerful support which at all times he afforded to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>He loved the <rs>South</rs>, her people and her interests, and gave thought and labor to their advancement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>He loved with a love that knew no bounds, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and her people, his brethren of her soil.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/>This claim has been made and published far and wide, and, as far as we know, no attempt has been made to controvert it.
