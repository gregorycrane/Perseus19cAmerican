<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Had he not started his wheel when he did, these lines would not have been written; for it was a moment later that the captain from the fore rigging bawled <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <q direct="unspecified">Hard a-port,</q> then, <q direct="unspecified">Hard astar-board.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>As the ship came about she fell into the trough of the sea, and for a short time, which seemed an age, she was practically on her beam ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The sergeant vanished as if by magic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/><q direct="unspecified">Man overboard</q> trembled on my lips, but I checked myself, realizing the futility of raising an alarm at that juncture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Wiping the brine from my eyes with my sleeve, I discovered something in the lee scuppers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Edging down carefully I seized it; whereupon a voice called out as well as it could through a Lit of the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic Ocean</placeName> that had taken refuge in his mouth, <q direct="unspecified">That's my hair.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/><q direct="unspecified"><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you, sergeant,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">are you hurt?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/><q direct="unspecified">No,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">but I am nearly drowned.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, now go below,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">and be a good boy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>He went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>An hour later we had a full grown gale bellowing after us, and I remained on deck to watch the splendid behavior of the ship and to listen to the full chorus which seemed to be performing for my special benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>A gale at sea always sends me to the key of G. Finally, chilled to the marrow, I had to yield to the blast and go below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>As I stepped down between decks, behold a whole menagerie in full voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Every conceivable sound proceeded from hundreds of sick and scared soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Hanging my dripping clothes where I hoped they would dry over night, I flung myself into the bunk already occupied by <num value="4">four</num> somewhat demoralized sergeants, thus adding <num value="1">one</num> more specimen to the <q direct="unspecified">floating show.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The motion of the ship soon lulled me into a <num value="16">sixteen</num>-knot sleep, from which <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> I was aroused by a motion not of the ship, and a hoarse whisper in my ear: <q direct="unspecified">Turn out, you are wanted in the cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The skylight is stove in and the cabin is flooded, and the water is up nearly to the grating in the boiler room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It is <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, and the devil to pay generally.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/></p> 
<p>The occasion didn't seem to demand an elaborate toilet, so in the pitchy night I quickly groped my way to the cabin, and as I stepped from the companion-way into the swirling suds that swished half way up the bulkhead, the scene struck me as indescribably funny.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Officers sat about the table looking as though they had lost their best friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Saluting, I said (unwisely, no doubt), <q direct="unspecified">Gentlemen, this looks very much like a fashionable watering-place.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Whereupon <num value="1">one</num> with somewhat of cant in his tone said, <q direct="unspecified">This is no time for frivolity or jesting.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/></p> 
<p>Looking at the chevron on my sleeve, I made no audible reply, but to the bucket bearers I said, sotto voce, <q direct="unspecified">They are in for how long?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, we will bail them out, anyway,</q> at which a broad smile broke out and went echoing down the cabin; and then we all <q direct="unspecified">turned to,</q> each <num value="1">one</num> steering his own bucket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>An hour or so later I saw my frivolous friend making for the stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/><q direct="unspecified">After you, sir,</q> rose to my lips, and halted there, while I preceded him up the winding stairs, letting my bucket, as the ship rolled, steer itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>As I reached the deck the orderly looked in my bucket and asked, <q direct="unspecified">Where is your water?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/><q direct="unspecified">In the chaplain's starboard boot&mdash;will explain later,</q> I replied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>At sea, accidents sometimes occur in pairs or <rs n="in sets" type="product">in sets</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>When I returned to the cabin I found a dapper little lieutenant issuing orders&mdash;forgetting that he was not commander-in-chief of the army and navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>I stood at attention, and was about to quote a passage from an ancient volume, for I knew something was going to happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Just then a sea struck the ship under the counter, lifted her endwise, and dropped her so suddenly that the would-be commander sat down, in his best clothes, in the not over-clean water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>I turned my head to wipe away tears&mdash;or was it the dirty water he had splashed in my face?&mdash;and then sympathetically remarked, <q direct="unspecified">You have dropped something, sir.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>He <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> disappeared so quickly that I failed to get more than a mental photograph of the young son of <persName n="Mars,,,,," id="n0304.0007.00030.00302" reg="mostcommon:Mars,nomatch:0"><surname>Mars</surname></persName>, and the water closed over a stern reality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>At <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, after <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> bailing, we were relieved and treated to a breakfast fit for the gods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>As I presented my tin cup and plate to the black knight at the galley, he poured half a pint of coffee into my cup and deposited <num value="1">one</num> boiled potato in the centre of my <measure n="10inch" type="distance">ten-inch</measure> plate&mdash;sans salt, sans pepper, sans everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>I declare, on the honor of a soldier, that I never before saw a boiled potato look so, utterly lonesome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>I think that I made a remark to that effect at the time, for the darkey seemed amused, and when I told him to keep his black hand out of my new tin plate he opened his mouth to such an extent that his ears were in eclipse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>My breakfast disposed of, I went on deck and deposited myself in a huge coil of <measure n="6inch" type="distance">six-inch</measure> hawser on the after part of the quarter-deck, where for hours&mdash;and alone&mdash;I watched the mighty combers which, as yet, had not tumbled aboard to any great damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Suddenly the door of the after house flew open, and out shot my captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Righting himself, he said, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, you must not sit there, it is dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The field gun lashed to the rail near where you are sitting was washed overboard last night.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>I thanked him for his kind warning, adding that I was not a loaded field piece, and I didn't purpose to go off after that fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Meanwhile, I was watching a tremendous comber making toward the starboard quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Pointing in that direction, I said, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, that fellow means mischief, and you had better seek shelter.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>He took the hint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>As the lawless comber with a thundering roar broke over the deck, I instinctively seized the topmost flakes of the coil with both hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>After the tons of the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">North Atlantic</placeName> had left the deck and gone back to its own, I found myself jammed into that coil doubled up like a jack-knife with feet and hands sticking through different parts of the mass of nearly wrecked cordage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>I knew something had happened, but which was <persName n="Hawes,,,,," id="n0304.0007.00030.00303" reg="nearbymention:Hawes,Levi,Lindley,,"><surname>Hawes</surname></persName> and which was hawser I was too badly twisted and tangled to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/><q direct="unspecified">What would my mother think of me now?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>I soliloquized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>By dint of vigorous kicking, <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> wriggling, clawing, and sundry other manoeuvres I shuffled that hempen coil, and finding that I was not <persName n="Hawes,,,,," id="n0304.0007.00031.00304" reg="nearbymention:Hawes,Levi,Lindley,,"><surname>Hawes</surname></persName> de combat, nor my zeal dampened (but with some loss of dignity as a soldier), I went in search of less tight-fitting and clinging garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Of the <num value="1500">1,500</num> soldiers aboard, not a soul of them knew anything of the circus I had had.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The next morning came in with a cloudless sky, the ship on an even keel, on a glassy sea. As I went forward I looked over the rail and noticed that the water had a peculiar color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>To <persName n="Simmons,Sergeant,,,," id="n0304.0007.00031.00305" reg="mostcommon:Simmons,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Simmons</surname></persName>, who was to be my guest at the galley, I said: <q direct="unspecified">We are in shoal water,</q> and looking ahead, added, <q direct="unspecified">and we are shoaling fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We shall be aground in less than <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>. However, let us make sure of our potatoes.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>As we went below I heard the gong sound in the engine room, and at that instant the ship came to a full stop, but without a perceptible jar, on Frying-Pan Shoals&mdash;and within the <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> specified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Adequately to describe our experience during the <measure n="11hours" type="date">eleven hours</measure> we were stranded on the worst coast of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would take more time than this occasion affords or your patience would allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>I have been on the rocks off an inhospitable coast of <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, and on a lee shore elsewhere, but perhaps this was the most trying situation of all, because in this case infinitely more was involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Although the situation seemed desperate I never lost courage for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>From my diary I have written out somewhat in detail an account of our experience on Frying-Pan Shoals; but to-night I can give you only a glimpse of what stared us in the face on that <dateStruct value="1862-02-28"><day reg="28">twenty-eighth</day> day of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Of course I had but a superficial knowledge of our surroundings, but the school had been opened and I was in the mood to put myself in training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>To my amazement I found that the port anchor had been let go, notwithstanding the fact that that end of the ship was already stuck fast in the mud. As <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0304.0007.00031.00306" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> came on deck he asked the captain, <q direct="unspecified">What's that?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>pointing to the flag, Union down, in the port fore rigging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/><q direct="unspecified">Flag of distress,</q> said the skipper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/><q direct="unspecified">Can you display it nowhere else?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>asked the general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/><q direct="unspecified">Yes, at the mizzen peak,</q> replied <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> the skipper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/><q direct="unspecified">Half-mast it at the mizzen peak, Union up, forever!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>roared the general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Then a signal gun was fired, but this was immediately muzzled, for <placeName key="tgn,2335384" n="1.000 16" reg="fort macon, carteret, north carolina">Fort Macon</placeName> and horsemen were in plain sight from our deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>All the troops were immediately ordered to go below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>I recognized the wisdom of the order, but I concluded that it didn't include me. So I ranged alongside the ship's quartermaster, who at once adopted me as his assistant; and it proved to be the longest watch on deck that I ever experienced,&mdash;from <time value="8am">8 o'clock A. M.</time>, till about <time value="8pm">8 o'clock P. M.</time></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It was soon discovered that the good ship had resented the indignity of dropping the anchor under her forefoot by rolling over onto it and forcing a fluke through her iron bow. At this hour we had only <measure n="14feet" type="distance">fourteen feet</measure> of water forward, while the ship drew about <measure n="18feet" type="distance">eighteen feet</measure>, and the tide was falling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>But as the water fell outside it continued to rise in the forward compartment, till the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA31">Thirty-first Massachusetts</orgName> boys had the choice of being drowned in an iron kettle or vacating their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>No deaths by drowning were reported.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Doubtless <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0304.0007.00032.00307" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> comprehended the gravity of the situation, but he was outwardly cool and collected during the entire day, and actively in command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>To arouse the ship from her siesta various expedients were resorted to. Orders were issued to jettison some of the heavier cargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> things I noticed going overboard were mosquito netting and camp and garrison equipage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>In this connection the <rs type="role" reg="acting-Quartermaster">acting quartermaster</rs> of the expedition cut a sorry figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Seated on the <q direct="unspecified">booby hatch,</q> with his mouth full of oaths, flourishing a revolver and threatening to shoot, this officer was supposed to be executing orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>While I had no connection with his squad I was a witness of what was being done on that part of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Finally a barrel got jammed in the hatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The air was blue with oaths, and I noticed some of the men edging away from the flourishing pistol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>I could stand the pressure no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Seizing a capstan bar I stepped to the hatch and said, <q direct="unspecified">Lower a bit,</q> then, canting the barrel, said, <q direct="unspecified">Hoist,</q> and the situation was relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>To the disgust of the <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> officer some <num value="1">one</num> cried, <q direct="unspecified">Bully for the sergeant.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Spluttering oaths the officer turned on me, and, pointing his pistol threateningly, demanded if I belonged to that squad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>I looked him square in the face for a moment, and then said, perhaps with more emphasis than my rank would fairly warrant, <q direct="unspecified">No, sir,</q> then pointing to his pistol, added, <q direct="unspecified">but that is no good.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>To his credit be it said the pistol-bearer quieted down, and the pistol was not in evidence during the rest of the day. As I turned away my colonel laid his hand on my shoulder, saying, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, I'm glad to see you here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>That's a miserable fellow.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>I know I was terribly angry at the wretch; but the kind words of my colonel relieved the tension.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>After some hours a steamer was made out coming up the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Her progress was closely watched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The stars and stripes floated from her peak, but she might be a rebel gun-boat for all that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>As she rounded to at a distance and headed for us a boat was called away with an officer in charge to ascertain the nationality of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>She proved to be the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <term type="ship">gunboat</term> <rs type="ship">Mount Vernon</rs>, on blockade duty off <placeName reg="Cape Fear, North Carolina, United States" key="tgn,1122498">Cape Fear river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>She had fortunately seen the flash of our gun, but was too far off to hear the report, and immediately started to investigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Imagination alone can picture forth our feelings of relief at having a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> gun-boat between us and the rebel fort at the mouth of <placeName reg="Cape Fear, North Carolina, United States" key="tgn,1122498">Cape Fear river</placeName>&mdash;not to mention the rising wind and muttering sea, which would soon reduce the good <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Mississippi</rs> to a scrap heap unless relieved at flood tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/><persName n="Glisson,Captain,,,," id="n0304.0007.00033.00308" reg="mostcommon:Glisson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Glisson</surname></persName> of the <rs type="place">Mt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>To save his own ship he was obliged to haul off to deeper water, for he had touched bottom several times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Meanwhile our engine was working full steam ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The quartermaster and I were forward charged with heaving the lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>As a precaution troops were being transferred to the <rs type="place">Mt. Vernon</rs>, for there was slight expectation of saving our ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Just here the quartermaster said, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, I've got to go aft; look out for falling spars as the ship rolls.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>When he returned, he said the <rs>Maine</rs> troops <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> were being sent to the gun-boat, but he had obtained my colonel's consent, and would I remain and take the <num value="1">one</num> chance,&mdash; <q direct="unspecified">We need you&mdash;for, if we don't get off this tide, good-by <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>I simply said <q direct="unspecified">I'll stick.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>A little later he said, <q direct="unspecified">I wish you would take the lead again, you have a more sensitive touch.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>My heart gave a big thump as I felt the lead trail aft just a bit. As with tense nerves I watched the lead-line, the <rs>General</rs>, apparently thinking I had fallen asleep, or was idling, yelled, <q direct="unspecified">Keep that lead a-going.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Turning to the quartermaster, I said, with as steady voice as I could command, <q direct="unspecified">She forges ahead, sir.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/><q direct="unspecified">Are you sure?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>he asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/><q direct="unspecified">Sure,</q> I replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Then he repeated my report to the quarter-deck, which report brought cheers from every mouth and tears from many eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>The boats were recalled, and, on account of the heavy sea, were with great difficulty hoisted aboard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>A few hours later, piloted by the <rs type="place">Mt. Vernon</rs>, we let go our anchor near the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,1122498" n="1.000 232" reg="cape fear, north carolina, united states">Cape Fear river</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The next morning we took a sailing-master from the <rs type="place">Mt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>and the ship badly <q direct="unspecified">by the head.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The next day we hauled around to <placeName reg="Seabrook Landing, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2650081">Seabrook Landing</placeName>, about <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Hilton Head</placeName></placeName>, and disembarked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> night we were quartered in a cotton shed, pole floor, and it is my belief that we suffered more from cold than we ever did in <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, and the poles were the knottiest and crokedest that ever grew upright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Our flesh was torn as well as our clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>A wag had <q direct="unspecified">For rent</q> pinned to the tail of his coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>I didn't need a placard, but rather needle and thread and court-plaster.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>Our battalion was moved out about half a mile from the landing on the road to <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Hilton Head</placeName>, to serve as <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>We pitched our tents in a cotton field; and here I had my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experience as a Southern field-hand, from which duty I was detailed to serve as sergeant of the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Soon the rumor spread through the camp that the rebels were in force between our position and the <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName>, and I detected a nervousness on the part of some of the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Early in the afternoon the officer <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> of the day said he was sick, and, as all the other officers were on duty at the landing, he would turn over the command of the guard to me. (A year later he acknowledged that he was scared, not sick.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>As the officer of the day disappeared a staff officer dashed into our camp and inquired for <persName n="Hawes,Sergeant,,,," id="n0304.0007.00035.00309" reg="nearbymention:Hawes,Levi,Lindley,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Hawes</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>It would seem that my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sighting the breakers before spoken of, and also my observing and remarking on the shoaling of the water on Frying-Pan Shoals, had been reported to the general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Hence my summons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>There was no cross-examination in my case; and when the president said, <q direct="unspecified">Thank you, sergeant, that's all,</q> I felt relieved; for I could never tell a story twice alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>As I left the court I met the ship's quartermaster, who asked me, <q direct="unspecified">How near to the breakers were we on the night of the gale?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>I have just testified that we were within <num value="1">one</num> ship's length.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/><q direct="unspecified">In my judgment,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">we were within <num value="2">two</num> ship's length, and I so stated to the court.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/></p> 
<p>Soon after returning to my post I saw the head of a column of troops debouching from the woods about a mile to the front of our position.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>When the <num value="3">three</num> companies were transferred to <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName>, I was detailed as acting adjutant of the post.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>Here altogether new responsibilities were thrust upon us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The many bayous leading to the rear of <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName> were always a source of anxiety, for this whole section seemed to be cursed by or with guerrillas; and it was our fortune to capture and disperse several gangs of these wretches.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Within a few weeks after our arrival, the <rs>Hartford</rs> and <rs>Brooklyn</rs> dropped anchor off the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>It was <persName n="Farragut,Admiral,,,," id="n0304.0011.00051.00472" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Farragut</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and only visit after the capture, and as he remained over night, the garrisons proceeded to burn powder and send up rockets in his honor, and in various other ways demonstrated to the illustrious hero that his name and record were as dear to us as they were to the blue-jackets, and I may add that his visit was a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-send to us. At <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> the next morning the <rs>Hartford</rs> and <rs>Brooklyn</rs> went to sea. The echo of our guns fired in salute had hardly died away, when the signal gun brought every soldier to the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Then a solid shot went whistling across the river, and then another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Every gun in both forts was trained for business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>At this juncture <q direct="unspecified"><term type="ship">H. B. M. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>He was courteously informed <q direct="unspecified">by what authority,</q> although he was already informed as regards <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0304.0011.00051.00473" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s orders in general and particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>The <rs>Hartford</rs>, flying the admiral's flag, was amenable to this particular order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Luckily for this irate Englishman, he had level-headed <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> men to deal with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Had we observed strictly the letter of our orders, the <rs>Rinaldo</rs> would have been knocked into kindling wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The commander was kindly earned in regard to his future behavior while passing this outpost and I am sure that the boarding officer indulged in no ambiguous language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>At this time the notable <rs n="General Order 28" type="misc">General Order No. 28</rs> had been in force about <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, and had become of almost international importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>Rebels and their sympathizers, foreign as well as American, were using their utmost endeavors to bury its author under a world of obloquy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>The world now knows that <rs n="General Order" type="misc">General Order</rs> No, <num value="8">8</num> was productive of good, and only of good, to <hi rend="italics">all</hi> <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> <hi rend="italics">the people</hi> within the limits of the <orgName n="Department of the Gulf" type="department">Department of the Gulf</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>No soldier ever misconstrued the significance of the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>I can't believe that any rebel ever did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>It is my belief that <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0304.0011.00052.00475" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> spoke advisedly when he said <q direct="unspecified">there were more paroled rebel soldiers in New Orleans than there were Union troops within <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> of his headquarters,</q> because he had caused a census to be taken, and was thus enabled to <hi rend="italics">locate</hi> every man and woman in the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="ME13">Thirteenth Maine</orgName> was put to a cruel test by being placed, in our already weak physical condition, in the malarial swamps of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Louisiana</placeName>, in mid-summer, and kept there for more than a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>But we never forgot that we belonged to the <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Lord</rs>'s Country</q>&mdash;never forgot who we were, and what.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>And when a soldier tumbled off the draw-bridge into the moat among the alligators, it furnished amusement for the entire garrison&mdash;his little dog barking in unison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>A few days later the pet dog was <q direct="unspecified">gathered in</q> by an alligator.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>I apprehend that no troops scanned the orders of their department commander more critically or with more complete satisfaction than did we during all these months when the saintly sinners in New Orleans were devoutly praying for the advent of yellow fever, while we, from the head of the roster to the foot, were <hi rend="italics">prayerfully working</hi> to render its approach impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>In New Orleans <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0304.0011.00052.00477" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> organized a brigade of <q direct="unspecified">contrabands,</q> prisoners, and the odds and ends of every nationality, armed with picks, shovels, hoes, brooms, and mule carts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>which, under competent officers, proceeded to remove inches, and in some localities <hi rend="italics">feet</hi>, of the accumulation of a century of fever-breeding material from almost the entire surface within the limits of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>I do not know that the natives had a vision of a new heaven, but I am sure that there dawned on their Astonished <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> sight a <hi rend="italics">new earth</hi>, of which, perhaps, they never had even dreamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The streets and alleys of the city had been the theatre of many an upheaval; but I question if New Orleans, as a whole, ever before, or since, got into <hi rend="italics">such a scrape</hi>, or had so happy an issue out of a deplorable condition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Of course the gallant action of our fleet in forcing its way past these forts, and dealing with the rebel crafts above, was a theme on which it was our delight to dwell, and from which we gathered inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The <term type="ship">gunboat</term> <rs type="ship">Varuna</rs> sunk or disabled <num value="6">six</num> of her antagonists before she received her mortal wound; but the gallant <persName n="Boggs,Captain,,,," id="n0304.0011.00053.00478" reg="mostcommon:Boggs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Boggs</surname></persName> ran his sinking ship to the bank and tied her to a tree, and saved every soul aboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>The trucks of the bow gun-carriage were under water when the gun fired its last shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>When I climbed to her half-submerged deck a few months afterwards, I instinctively took off my cap in salute of the flag that <hi rend="italics">once proudly floated</hi> at her peak, but was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> hauled down in <hi rend="italics">token of surrender</hi>. But the tangible reminder of all the gallant deeds performed in connection with the capture of the forts rendered our inaction more and more irksome.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Then came the rumor&mdash;through rebel sources (sources, by the way, through which we received much information of the doings in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>)&mdash;that <persName n="Banks,General,,,," id="n0304.0011.00053.00479" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> had been ordered to relieve <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0304.0011.00053.00480" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>We hoped to be included in the annexation business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>But the programme was materially modified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>About <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> later I received a letter from <persName n="Dudley,General,,,," id="n0304.0011.00053.00482" reg="mostcommon:Dudley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dudley</surname></persName>'s adjutant-general asking me to come to <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName> immediately, for he and other officers had recommended me to <persName n="Paine,Colonel,,,," id="n0304.0011.00053.00483" reg="mostcommon:Paine,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Paine</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1LARegiment">First Louisiana Regiment</orgName>, who desired an adjutant familiar with the duties of the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>By reason of lack of transportation, a week or <num value="2">two</num> passed before I was able to report; and then I found the army all ready to move out towards <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>The colonel had been obliged to detail <num value="1">one</num> of his own officers, and it was too late to make any change.

Previous to this date, several officers and enlisted men, disgusted at being cooped up in garrison, had sought and obtained promotion and transfer to other regiments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Let me say here, parenthetically, that at least <num value="2">two</num> brigade commanders&mdash;regular army officers&mdash;made application to have the <orgName type="regiment" key="13MERegiment">Thirteenth Maine Regiment</orgName> assigned each to his brigade for the <rs type="place">Port Hudson</rs> campaign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>In <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> the regiment rallied around the flag in New Orleans, where we performed <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost guard</orgName> duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>This change of station and re-assembling of the regiment afforded some relief, but it was not the sort of relief we most desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>And we soon found that, under the existing administration, <rs n="General Order 28" type="misc">General Order No. 28</rs>, before spoken of, had become less operative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Officers, and even enlisted men, were subjected to gross insults by the women of the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>Late <num value="1">one</num> afternoon the orderly at our headquarters hutriedly entered the office, saying, <q direct="unspecified">Adjutant, <persName n="Banks,General,,,," id="n0304.0011.00054.00484" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> is on the sidewalk, and he desires to see you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>As I presented myself, the general put his arm through mine and invited me to take a walk with him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Suddenly the general halted, dropped my arm, and then said: <q direct="unspecified">Adjutant, will you please take the number of this mansion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>As I was riding with some of my officers this afternoon, I was grossly insulted by some women on the balcony of this house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>You will place a guard here and allow any <num value="1">one</num> to go in, but no <num value="1">one</num> is to be allowed to come out.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>Again taking my arm, the general accompanied me to our headquarters on <address><street n="St. Charles street">St. Charles street</street></address>, talking on subjects entirely disconnected front army affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>A suitable guard was immediately placed as ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>In due time a court-martial was convened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>A woman <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> was tried and found guilty of the charge preferred and specification, and sentenced to spend her vacation months on <placeName reg="Ship Island, Harrison, Mississippi" key="tgn,1009139">Ship Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>The spirit of <rs n="General Order 28" type="misc">General Order No. 28</rs> became operative from that hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>The virtues of <q direct="unspecified">the lightning-rod,</q> as the boys called <rs n="Order 28">Order No. 28</rs>, were again to be tested.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>The fact that our colonel was then on detached service led me to believe that the <orgName type="regiment" key="ME13">Thirteenth Maine</orgName> was destined to remain on duty in New Orleans for an indefinite period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>The post commander (<persName n="Buck,,,,," id="n0304.0011.00055.00486" reg="mostcommon:Buck,nomatch:0"><surname>Buck</surname></persName>) and all the officers of the <num value="4">four</num> companies stationed here were promoted out of the <orgName type="regiment" key="13MERegiment">Thirteenth Maine Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>Furthermore, the regiment contained many good mechanics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Courts-martial were unknown in my company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>During more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> service, I had occasion to discipline but <num value="1">one</num> man&mdash;this for lying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>While I was proud of my command, it was a grievous disappointment to be assigned to garrison duty, of which I had had more than enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Patrolling the lakes and bayous, day and night, in an open boat, was not ideal yachting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>And when I learned that the <orgName type="regiment" key="ME13">Thirteenth Maine</orgName> was booked for the <rs n="Red River Campaign" type="campaign">Red River campaign</rs>, I concluded that the government didn't need my services, anyway,&mdash;surely not at the <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>After nearly a year of this sort of service (and by a process of <hi rend="italics">evolution</hi> having become known as the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 91">Ninety-first Regiment</orgName>, U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>It took a colonel, <rs type="role" n="Major">major</rs>, captain, and lieutenant about <num value="1">one</num> hour to find out how much the <num value="11">eleven</num> officers really chose to know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>The major&mdash;a regular army officer&mdash;said he would like to have me transferred to the regular service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>I was profoundly grateful for their proposed recommendations, and I frankly told them so.
