<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We sailed from New York on board the <term type="ship">brig</term> <rs type="ship">Betsy Ames</rs>, on <dateStruct value="-10-5"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg="5">5th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In all we were <num value="6">six</num> passengers, beside <persName n="Bartlett,Mrs.,,,," id="n0088.0009.00006.00032" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>, the wife of the captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We were bound for <placeName key="tgn,1016316" n="1.000 7" reg="cardenas,matanzas,cuba,north and central america">Cardenas</placeName>, and all went well until the morning of the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="17">17th ult.</day></dateStruct>, when we observed a schooner making right for us. There was nothing suspicious about her at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight, but about <time value="9am">9 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><persName n="Bartlett,Captain,,,," id="n0088.0009.00006.00033" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName> then ordered all sail to be made, but the breeze shortly after died away, and the now suspicious schooner made upon us, and fired another shot, which also fell a little short of our vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> shot was fired, but we could not see in what direction it went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They fired a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> shot, which passed close alongside our <rs type="role">brig.</rs> This latter result caused our captain to take in sail and jog along more leisurely, till the schooner made up to us about <time value="12mid">twelve o'clock, M.</time> Still, we could not tell what the little craft was, as she had no color flying.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When she came up to us the captain of the schooner ordered our captain to take <num value="1">one</num> of his boats and come on board with his papers, to which he responded, <quote>My boats are unfit for service.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The captain of the schooner then said, <quote>I will come on board your brig, then,</quote> which he immediately did. He came in his own boat with an officer and <num value="4">four</num> men, when the captain and his officer went down into the cabin with our captain, and took possession of all his papers, then told him that he was a prisoner of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>While the officers were in the cabin, the men who were left in the boat sprang on deck and into the forehold, from which they took <measure n="2barrels" type="mass">two barrels</measure> of potatoes, about <num value="24">two dozen</num> cabbages, and a coil of rope, and put them into their boat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>When the officers came up on deck again, they ordered our crew to the boat, and thence to the privateer, which proved to be the <rs>Flying Sally</rs>, of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, on board of which there were about <num value="60">sixty</num> men and <num value="2">two</num> pivot-guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In a short time a prize crew was sent on board, and as our captain had his wife, they did not transfer him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The prize crew were <num value="7">seven</num> in all. The master was an old cooper, named <persName n="Tully,,Joseph,,," id="n0088.0009.00006.00034" reg="default:Tully,Joseph,,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Tully</surname></persName>, who used to cooper both at Mantanzas and <placeName key="tgn,1016316" n="1.000 7" reg="cardenas,matanzas,cuba,north and central america">Cardenas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He evidently knew nothing of seamanship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>About <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> we parted with the pirate schooner, and nothing particular occurred until the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num>, at daybreak, when we made land, but did not know where we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Some of the crew said we were north of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>; but, as it turned out, we were south of <placeName key="tgn,2545132" n="1.000 102" reg="north edisto river, charleston, south carolina">North Edisto</placeName>, where we ran aground and lost our false keel, but got off again, and went to sea. On the following day we saw no land, and on the evening of the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num> we made the land of St. Helena, almost the exact place where we were on the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="2">25th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>After tacking off and on all night, we were still in the same place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Then we beat up to the <rs type="place">North Edisto Inlet</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>While beating up we espied a schooner, which fact caused the crowd to take alarm, and, to a man, they rushed below, armed themselves with their swords, knives and pistols, bagged their clothing and a few little valuables, then prepared for the boats, as they intended to beach the <rs type="role">brig.</rs> They were apprehensive that the vessel sighted was a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> gunboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>When they came on deck, however, and took another observation, they discovered that it was only a little schooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Then we made the inlet, when a boat's crew, armed to the teeth, came on board, and piloted us up to the anchorage, about <measure n="40miles" type="distance">40 miles</measure> inland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>There they discharged their prizes, and the vessels were towed up to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> by tow-boats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We arrived at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> at about <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P. M.</time> on the <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="2">27th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Next morning the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">General Clinch</rs> took us on board with our baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I may also state that the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Planter</rs> towed us up to this safe <quote>pirates' village ground.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>When we got into <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> the prize captain took us to a private boarding-house, his agent having closed his office previous to our arrival.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Next morning we strolled about the city, and called upon the <rs>British Consul</rs>, who told us, strange as it may seem, that he could render us no assistance, as we had done wrong in taking our passage on board an Americal vessel, knowing that the <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num> countries</hi> were at war, therefore, if the owners of the prize had the good feeling to pay our expenses it was only to be expected from their generous character, but they could not be forced to do so. About <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> we were called upon to go to the marshal's office, and when we got there the marshal told us that we were <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We were then sent to the city jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The <rs>Captain</rs>'s wife and the other lady of our company did not accompany us to the jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We remained in this limbo till <time value="8:30oclock">half-past 8 o'clock</time> P. M. having been released at that time through the exertions of Her British Majesty's Consul, <persName n="Bunce,Mister,,,," id="n0088.0009.00007.00035" reg="mostcommon:Bunce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bunce</surname></persName>, who had been induced to act then only because an old <name>English</name> captain who saw us in prison went to him and prevailed upon him to use his influence in our behalf.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The next day we looked round to see if we could devise any means of getting away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The Spanish Consul informed us that the only schooner which was going for some time had been loaded and had sailed already for <placeName key="tgn,1016389" n="1.000 3" reg="matanzas,matanzas,cuba,north and central america">Matanzas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>However, we had the good fortune to meet <persName n="Salas,Mister,,,," id="n0088.0009.00007.00036" reg="mostcommon:Salas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Salas</surname></persName>, the owner of <num value="2">two</num> vessels which were ready for sea, and it appeared that <persName n="Bunce,Mister,,,," id="n0088.0009.00007.00037" reg="mostcommon:Bunce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bunce</surname></persName> had been to him to endeavor to procure us a passage; and as he could not assist us, <persName n="Salas,Mister,,,," id="n0088.0009.00007.00038" reg="mostcommon:Salas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Salas</surname></persName> offered to take us to <placeName key="tgn,1016389" n="1.000 3" reg="matanzas,matanzas,cuba,north and central america">Matanzas</placeName> on credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>That arrangement included the other <name>British</name> passengers, my wife, and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The other <num value="3">three</num> passengers were Germans, having American passports, and could not be taken on board the <term type="ship">schooner</term> <rs type="ship">Jasper</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The crew on board this craft declared her unseaworthy, after getting their advanced pay, and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><persName n="Salas,Mister,,,," id="n0088.0009.00007.00039" reg="mostcommon:Salas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Salas</surname></persName> had therefore to ship another crew, and we got ready for sea. As the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">Rowena</rs> was getting her name changed to the <rs>St. Helena</rs> of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston, S. C.</placeName>, having been loaded with a cargo of naval stores, awaiting a favorable opportunity to run the blockade, we waited and went out with her. So, on the night of the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">2d inst.</day></dateStruct>, she was taken in tow by a steamer, and we followed her as closely as we could out past the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> vessels, and in half an hour were after her, and could see the lights of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ships quite distinctly, although none of them seemed to make any movement, and did not observe us. It was about <time value="10pm">ten o'clock P. M.</time> when we got clear of their lights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Then we thought ourselves safe on the sea once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We arrived here safely on the night of <date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="9">9th inst.</day></dateStruct></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>And now when I think of the scenes I have passed through since I left New York, (the scenes of a honey-moon excursion,) what impressed me most was the almost death-like solemn appearance of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and the entire absence of any thing like business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It appeared as if a Scotch fast-day was being observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>At least <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the stores have <quote>To let</quote> posted upon the shut doors, and those which are occupied are all closed at <time value="12pm">noon</time> every day, and every man has to turn out to drill, or be fined by the police the next day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Another thing which struck me was the almost entire absence of <quote>hard cash.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><num value="1">One</num> of my companions and I went into a bar-room to have a drink, and the only money we had to offer was <persName><foreName>Spanish</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>My friend offered a <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>dollar piece, but the barkeeper was bewildered; he did not know its value, and asked us what it was worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Being informed that it was worth <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> <measure n="12.5cents" type="currency">twelve and a half cents</measure> in <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, he offered <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> in paper change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Then a crowd gathered around us, staring their eyes out of their heads, almost, at the novelty of the sight of gold, and many of them seemed really anxious to be the possessors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>We saw no small change except pieces of paper which certify that they are <quote>good for <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure>,</quote> <quote>good for <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure>,</quote> and so on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>I must say that men, women, and children in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> seem united in the cause of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>When they found that <num value="1">one</num> of my fellow-passengers and myself were <persName n="Scotchmen,,,,," id="n0088.0009.00007.00040" reg="mostcommon:Scotchmen,nomatch:0"><surname>Scotchmen</surname></persName>, they treated us very respectfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Though our Consul did not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seem to sympathize with us, still he exerted himself well on our behalf when he found that we were in prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>All seemed to have great respect for him in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>. </p></body></text></p></quote> <milestone unit="hr"/> </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>A few days before our regiment received orders to join <persName n="Lyon,General,,,," id="n0088.0015.00009.00051" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName>, on his march to <placeName reg="Wilson's Creek, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,2776150">Wilson's Creek</placeName>, the drummer of our company was taken sick and conveyed to the hospital, and on the evening preceding the day that we were to march, a negro was arrested within the lines of the camp, and brought before our <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, who asked him <quote>what business he had within the lines?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He replied: <quote>I know a drummer that you would like to enlist in your company, and I have come to tell you of it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He was immediately requested to inform the drummer that if he would enlist for our short term of service, he would be allowed extra pay, and to do this, he must be on the ground early in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The negro was then passed beyond the guard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>On the following morning there appeared before the <rs>Captain</rs>'s quarters during the beating of the <hi rend="italics">reveille</hi>, a good-looking, middle-aged woman, dressed in deep mourning, leading by the hand a sharp, sprightly-looking boy, apparently about <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age. Her story was soon told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>She was from East-<placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, where her husband had been killed by the rebels, and all their property destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>She had come to <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> in search of her sister, but not finding her, and being destitute of money, she thought if she could procure a situation for her boy as a drummer for the short time that we had to remain in the service, she could find employment for herself, and perhaps find her sister by the time we were discharged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>During the rehearsal of her story the little fellow kept his eyes intently fixed upon the countenance of the <rs>Captain</rs>, who was about to express a determination not to take so small a boy, when he spoke out: <quote>Don't be afraid, captain, I can drum.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>This was spoken with so much confidence, that the <rs>Captain</rs> immediately observed, with a smile: <quote>Well, well, <rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, bring the drum, and order our fifer to come forward.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>In a few moments the drum was produced, and our fifer, a tall, round-shouldered, good-natured fellow, from the <rs>Dubuque</rs> mines, who stood, when erect, something over <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> in height, soon made his appearance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Upon being introduced to his new comrade, he stooped down, with his hands resting upon his knees, that were thrown forward into an acute angle, and after peering into the little fellow's face a moment, he observed: <quote>My little man, can you drum?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/><quote>Yes, sir,</quote> he replied, <quote>I drummed for <persName n="Hill,Captain,,,," id="n0088.0015.00009.00052" reg="mostcommon:Hill,D.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">captain</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Our fifer immediately commenced straightening himself upward until all the angles in his person had disappeared, when he placed his fife in his mouth, and played the <quote>Flowers of Edenborough,</quote> <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult things to follow with the drum that could have been selected, and nobly did the little fellow follow him, showing himself to be a master of the drum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>When the music ceased, our <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> turned to the mother and observed: <quote><rs type="role2">Madam</rs>, I will take your boy. What is his name?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>As she arose, she observed: <quote><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, you will bring him back with you, won't you?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/><quote>Yes, Yes,</quote> he replied, <quote>we will be certain to bring him back with us. We shall be discharged in <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>In an hour after, our company led the <rs>Iowa</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> out of camp, our drum and fife playing <quote>The girl I left behind me.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>During the fight at <placeName reg="Wilson's Creek, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,2776150">Wilson's Creek</placeName> I was stationed with a part of our company on the right of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Totten,,,,," id="n0088.0015.00009.00054" reg="mostcommon:Totten,nomatch:0"><surname>Totten</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, while the balance of our company, with a part of the <rs>Illinois</rs> regiment, was ordered down into a deep ravine upon our left, in which it was known a portion of the enemy was concealed, with whom they were soon engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>and soon after, hostilities having ceased upon both sides, the order came for our main force to fall back upon <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, while a part of the <rs>Iowa</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> and <num value="2">two</num> companies of the <rs>Missouri</rs> regiment were to camp upon the ground and cover the retreat next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>That night I was detailed for guard duty, my turn of guard closing with the morning call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>When I went out with the officer as a relief, I found that my post was upon a high eminence that overlooked the deep ravine in which our men had engaged the enemy, until <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Totten,,,,," id="n0088.0015.00009.00058" reg="mostcommon:Totten,nomatch:0"><surname>Totten</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName> came to their assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>It was a dreary, lonesome beat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The moon had gone down in the early part of the night, while the stars twinkled dimly through a hazy atmosphere, lighting up imperfectly the surrounding objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Occasionally I would place my ear near the ground and listen for the sound of footsteps, but all was silent save the far-off howling of the wolf, that seemed to scent upon the evening air the banquet that we had been preparing for him. The hours passed slowly away, when at length the morning light began to streak along the eastern sky, making surrounding objects more plainly visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Presently I heard a drum beat up the morning call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I thought it came from the camp of the enemy across the creek; but as I listened, I found that it came up from the deep ravine; for a few minutes it was silent, and then as it became more light I heard it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>I listened &mdash; the sound of the drum was familiar to me &mdash; and I knew that it was <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>I was about to desert my post to go to his assistance, when I discovered the officer of the guard approaching with <num value="2">two</num> men. We all listened to the sound, and were satisfied that it was <persName><foreName>Eddie</foreName></persName>'s drum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I asked permission to go to his assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The officer hesitated, saying that the orders were to march in <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>. I promised to be back in that time, and he consented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>I immediately started down the hill through the thick undergrowth, and upon reaching the valley I followed the sound of the drum, and soon found him seated upon the ground, his back leaning against the trunk of a fallen tree, while his drum hung upon a bush in front of him, reaching nearly to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>As soon as he discovered me he dropped his drumsticks <pb id="p.10" n="10"/>and exclaimed, <quote>O Corporal!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I am so glad to see you. Give me a drink,</quote> reaching out his hand for my canteen, which was empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I immediately turned to bring him some water from the brook that I could hear rippling through the bushes near by, when thinking that I was about to leave him, he commenced crying, saying: <quote>Don't leave me, Corporal &mdash; I can't walk.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>I was soon back with the water, when I discovered that both of his feet had been shot away by a cannon-ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>After satisfying his thirst, he looked up into my face and said: <quote>You don't think I will die, Corporal, do you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>This man said I would not &mdash; he said the surgeon could cure my feet.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>I now discovered a man lying in the grass near him. By his dress I recognized him as belonging to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It appeared that he had been shot through the bowels, and had fallen near where <persName><foreName>Eddie</foreName></persName> lay. Knowing that he could not live, and seeing the condition of the boy, he had crawled to him, taken off his buckskin suspenders, and corded the little fellow's legs below the knee, and then lay down and died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>While he was telling me these particulars, I heard the tramp of cavalry coming down the ravine, and in a moment a scout of the enemy was upon us, and I was taken prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>I requested the officer to take <persName n="Eddy,,,,," id="n0088.0015.00010.00059" reg="mostcommon:Eddy,nomatch:0"><surname>Eddy</surname></persName> up in front of him, and he did so, carrying him with great tenderness and care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>When we reached the camp of the enemy the little fellow was dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It is now about <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> since I made my escape from <persName n="McCulloch,,,,," id="n0088.0015.00010.00060" reg="mostcommon:McCulloch,Ben,,,:1"><surname>McCulloch</surname></persName>'s grasp.

He received a musket-shot wound in the right thigh, the ball passing through the intervening flesh, and lodging in the left thigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>The boy repaired to the rear and applied to the doctor to dress his wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>He, however, manifested a peculiar reserve in the matter, requesting the doctor to keep his misfortune a secret from his comrades and officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>He then asked the surgeon if he would dress his wound at once, in order that he might be enabled to return to the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>The surgeon told him that he was not in a condition to admit of his return, and that he had better go to the hospital; but the young brave insisted upon going back, offering as an argument in favor of it the fact that he had fired <num value="22">twenty-two</num> rounds after receiving his wound, and he was confident he could fire as many more after his wound should be dressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>The surgeon found he could not prevent his returning to the field, so he attended to his wants, and the young soldier went off to rejoin his comrades in their struggle, and remained, dealing out his ammunition to good account until the day was over, as if nothing had happened to him. Several days after he returned to the doctor to have his wound redressed, and continued to pay him daily visits in his leisure hours, attending to duty in the mean time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>A case in some particulars not dissimilar to the above is related of a boy about <measure n="11years" type="date">eleven years</measure> old, whose father, a volunteer, had been taken prisoner by the rebels some time before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>The boy smuggled himself on board <num value="1">one</num> of the transports at <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, laden with troops for this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>On the field, the morning of the great fight, he joined the <orgName type="regiment" key="OH78">Seventy-eighth Ohio</orgName>, and being questioned by <num value="1">one</num> of the officers, he told him of his father having been taken prisoner, and, having no mother, he had no <num value="1">one</num> to care for him, and he wanted to fight his father's captors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>The officer tried to get him to turn back, but he was not to be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>So he succeeded in obtaining a musket, and went into the thickest of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>He finally by degrees crept up within a short distance of the rebel intrenchments, and posted himself behind a tree, from which he kept firing as often as he could see a head to fire at. He was soon discovered by the enemy's sharpshooters, who endeavored to drive him away from his position, as he kept picking them off very frequently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/><num value="1">One</num> of the rebels who was outside of the work got sight on the boy with his rifle, but before he got his piece off, the little warrior fired, and down went Mr. rebel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>As the rebel had a fine Minierifle, the boy ran out and picked it up, taking tine to get pouch and balls, together with his knapsack, while the bullets were flying on all sides of him, and then he retreated to his wooden breastwork, where he renewed his fire and with a little better success; and, after being in the fight all day, he returned to the <num value="78" type="ordinal">Seventy-eighth</num> at night with his prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>This story might appear incredible for <num value="1">one</num> so young to be the hero, but it is vouched for by a number of officers and men who saw the boy on the field and in the position mentioned, and many saw him shoot the rebel referred to, besides several others.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>Another case very similar to the last is that of <num value="1">one</num> of <orgName n="sharpshooters"><persName n="Birge,,,,," id="n0088.0315.00083.01150" reg="mostcommon:Birge,nomatch:0"><surname>Birge</surname></persName>'s sharpshooters</orgName>, who succeeded in getting within speaking distance of the fort, where he planted himself behind a stump, and by his unerring aim, succeeded in keeping <num value="1">one</num> of their guns silent during the whole day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>Every effort was made to dislodge him from his death-dealing position, but without effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>He kept it until the rebels, finding it to be certain death to attempt to man the gun, completely abandoned it.
