<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>So the day was kept; it was fragrant with love and flowers, and rich in precious memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>These marvels are no doubt accounted for in part by his great natural gifts, but also in large degree by the results of these fruitful years which he passed in study, discussion and debate with his gifted brother.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Amongst the subjects which engaged their special attention were political economy, political history and philosophy, and especially the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, its history, its construction and the true theory and nature of the government established <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Although not a professional lawyer, I make bold to say that <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0287.0004.00013.00182" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> became <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest constitutional lawyers that this country has ever produced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>He then became a thorough convert to what was known as the <rs>State</rs>'s rights school of politics, based upon the doctrine that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was a purely federal compact, enered into between sovereign and independent States, which did not, by entering into such a compact, forfeit or yield up their sovereignty, but had merely agreed to delegate certain powers to the federal government instituted thereby, as a common agent, without limitation as to time and subject to recall and reassumption by any <num value="1">one</num> of the sovereign principals that conferred them whenever in its judgment they had been abused or perverted to its injury.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/><persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0287.0004.00013.00183" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was a constant advocate of this doctrine from the beginning of his public career down to the last moment of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>He announced it with equal frankness when <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> proclaimed her right to secede from the <rs>Union</rs> because of the admission of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> as a State, as when his own <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> actually seoeded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The doctrine, perhaps, sounds strangely to-day in the ears of a generation which has been reared since the war under a constitution interpreted by the fiery edict of battle to import forever an indissoluble union, and under a defiant national government which brooks no denial of its sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>I am not here to arraign or question the finality of the dread arbitrament of war. I am not here to deny that the right of secession has been practically eviscerated from the constitution by the bloody Caesarian operation of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>I am not here even to deny that it may be better for us all and better for the world that such a settlement has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>I yield to none in patriotic devotion to the <rs>Union</rs> as it stands to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>I proclaim my readiness to cast in my lot and that of my posterity under the protection of the <q direct="unspecified">Indissoluble union of indestructible States</q> which has been established by the war, but speaking from the ante-bellum standpoint, viewing it as a purely historical question, in vindication of the cause for which our brothers and our fathers fought, I am bound to declare my unalterable conviction that the theory of the constitution, adopted and advocated by <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0287.0004.00013.00184" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and acted on by the <rs>Southern States</rs> when they seceded, was the true theory of that instrument as it was designed and came from the hands of its framers, and was the only theory upon which it could have ever secured the consent of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/><pb id="p.14" n="14"/></p> 
<p>The constitution had its origin in the exercise of the right of secession from the former's federal compact, which existed between the <name>States</name>, although the articles of confederation expressly declared that the union established thereby was to be a <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="Perpetual Union" type="union">perpetual union</orgName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Nobody had the temerity to propose such a provision in the new constitution, nor does it contain a word which hints at the surrender of this then acknowledged and asserted right of secession from the former federal compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>A proposition to invest the federal government with power to coerce a recalcitrant State was made in the convention, but was overwhelmingly defeated, and this denial of power to compel a State to remain in the union was surely, for all practical purposes, an acknowledgment of its right to secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Moreover, the conventions of several of the <name>States</name>, in their acts of ratification of the constitution, expressly reserved the right of the people of the <rs>State</rs> to reassume the powers delegated whenever they shall be perverted to their injury or such reassumption <q direct="unspecified">should become necessary to their happiness.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/></p> 
<p>Numerous attempts were made in the convention to impress on the government instituted by the constitution the character of nationality, but everyone was overwhelmingly defeated, and the most solicitous care was taken at every point and in every step to preserve its character as a purely federal compact between sovereign and and independent States which retained their inherent sovereignty, and all the powers pertaining thereto, except the carefully limited functions which were expressly delegated to the federal government as a common agent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>But I must not allow myself to be drawn into further discussion of this great question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Fortunately, <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0287.0004.00014.00185" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, aided by the exhaustive researches of <persName n="Bledsoe,,Albert,Taylor,," id="n0287.0004.00014.00186" reg="default:Bledsoe,Albert,Taylor,,"><foreName>Albert</foreName> <foreName>Taylor</foreName> <surname>Bledsoe</surname></persName> and of our distinguished and venerable fellow-citizen, <persName n="Sage,,B.,J.,," id="n0287.0004.00014.00187" reg="default:Sage,B.,J.,,"><foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Sage</surname></persName>, has formulated the whole argument in his <q direct="unspecified">Rise and Fall of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>I have recently re-read that matchless argument.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Speaking with all due temperance and strictly as a legal critic, I pronounce it <num value="1">one</num> of the most powerful and masterly legal and constitutional arguments of which I have any knowledge in the <rs>English</rs> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>In logical arrangement, in lucidity of expression, in closeness of reasoning, in the amplitude and precision with which it marshals the facts and evidence, in the candor and force with which it states and refutes the assumptions and arguments of his opponents, <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> in the admirable sobriety of its temper, it stands as a monument to his genius and as a model of constitutional exposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>It has never been answered, and it is unanswerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>It was intended and it serves as a complete vindication of the right of the <rs>Southern States</rs> to withdraw from the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, to terminate the compact which they had made with their sister States and to reassume the powers which had been delegated to the <rs>Federal</rs> government as a common agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Buried in the huge tomes of which it forms a part, this grand constitutional argument has not attracted the attention which it deserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>It is complete in itself, and I believe it would be a service to all the people of this country if it were published by itself in a small volume or pamphlet and disseminated throughout the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It should be read by every patriot, Northern as well as Southern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>It deals with what is to-day a purely historical question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>As citizens of a re-united country and a restored Union, living under a constitution from which all admit that the right of peaceable secession has been eliminated by the inveterate <hi rend="italics">res adjudicata</hi> of war, and, therefore, irrevocably bound together for weal or woe, we are all concerned in finding the true basis on which we may forever live together as friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The safest guarantee of the permanence of the <rs>Union</rs> and of peace, harmony, happiness and prosperity of our people must be found in the mutual respect and forbearance from insult of all sections of the people towards each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Nothing can conduce to this so powerfully as a true and correct understanding of the grounds and motives on which the <rs>Southern States</rs> acted when they seceded from the <rs>Union</rs>, and on which especially the people of those States, as well those who opposed as those who favored secession, believed it their duty to yield their allegiance to the <name>States</name> of which they were citizens.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>That was the era of senatorial giants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/><persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00201" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Clement,C.,,:3"><surname>Clay</surname></persName>, <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00202" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00203" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,W.,L.,,:1"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, <persName n="Benton,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00204" reg="mostcommon:Benton,nomatch:0"><surname>Benton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00205" reg="mostcommon:Seward,William,H.,,:4"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <persName n="Benjamin,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00206" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,Judah,P.,,:6"><surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00207" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,J.,O.,J.,:1"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00208" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, and a host of other men hardly less distinguished adorned its rolls and formed a galaxy of genius such as has rarely been gathered in any deliberative body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It is not too much to say that <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0287.0004.00017.00209" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> promptly took his place amongst the foremost of them all, and won speedy and universal recognition as inferior to none in power of debate, in forensic eloquence, in indomitable courage and tact, in breadth and depth of knowledge, and in masterly equipment for all the duties of practical and philosophic statesmanship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The times were stirring; the flames of sectional agitation and conflict which had smoldered since the <rs>Missouri</rs> compromise had been fanned into new life by the admission of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> as a State, and were now burning fiercely about the disposition which should be made of the territories of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> and <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>, recently acquired under the treaty with <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>, and of the remaining territories of the <rs>Louisiana</rs> purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It was a renewal of that fatal sectional strife between the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States, which continued to rage with growing fury and intensity until it culminated in the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs> and the consequent long and bloody war. It is important to have a just understanding of the true nature and scope of those controversies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>An entirely false conception of their true nature and scope has grown up and been assiduously cultivated to the effect that it was a contest between the essential principles of liberty and slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Nothing could be farther from the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Whatever may have <num value="2">2</num> <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> been the abstract opinions of individuals on either side; whatever may have been the ulterior designs of certain leaders of public opinion in the <rs>North</rs>; whatever may have been the logical tendency of doctrines of the <q direct="unspecified">irrepressible conflict</q> between liberty and slavery, and of the existence of <q direct="unspecified">a law higher than the constitution,</q> the fact remains that neither party to those controversies openly suggested or proposed the liberation of a solitary slave then held in bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>All agreed that the status of slavery as it existed in the <rs>Southern States</rs> was conclusively protected by the constitution, and could not be affected or impaired by any action of the <rs>Federal</rs> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Every assurance was offered the <rs>Southern States</rs> that slavery within their limits should not be interfered with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>In the compromise of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> the consideration which the <rs>Southern States</rs> received, freely offered and adopted by Northern votes, was the enactment by Congress of a more stringent law for the return of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Even after secession and while the war was flagrant, the <rs>Federal</rs> government emphatically proclaimed that it had no right, no power and no disposition to interfere with slavery in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>But for secession and the consequent war, and for emancipation avowedly adopted purely and solely as a war measure, there is no reason to doubt that slavery would be existing to-day just as it existed before the war, under the full protection of the constitution and laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The true question involved in these controversies was a question of <q direct="unspecified">balance of power</q> between the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Slavery, as a peculiar institution of the <rs>South</rs>, created a diversity and conflict of interests between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, and each was eager, in the admission of the new States, to secure allies which might contribute to the advancement and protection of its own interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Obviously, unless the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> could remove to the common <rs>Territories</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs>, carrying with them their property, these would inevitably be populated by settlers from the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and would come into the <rs>Union</rs> as free States, to swell the power and influence of the opposing section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The principle for which the <rs>Southern</rs> people contended was simply the doctrine of which we are to-day hearing so much&mdash;the principle that <q direct="unspecified">the constitution follows the flag,</q> and that the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, being the common property of all the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, acquired by the common blood and the common treasure, the constitution guaranteed to all the people the equal right of migrating to them, and of carrying <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> with them their property, of whatever nature, recognized and protected by the constitution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The Northern people, or at least the dominant majority of them, asserted the power and duty of Congress to exclude slavery from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and to prevent the citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs> from settling in the same, unless they abandoned and left behind them their slaves, which constituted their most valuable property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Although the present <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, by a bare majority of <num value="1">one</num>, has recently asserted the practical omnipotence of Congress over the territories free from constitutional restraints, the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> at that day took a different view, and in the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case gave its emphatic sanction to the contention of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It is needless to follow the history and developments of those memorable controversies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Suffice it to say that events occurred and conflicts arose which rendered impossible the continuance of a voluntary union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The predestined strife was not to be averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Passion usurped the seat of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Dissension swelled into defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Chiding grew into fierce recrimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Constant quarrel ripened into hate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/><num value="14">Fourteen</num> Northern States, in their so-termed <q direct="unspecified">personal liberty bills,</q> openly nullified the constitution in that very clause which had been the condition <hi rend="italics">sine qua non</hi> upon which the <rs>Southern States</rs> had acceded to the compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>A sectional party was formed upon a basis known and designed to exclude from its ranks the entire people of <num value="15">fifteen</num> States, and that party triumphed by an electoral majority which left no hope that it could ever be overcome.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Surely the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was not framed to meet or to fit such a condition of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It was a compact entered into between independent states for the declared purpose of promoting the <q direct="unspecified">common defense and general welfare,</q> and of <q direct="unspecified">insuring domestic tranquility.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>It was a league between friends, not between enemies; and when conditions arose which arrayed the sections in permanent conflict with each other, and changed their relations and feeling towards each other from friendship into enmity, he must have been blind, indeed, who could not see that the continuance of a voluntary union became impossible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>None saw more clearly or deprecated more deeply the inevitable result of the continuance of such a conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>He proclaimed on all occasions his love for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>He had spent almost his entire life in its service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Although <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> he was a firm believer in the right of secession, he regarded it as a last resort, only to be exercised in the last extremity, when all other means for securing harmony and a just respect for the rights of all under the constitution had hopelessly failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>With the prescience of a statesman, he saw, more clearly perhaps than any other man of his time, that the inevitable result of the conditions then existing must be the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, and he strove with all his might to avert it. He exhausted all his powers of luminous exegesis in expounding the true theory of the constitution, and of the relations thereunder of the <name>States</name> to each other and to the federal government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He lifted his voice in eloquent warning as to the sure result of sectional strife, as fatal to the continuance of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>He pleaded pathetically for the preservation of the <orgName n="Constitutional Union" type="union">constitutional union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>He made impassioned appeals to the patriotism of the northern people to respect the constitutional rights of the <name>States</name>, and to desist from their furious and insulting assaults upon the institutions of the <rs>South</rs>, for the existence of which the whole people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> shared an equal responsibility, and for the protection of which all the people of all the <name>States</name> were solemnly bound by the constitution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>These efforts he continued down to the last moments of his senatorial career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>He participated in the efforts of <persName n="Crittenden,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00020.00211" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> and of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00020.00212" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,J.,O.,J.,:1"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and of other conservative men to devise some compromise of the differences between the sections which might avert secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>He served on the committee appointed by the <name>Senate</name> to devise such a basis of amicable settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>In his last speech in the <name>Senate</name> before his retirement he said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/></p> 
<p>What, senators, to-day is the condition of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Is there a senator who does not daily receive letters appealing to him to use even the small power which <num value="1">one</num> man here possesses to save the rich inheritance our fathers gave us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Tears are trickling down the stern faces of men who have bled for the flag of their country, and who are willing now to die for it; but patriotism stands.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Is this the language of a cold-blooded conspirator?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Yet it is but <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> a sample of the ardent and eloquent appeals which <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0287.0004.00021.00213" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> made for the preservation of the <orgName n="Constitutional Union" type="union">constitutional union</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>In the actual movements taken by his State towards secession, he was not the leader, but the follower and moderator of his people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>He favored caution and delay in order to leave open, as long as possible, every chance for amicable arrangement, and he thereby incurred the criticism of his friends who were bent on immediate action, and who accused him of not being in heart with the movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>When all attempts at settlement had been met by determined and immovable opposition on the part of the dominant party, and when <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> had actually seceded and re-assumed her position as a sovereign State, nothing was left for <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0287.0004.00021.00214" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> but to yield his unqualified allegiance to the <rs>State</rs> of which he was a citizen, and to which he believed his allegiance was due.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>He had signified to his friends his preference for service as a soldier in the field, and supposed that he had guarded against any consideration of his name for the presidency, but when the delegates of the <name>States</name> assembled in convention for the purpose of organizing a provisional government, it proved to be their unanimous sentiment that <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0287.0004.00021.00216" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was the man of all others best fitted for the responsible position of <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>When he was informed of this unanimous action he felt compelled to yield his personal preferences and not to shirk the responsibility which was thrust upon him by the representatives of the people.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The wisdom of his administration of that high office has been subjected to that fierce criticism which always falls upon the heads of the leaders of lost causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>But when we consider the condition and environment of the <rs>Southern States</rs> when they entered upon this tremendous war&mdash;their lack of arms, of ammunition, of workshops, of factories, of trained mechanics, of ships of war and merchant vessels; their inadequate facilities of transportation, their agricultural condition, which had always been engaged in the production of articles for export, and had been dependent upon the <rs>Northern States</rs> for supplies of food and forage, their want, in fine, of everything which was essential to prepare a people for successful warfare; when we consider that they were specially cut off <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> by blockade from all communication with foreign countries; when we consider that they were thus thrown upon their own resources to extemporize the means of supplying all these wants; when we consider the enormous odds against which they had to contend, not only in numbers, but in every other conceivable advantage, and when we then reflect upon the magnificent contest which they maintained for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> against overwhelming odds, it is nothing short of childish folly to deny that the leader in such a contest must have been a man of exceptional character and ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The verdict of history which has already stamped the achievements of the <rs>South</rs> in that long and bloody war as amongst the most wonderful and heroic that were ever accomplished by any people, cannot fail to accord to <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0287.0004.00022.00218" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, as their leader from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, his full share of the credit and glory which belonged to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>He may have made mistakes, and doubtless did, but the incomparable morale of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> and people was largely inspired by the indomitable courage of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0287.0004.00022.00219" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and by their confidence that, whatever might befall, he would stand by his guns to the very last, and would never yield to anything less than the absolute destruction of all power of further resistance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>That confidence was fully justified by the event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>When ruin and defeat encompassed us on every side; when the <orgName>army of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0287.0004.00022.00220" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,Edward,,:19"><surname>Lee</surname></persName></orgName> had been, not defeated, but destroyed; when the <rs>Confederate</rs> capitol had fallen and the government was compelled to flee for safety, the indomitable southern chieftain wars still defiant, and was still busy and intent on schemes to rally the remains of his shattered forces, and to renew and maintain the fight as long as there remained a shot in the locker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Had he escaped, the history of the <rs>Confederate</rs> war might not have closed without a final chapter, which, owing to his surprise and capture, remained unwritten.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Something is to be forgiven to the intensity of excitement and resentment which prevailed at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Let us cast the mantle of charitable silence over the indignities, humiliations and unnecessary cruelties which for many months were visited upon a sick, helpless and defenceless prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The memory of them can serve no purpose, except to illustrate the heroic fortitude and undaunted spirit of their victim.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The floodgates of slander and obloquy were opened wide upon him, His character was distorted and vilified; he was painted as a monster of cruelty and cowardice, a vile conspirator who plotted the ruin of his country and deluged a continent in blood, with no better motive than to gratify a criminal ambition and to advance his personal interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>He was charged with being the instigator and abettor of the murder of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0287.0004.00023.00223" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, with all the malignity, but without the courage, of the actual assassin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>He had strong friendships and violent prejudices for individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>He was, perhaps, too blind to the shortcomings of his friends, and too intolerant to those of his enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>But whatever may be said of him, he was, from top to toe, a gentleman, in the highest acceptation of that word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>He had a fine and delicate sense of honor, which resented the slightest stain upon it as he would a blow in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>He had a chivalric courage, written in his martial bearing, and in his aqueline and defiant countenance, which shirked no conflict, but which always fought in the open, and scorned all indirect or underhand advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>He had, as is common with men of that type, a romantic tenderness for the weak and the dependent&mdash;as illustrated by the exquisite and inimitable courtesy and deference of his bearing towards women&mdash;by his delight in the society of children, and his charming faculty for attracting their confidence and affection&mdash;and by his gentle, just and humane treatment of his numerous slaves, which made them his devoted friends, whose respect and allegiance stood unshaken even after they became free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>His whole public life was pitched on the highest plane of devotion to duty and of inflexible adherence to principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It was, perhaps, his defect as a practical statesman that he scorned too much the politician's arts, and shrunk too sensitively from everything which involved a sacrifice of principle to expediency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>In private life he was a man whose word was ever his bond, scrupulously faithful to every engagement, sensitively <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> regardful of his obligations and the rights of others, with a lofty contempt of all sordid considerations&mdash;a man as incapable of soiling his conscience or his palm with the touch of filthy lucre not his own as ever <q direct="unspecified">lived in the tides of time.</q>

<p>Separated from that father at a tender age, nourished when yet at his mother's knee by those beautiful and pathetic letters in which the death-stricken parent solaced the years of pain and exile by pouring out his loving admonitions to the children he was never more to see on earth, the susceptible heart of the boy imbibed for his absent sire a devotion which grew with his growth and which contributed in large degree to shape his own career in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Later the lonely grave in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> appealed to his imagination, and the influence of its silent occupant was more potent than that of most living parents upon their sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>The faded letters from the <name>Indies</name> became sacred precepts to the lad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>It is not too much to assume that the idolized leader of the sire became thus the ideal hero of the scion; and that the son of that <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> orator, who embalmed the virtues of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> in words as deathless, was led by paternal influences&mdash;none the less strong because speaking from the grave&mdash;to consciously mould himself upon the almost faultless pattern so faultlessly portrayed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>Both were left fatherless while of plastic minds, and both were trained to scarcely realize that partial orphanage by mothers to whom widowhood was but a trusteeship of love and care for the offspring of a departed consort.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>'Twas she who guided the young <rs>Aeneas</rs> to filial piety, and taught him veneration of all that was best and noblest in the father's creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>The same gracious gravity of demeanor and dignity of deportment gave early presage in both of powers beyond the common heritage and of destinies beyond the common lot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>In the midst of difficulties for which there was no human remedy both displayed a patient fortitude almost superhuman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Both were of constant minds, of patient courage; neither elated by success nor depressed by failure.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>More potent still to fix his path was the silent appeal of a sword which hung above the lofty mantel&mdash;the sword which <orgName type="mil" key="LightCav">Light Horse</orgName> <persName><foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> had flashed so often in the headlong charge&mdash;the sword presented to him by Congress for <q direct="unspecified">Warlike skill and prowess.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>In this church, it was my privilege to be brought up, and its dear old rector was my father in the faith, as ever <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0287.0014.00155.01678" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> was such to <persName><foreName>Timothy</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>With boys of that day&mdash;certainly with me&mdash;it was as customary to go to church on Sunday as it was to go to school during the week, and this memorable <name>Sunday</name> found me in my proper place, and yet, by a strange accident, not exactly in my place either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>Our famliy pew was <num value="15">No. 15</num>, and here along with the family I usually sat, but on this particular <name>Sunday</name>, for some reason I cannot now recall, I was allowed to go up into the gallery, which I well remember to have considered a great privilege and liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>The church on that day was thronged as usual, and my seat on the front row of pews was on exact line with the <rs>President</rs>'s pew down stairs, so that I not only saw him, but had a full view of the congregation except that portion immediately beneath me. It was inspiring to look down on that throng of beautiful women and fine-looking men assembled to worship Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>But this was as nothing compared to the scene destined to take place then and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>For it was here that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0287.0014.00155.01679" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:78"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was notified that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0287.0014.00155.01680" reg="nearbymention:Lee,C.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s lines had been broken, and <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would have to be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>How can I describe how this was done, and the wild terrific scene which followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>The morning service proper had been concluded, and <persName n="Minnigerode,Doctor,,,," id="n0287.0014.00155.01681" reg="nearbymention:Minnigerode,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Minnigerode</surname></persName> was delivering <num value="1">one</num> of his stirring and fervid communion addresses (for the communion was to follow), when the sexton of the church was seen to walk up the aisle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>He was a large, pompous, swaggering kind of a fellow, whose <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> costume at the time was a faded blue suit with brass buttons and a shirt with waving ruffles at the bosom and wrists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>His supreme delight, aside from keeping us boys in order, was seemingly to walk up the aisle with a message for some <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>On this occasion his manner was in perfect keeping with his usual consequential air, only it was more so, for this time he was the bearer of a message to the <rs>President</rs> of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>Gently and respectfully touching <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0287.0014.00155.01682" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:78"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> on the shoulder, he handed him something, whereupon the latter immediately arose and <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> left the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>I have often thought since then that moment must have been the most trying <num value="1">one</num> in <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0287.0014.00156.01683" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:78"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s remarkable career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>Yet, whatever his feelings, and they must have been excruciating, his self-control was perfect, and he withdrew from the sacred edifice with a quiet grace and dignity that was not only superb, but well calculated to disarm suspicion and allay excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>I can see now his lithe, erect, stately figure as it disappeared down the aisle, and I shall never forget it, for it was the last time I ever saw him. His withdrawal was so quiet that the service was in no wise interrupted, and I believe it would have been concluded in the usual way but for what followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>Hardly had <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0287.0014.00156.01684" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:78"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> disappeared than the sexton came in again and spoke to <persName n="Anderson,General,Joseph,R.,," id="n0287.0014.00156.01685" reg="default:Anderson,Joseph,R.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, who at once went out. This made people look up and shoot inquiring glances at each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>Then the sexton came again, and the excitement became manifest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>But when the sexton appeared the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> time, all restraint of place and occasion yielded, and the vast congregation rose en masse and rushed towards the doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>I sat still for a moment, wondering and withal listening to the preacher's earnest appeal to the people to remember where they were and be still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>Good <persName n="Minnigerode,Doctor,,,," id="n0287.0014.00156.01686" reg="nearbymention:Minnigerode,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Minnigerode</surname></persName>, he might just as well have tried to turn back the waters of <placeName reg="Niagara Falls, Niagara, New York" key="tgn,7014229">Niagara Falls</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>Something had happened; and the congregation knew it without being told, and nothing could have kept the people in the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>At any rate nothing did, and I went along with the crowd, excited and alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>If the scene in the church was all excitement, outside the vast crowd that thronged the spacious church porch and the pavement beyond was standing for the most part in dumb, bewildered silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>I shall never forget the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing which met my eyes as I gained the open street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>Just across the street in a large house there were a number of government offices, and before these, in the middle of the street, were several piles of government documents burning their way to destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>I think these burning papers were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intelligent intimation the people had of what was occurring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>They told me, as they told others, and it was pathetic to see that crowd melt away, too full of forebodings and anguish to express the surprise and despair which possessed every mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>I have no recollection how the rest of that <name>Sunday</name> was spent, but I do remember that before it closed there was a widespread impression that the rumors and fears of the early morning were false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>When my father's friend, <persName n="Harrison,Doctor,,,," id="n0287.0014.00156.01687" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,Burton,N.,,:3"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Harrison</surname></persName>, came home that night he told us it was a false alarm; that there had been a crisis, but it was <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> safely passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>It may seem strange, but such was our unwillingness to believe the worst, and such our confidence in <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0287.0014.00157.01688" reg="nearbymention:Lee,C.,C.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his army, that in the absence of any official announcement we all went to bed that night feeling little or no concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>I do not know how many others in the city did this, but we did, and, what is more, we slept the sleep of the just until suddenly awakened in the early hours of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> by a tremendous shock, which rocked the house and rattled the windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we thought it was an earthquake, but very soon concluded, from the terrific report, it must be an explosion of some kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>It was not long before we learned it was, in fact, the blowing up of the government powder magazine just beyond the city limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>Then we knew for sure the fears of the day before were not idle fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>With the advancing morning all doubts were dissipated, and as the sun rose it shone with fiery redness through a dense blackness, which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we took to be heavy clouds, but soon saw was in reality a great volume of smoke passing over the city from south to north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/><placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse, as this became a settled fact, was to go and see for myself what was happening in the lower part of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>I was deterred, however, from carrying out this impulse at once by certain household duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>I had to go to market, and my experience there must not go unnoticed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>Food was the scarcest thin, in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> towards the close of the war. Money, such as it was, was the most plentiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>It seemed to grow on trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>At the time of the evacuation, we had an unusual quantity of it, which, in consequence of its bulk, was kept in a box in a closet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>Arming myself with the inconsiderable sum of <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>, I sallied forth to make such purchases as I might be able to do f)r our day's need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>When I arrived at the market-house I found only <num value="1">one</num> butcher's stall open, and noticing here a piece of mutton about as big as my <num value="2">two</num> fiats, I asked the price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>It was only after some persuasion that the kindly butcher let me have it for <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">$250</measure>, which I paid at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>Then seeing a grocery store open on the next square, I went there, and offered to purchase several things, but could only get <num value="3">three</num> quarts of blackeye peas, for which I paid <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">$25</measure> a quart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>This closed my marketing operations for that day, and I went home with <hi rend="italics">my</hi> mutton and peas in my basket, and <measure n="175dollars" type="currency">$175</measure> change in my pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>I h id some feeling, as I did so, that I had been greatly imposed on by these voracious merchants, but events showed me, and I have ever since thought those purchases the cheapest I ever made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>Free now to indulge myself, I started off down town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>On my way I was joined by several friends of about my age,&mdash;&mdash;, <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> now <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>'s most distinguished lawyers;&mdash;&mdash;, at present a leading merchant of the same place;&mdash;&mdash;, now dead, and others whose names I cannot recall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>Together we hastened down <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, and soon stood face to face with a fire, which was destined, as the day grew longer, to lay in ashes almost the whole of the business portion of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>At that early hour it had not reached much north of <address><street n="Cary street">Cary street</street></address>, but such was its fierceness and the rapidity with which it was spreading that, in sheer despair, warehouse after warehouse was thrown open, and the gathered crowd of hungry, despairing people were told to go in and help themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>Pell-mell they went, without regard to position in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>I remember to have seen <num value="1">one</num> of the richest men in the city going up the street with what I was told was a bolt of <rs n="red flannel" type="product">red flannel</rs> under <num value="1">one</num> arm and a bolt of something else under the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>Naturally I and my friends, like others, suited our action to the opportunity, and to the word of permission, and went in where to some extent angels might have feared to tread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>For there was some danger in doing this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>I remember how several times, when we were on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story floor of a large building, the cry would be raised: <q direct="unspecified">This building is on fire; get out quickly</q>; and down we would scramble, only to try our fortune elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>I do not recall how long this looting continued, but the net result of it was ridiculously small, as I remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>We had all filled our hands, our pockets, and our arms with such things as we could find, and when the pillaging was over, we each had a great variety of things of <num value="1">one</num> kind or another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Some had, however, more shoes, or more stockings, or more of something else than others, and we decided to equalize things by exchanging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>With this in view we went to an alley running from Main to <address><street n="Cary street">Cary street</street></address>, where we dumped the booty into <num value="1">one</num> pile, and proceeded to distribute it equally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>I remember the spot well, not only because of what has already been said, but because it was while standing here, thus engaged, that we were startled by the cry: <q direct="unspecified">The <rs>Yankees</rs> are coming.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>And, sure enough, there came the advance guard of the <rs>Federal</rs> army up <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>. Now we were, or at least we thought we were, a lot of very brave fellows, but I must say the alarm and sight of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops so demoralized the whole crowd that we took to our heels, leaving almost all of our booty in the alley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>The only thing I took home with me was a pair of rough, tanned, brogan shoes, such as corn-field hands might wear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>These, however, I did save, and in the hard times that followed they were the only shoes I had for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/><pb id="p.159" n="159"/></p> 
<p>In the excitement and stampede which followed the appearance of the <rs>Northern</rs> army our party became separated, and I have no recollection of how the others reached their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>But what happened to me is as distinct in my mind to-day as it was the day after it occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>I was living at that time on <address><street n="7 Street">Seventh street</street></address>, between <address><street n="Clay street">Clay</street></address> and <address><street n="Leigh street">Leigh</street></address>, and my most direct way home was to go diagonally through the <rs type="place">Capitol Square</rs>, entering it at <address><street n="11 Street">Eleventh</street></address> and <address><street n="Bank Street">Bank streets</street></address> and leaving it at <num value="9" type="ordinal">Ninth</num> and <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">Capitol</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>This route I took.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>It carried me by the old <placeName reg="Library Building">Library Building</placeName>, since destroyed, then by the front of the <rs>Capitol</rs> itself, and so by the <rs>Washington Monument</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>When I arrived here my experiences of the day reached a final climax.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>When I started up town a few minutes before, the <rs>Federal</rs> advance force of occupation was coming up <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>. This street was followed until <address><street n="9 Street">Ninth street</street></address> was reached, where a turn was made to the north in the direction of <placeName reg="St. Paul's Church">St. Paul's Church</placeName>, and just as I reached the <rs>Washington Monument</rs>, I was little less than horrified to see the troops entering the <rs type="place">Square</rs> through the main entrance facing <address><street n="Grace street">Grace street</street></address>. In my youth I was not, at least, notoriously either a bad or cowardly boy, but that sight, so new and unexpected, was rather too much for my surprised nerves, and for <num value="1">one</num> thing I quickly betook myself to the largest tree I could find and hid myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Here I stood as the soldiers swept into the <rs type="place">Square</rs>, passed the <name>Monument</name>, and went on to, the <rs>Capitol</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>It was then only a few minutes later&mdash;so my memory serves me&mdash;that I saw the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag appear on the flag-pole above, where the <name>Stars</name> and Bars had floated for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/><measure n="4years" type="date">Four years</measure> before this, on a day, I think, in this same month of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, my father, always a strong secessionist, had taken me to this same Square to a great meeting in ratification of the ordinance of secession, and I recollect to have seen then the flag of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> raised on the <rs>Capitol</rs> where the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> had waved from time immemorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>Putting the <num value="2">two</num> things together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>I have often said that, as a boy, I saw the <rs>Alpha</rs> and <rs>Omega</rs>&mdash;the beginning and the end&mdash;of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> in old <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>As to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I was, of course, far too young to be in any way affected by it, but as to the latter, I must say, as I stood behind that tree and saw what I saw, I remembered my dead soldier brother, what we had suffered for what we deemed right, and my young heart was filled with bitter hate, and my lips, which had never before uttered an oath, poured maledictions on our triumphant foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>Then I went home, and so practically closed those <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> in my <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> life, which of all others will ever stand forth as living, dreadful pictures before my mind.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>The party declined to give his name or authority, or in any way to explain his conduct, and it was natural, therefore, that my father declined positively to leave the house at that unearthly hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>I am sorry to say, some pretty strong language was used on both sides, but the immediate result was, the man left, not, however, without threatening us with all kinds of horrible things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>We thought the episode strange, but considered it closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>But this was by no means the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>Early in the morning our cook came rushing into the house, saying it was surrounded by soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>It was even so. They were on the front porch and back porch, they were in the street and side alley&mdash;they were everywhere, bristling with arms, and under orders to allow no <num value="1">one</num> to go in or out. In my simplicity, I, remember starting out into the yard to look after some chickens, and being sent back at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>We were prisoners, not knowing why, and so we remained, shut up and ignorant, for hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>About <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> in the day, an officer of low rank&mdash;and, I must think, of lower character-grain&mdash;appeared, saying, with chilling coldness, he had orders to search the house for <persName n="Tucker,Mister,Beverley,,," id="n0287.0014.00161.01701" reg="default:Tucker,Beverley,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Beverley</foreName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>When told that he was not in the house, and had not been there, the man simply told us we lied, and proceeded to show that he honestly thought so. He looked in the closets and under the beds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>He looked between the mattresses and up the chimney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>He looked in every nook and corner, and when this search proved unsuccessful, he proceeded to look for clues of my uncle's whereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>In doing this he was absolutely without mercy, or even decency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>He ransacked bureau-drawers, rummaged through trunks, and sitting down, as to a specially sweet morsel, he read much of our private family correspondence, all the while commenting on what he read in the most impertinent and insulting manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>After he had done all he could, he demanded to know where my uncle was, saying it was perfectly well known by the authorities that he had been in the house the night before; that <persName n="Dent,General,,,," id="n0287.0014.00161.01702" reg="mostcommon:Dent,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dent</surname></persName> had heard him spoken to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>Whether he believed us or not, I do not know, but at any rate, as there was nothing else to do, he took his departure, withdrew the soldiers, and we were left to life, liberty, and something to eat. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/><num value="1">One</num> morning we were much surprised, and, indeed, somewhat startled, by seeing a very distinguished-looking man, wearing the insignia of a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> general, stop and dismount before our front door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>He was accompanied, I think, by his staff, in full uniform, and was followed, not unnaturally, by quite a crowd of negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>Of course, I did not know either who it was or what he wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>Just as he asked, in the kindliest tones, if <persName n="Tucker,Doctor,,,," id="n0287.0014.00162.01710" reg="nearbymention:Tucker,Beverley,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName> lived there, my little sister, a flaxen-haired girl, appeared in the hall, and, with a smile on his face, the <rs>General</rs> quickly said: <q direct="unspecified">I know he does, for that child is the image of her mother</q>&mdash;calling my mother by her maiden name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>Then he told who he was, and asked for my mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>He was shown into our little parlor, and soon the latter came in also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>Naturally, both seemed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a little awkward, and bowed stiffly&mdash;my mother especially, I think&mdash;and sat down, when a silence ensued, which neither party seemed to know exactly how to break.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>As a matter of fact, it was broken at last by the <rs>General</rs>, in tones of deep sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>These words, spoken in such quiet dignity, yet with so much warm sympathy, broke the icy reserve, and, in the conversation which followed, not only were many pleasant things said on both sides, but the good offices of the <rs>General</rs> were <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> pledged and gratefully accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>Let it be said, he was true to every offer, and among his many, many subsequent kindnesses, he secured for my mother and the children, excepting myself, free tranportation to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>It has been asserted that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0287.0019.00178.01960" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, a short time before the collapse of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, advised the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities that further resistance was useless, and that he recommended a cessation of hostilities upon the best terms that could be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>This suggestion <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> was adopted, and all the <rs>Virginia</rs> representatives, <num value="15">fifteen</num> in number, by the invitation of the <rs>President</rs>, met him, his cabinet, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0287.0019.00179.01967" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, in the afternoon of the same day, at <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>He referred to the length of the line he was obliged to defend, to the number of effective men, and the great scarcity of food for his soldiers and forage for his animals; but he did not say nor did he intimate in any manner whatever, that in his opinion the cause was lost, and that the time for surrender had come.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>That the <rs>Monroe Doctrine</rs> assumed the position that no European Power should impose governments upon any peoples on this continent against their will; that the principle of the sovereign right of local self-government was peculiarly sacred to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as well as to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>; that the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> was at that time attempting to violate this great principle in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; that the suspension of hostilities and allowance of time for the blood of our people on both sides to cool towards each other, would probably lead the public mind to a clearer understanding of those principles which ought to constitute the basis of the settlement of existing difficulties; that the settlement of the <rs>Mexican</rs> question in this way would necessarily lead to a peaceful settlement of our own; that whenever it should be determined that this right of local self-government is the principle on which all American institutions rest, all the <name>States</name> might reasonably be expected to return of their own accord to their former relations to the <rs>Union</rs> just as they came together at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by their own consent and for their mutual interests; that we might become indeed and in truth an oceanbound Federal Republic, under the operation of this continental regulator, the ultimate, absolute sovereignty of each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>It would be held to apply only to such slaves as had come under its operation while it was in active exercise.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>Taking <num value="1">one</num> man with me, I mounted my horse and galloped rapidly down the road until I came within sight of the camp fires of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4530"/>Dismounting, I tied my horse in a thicket near the road, advanced cautiously, expecting every moment to come in contact with some outlying picket, but met no enemy until I came to an opening in the woods, overlooking a large field, where I saw a sight most amazing and unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4531"/>No less than a vast force of Federals in every conceivable state of disorder, without any formation; several batteries of artillery unlimbered; hundreds gathered around the camp fires cooking, some lying sunning themselves in the bright <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> sunshine, as apparently unconscious of danger as if they had been encamped around the environs of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>&mdash;no sentinels, no pickets, no line of battle anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/></p> 
<p>And so the movement commenced slowly, silently, with no sound save the occasional cracking of a stick beneath the feet of the men; those long grey lines stretching far into the gloom of the forest, pressed on; <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> veterans of many a hard fought field, who had never moved save in the path of victory; on and on in the gathering evening, the sinking sun casting long shadows behind them, the frightened birds twittering and chirping as they flew from tree to tree, and an occasional bark of a squirrel as he looked out, startled at the unwonted scene, were the only sounds that interrupted the stillness, solemn and oppressive; a strange calm preceding a storm, the light of which has rarely been chronicled in the annals of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>When our line of battle debouched from the dense wood which effectually concealed the advance, it came immediately upon the <rs>Federal</rs> encampment and directly in the rear of their whole line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4548"/>When night closed upon the scene the victory seemed to be complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4549"/>The infantry of the enemy had disappeared from our immediate front, falling back under cover of several batteries of artillery, which, halting upon every eminence, poured a furious fire of shot and shell down the road upon our advancing columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4570"/>The men in line on our left, excited apparently by this fire, commenced firing across the road into the woods beyond, not in regular volleys, but in a desultory way, without order, here and there along the line.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4573"/>Those immediately in my front would cease as I gave the order, but the firing would break out above or below me, and instead of decreasing the shots increased in frequency, I rode back to <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0287.0044.00334.03991" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and said: <q direct="unspecified">General, it is impossible to stop these men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4576"/>A few more seconds would have placed us in safety, for we were not over <measure n="3yards" type="distance">three yards</measure> from the line, but as we turned, looking up and down as far as my eye could reach, I saw that long line of shining bayonets rise and concentrate upon us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4577"/>I looked back as my horse made the leap, and everything had gone down like leaves before the blast of a hurricane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4581"/>My own horse was wounded in several places, my clothes and saddle <pb id="p.335" n="335"/> were perforated with bullets, yet I escaped without a wound, the only living man to tell the fearful story.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4582"/>As soon as I could control my horse, rendered frantic by his wounds, I rode among our men, who were falling back into the woods, and from behind the trees were still continuing that reckless and insane fire, and urging them to form their line and come back to the road, telling them that they had fired not upon the enemy, but upon <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0287.0044.00335.03994" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and his escort.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4658"/>A few <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> were killed in the streets of the town, and from <num value="1">one</num> of these I took a new canteen, of which I had need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4659"/>After we marched through the town, we advanced a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> and struck camp in a deep ravine, where we remained until late in the afternoon of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day's battle.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4664"/>Our brigade charged in good order until we were within a short distance of the stone fence, which did not extend all the way across the face of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4665"/>Here the brigade spread out across the face of the hill, part of the men making for the ends of the fence, as I recollect.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4667"/>About <num value="20">twenty</num> men attached to the <rs>Louisiana</rs> brigade crossed the fence about the same time we did. We turned some of the guns on the enemy and tried to fire them, but most of them had been spiked by the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>The history of the antecedent period covering the anti-slavery agitation has also been written up, for the most part with bias and partisanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/>The military events of the <num value="4">four</num>-years' struggle have also been exhibited in official reports, documents, memoirs, and narratives of every kind and description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>The material for this history exists in abundance; but, though passion is subsiding it would still be difficult to prepare a work satisfactory to both sides of this great controversy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>Some ambitious attempts have been recently made to supply this omission by persons whose means of obtaining accurate information were quite limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>Since the struggle closed some persons have made criticisms based partly on public documents with a certain amount of added misrepresentation, relying on the prevalent sectional prejudice for their market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>With some others of late the motives seem to have been to provide sensation and to make money and bold assertions, trusting to luck and the lapse of time to prevent exposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>The regular rebel yell was then raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>Then across a level plain, through an old field, over deep gullies, for about <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> we charged the enemy in his stronghold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>We got to within about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> of their lines, when we delivered our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>At this time I kept moving on toward them, not thinking that our lines would retreat or fall back after getting that near, although the fire from the enemy's triple lines was furious, and the boys began to waver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>Just then <persName n="Archer,General,,,," id="n0287.0048.00352.04144" reg="mostcommon:Archer,J.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Archer</surname></persName> waved his sword over his head, and gave the command: <q direct="unspecified">Follow me!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>I raised on my hands like a lizzard on a fence rail and took in the situation as best I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>I soon decided if I could get up I had better do so. It seemed like death either way, but I determined to make the effort to get away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>I got up but I found I could not walk, and if I made the trip at all I would have to drag my leg. I grasped my wounded leg with my right hand and started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>Just then I saw <num value="4">four</num> of the boys lying down, but I could not tell whether they were all dead or not. I made my way back, dragging my leg, under a galling fire, when a minie ball struck my left wrist, and tore it up and took off my thumb at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>I mended my gait a little toward a deep gully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>Before I reached it I looked back to see if the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Yanks,,,,," id="n0287.0048.00352.04145" reg="mostcommon:Yanks,nomatch:0"><surname>Yanks</surname></persName></q> were coming, and just at that moment a ball drew a little blood from under my chin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>A few more hops and I tumbled down into the deep gully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>I wanted to stay there, but the boys insisted that as I was badly wounded I had better try and get to the rear or I would be captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/><pb id="p.353" n="353"/></p> 
<p>That scared me up. The thought of being captured and lying in a northern prison in my condition was horrible.
