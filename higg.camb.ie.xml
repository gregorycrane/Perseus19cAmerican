<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Laid out originally by <persName n="Winthrop,Governor,John,,," id="n0157.0001.00000.00001" reg="default:Winthrop,John,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Winthrop</surname></persName> as a fortified town,--furnished soon after with a <quote>pallysadoe,</quote> of which the large willows on <placeName reg="Holmes's Field">Holmes's Field</placeName> are the last lingering memorial,--it might nevertheless have gone the way of many abortive early settlements, had it not been for the establishment of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>We <placeName>Cambridge</placeName> boys early learned, however, that this event was due mainly to the renown attained, as a preacher and author, by <persName n="Shepard,Reverend,Thomas,,," id="n0157.0001.00000.00002" reg="default:Shepard,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Shepard</surname></persName>, known in his day as <quote>the holy, heavenly, sweet-affecting, and soul-ravishing <persName n="Shepard,Mister,,,," id="n0157.0001.00000.00003" reg="nearbymention:Shepard,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Shepard</surname></persName>,</quote> a graduate of <orgName n="Emmanuel College" type="college">Emmanuel College</orgName>, <placeName reg="Cambridge,Cambridgeshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge, England</placeName>, who <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> came to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>A voluminous author, some of whose works are yet reprinted in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, he was the ruling spirit of the <rs type="place">Cambridge synod</rs>, which was held in <dateStruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></dateStruct> to pronounce against <quote>antinomian and familistic opinions.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The place was, like many country parsonages of that day, practically a farmhouse with its accompanying acres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It included the ground now covered by several college buildings in the neighborhood and it extended over the playgrounds now called <placeName reg="Holmes's Field">Holmes's Field</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>There were cultivated fields and many outbuildings, sheltering horses and cattle; and <num value="1">one</num> of the happiest spots to us was the corn-barn, raised on high posts, where we shelled corn on rainy days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>In the house our favorite playing place was the garret described by <persName n="Holmes,Doctor,,,," id="n0157.0003.00077.00403" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> in his <quote>Professor at the breakfast table.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>It was in reference to this garret that he wrote, <quote>The worst of a modern stylish mansion is that it has no place for ghosts.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>In this garret there was abundant room for them; it possessed locked closets for their express accommodation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/><pb id="p.78" n="78"/> Looking in through the keyholes we could see old leather portmanteaux looking <quote>like stranded porpoises,</quote> as <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0157.0003.00078.00404" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName> describes them, or andirons waiting to resume their places in the chimneys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>In the large outer garret we could see names written with diamonds on the windowpanes &mdash; names of students who had taken their degrees before the <rs>Revolutionary War</rs>. Among them was the name of <persName n="Tracy,,John,,," id="n0157.0003.00078.00405" reg="default:Tracy,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Tracy</surname></persName>, beneath which some <num value="1">one</num>, possibly a rival in scholarship or love, had written <hi rend="italics">stultus</hi> by way of brief verdict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>We knew that in this house the <rs n="Battle of Bunker Hill" type="battle">battle of Bunker Hill</rs> was planned, and we knew that on yonder green the <rs>American</rs> soldiers had halted for prayers from the college president ere they marched to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Looking across the common, then unfenced, we saw the tree beneath which <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0157.0003.00078.00406" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> had taken command of the <rs>Continental Army</rs>, and not far off was the old churchyard, and <persName n="Holmes,Doctor,,,," id="n0157.0003.00078.00407" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> had made that plot of ground classic to us by poems which we knew by heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>We pondered over those long inscriptions where, as <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0157.0003.00078.00408" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName> himself has said, <quote>The dead presidents stretched their weary bones under epitaphs stretched out at as full <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> length as their subjects.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>We chose out the very stone he describes in the poem, <quote>The empty urn of pride</quote> as he calls it &mdash; the tomb of the <name>Vassall</name> family bearing only <quote>the goblet and the sun</quote> (Vas-sol) until desecrated in these later years by the addition of name and date.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The force of this was not diminished to us by the fact that the little <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> maidens with whom we went to dancing school might frequently be seen wandering through the churchyard; and that curls were then so universally worn, it really seemed as if the damsels might have put them on with their straw hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Perhaps more interesting to us <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> than any of these localities was the grave of our poet's sister, of whom <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0157.0003.00080.00410" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName> wrote:--<quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="pentameter"><l>If sinless angels love as we</l> <l>Who stood that bier beside,</l> <l><num value="3">Three</num> seraph welcomes greeted thee,</l> <l>The daughter, sister, bride.</l></lg></quote> And we faithfully took the poet's word for it that the locust grove in the churchyard would <quote>swing its orient flowers</quote> long after the <num value="2">two</num> church spires had crumbled, although now, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>the grove has long since disappeared, and the steeples remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>All this had been a part of <persName n="Holmes,Doctor,,,," id="n0157.0003.00080.00411" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName>'s boyhood, as of mine, and he like me had also <quote>tumbled about in a library,</quote> namely, his own father's, though <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> earlier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>There was an inexhaustible set of volumes in it, placed near the floor as if for children to reach &mdash; the delightful quartos of <quote><persName n="Rees,,,,," id="n0157.0003.00080.00412" reg="mostcommon:Rees,nomatch:0"><surname>Rees</surname></persName>' Cyclopaedia,</quote> whose numerous plates of baboons and paroquets were to us of endless interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>If perchance their attraction waned, there was always the resource of building fortresses on the floor with the kindly quartos and playing the <rs n="Battle of Bunker Hill" type="battle">battle of Bunker Hill</rs> behind them, using for ammunition the store of winter apples then kept <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> in barrels within the closet of every faithful and studious clergyman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>He was at this time a young physician of great promise, which was thought to be rather impaired by his amusing himself with poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>So at least, he always thought; and he cautioned in later years a younger physician, <persName n="Mitchell,Doctor,Weir,,," id="n0157.0003.00082.00417" reg="default:Mitchell,Weir,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Weir</foreName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, to avoid the fault which he had committed, advising him to be known exclusively as a physician until his reputation in that line should be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The effect of levity conveyed by this poem &mdash; which was in the main a serious, not to say a ponderous, <num value="1">one</num>--was due largely to certain passages which he described as <quote>wanting in dignity</quote> and only partly reprinted in an appendix.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Especially criticised was <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> passage in which he gallantly enumerated the probable names of the various young ladies in the gallery, mentioning, for instance, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>These statistics of admiration were not thought altogether suitable to an academic poem, and the claim itself in regard to the young lady may have proved a little premature, inasmuch as she subsequently married <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0157.0003.00083.00418" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,O.,W.,,"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName>'s friend <persName n="Motley,,,,," id="n0157.0003.00083.00419" reg="mostcommon:Motley,J.,L.,,:1"><surname>Motley</surname></persName>, the historian.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It is to be remembered, however, that he had at this period a look of physical insignificance, which his middle years greatly amended by additional flesh; at Phi Beta Kappa dinners he used to stand up in a chair to sing his songs, and his juvenile look was even considered something of an obstacle to his early <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> success in medical practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>He varied it by much vivacious social life and by a good deal of lecturing before the popular lyceums then so much in vogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>He met, however, this obstacle in lecturing, as sometimes in literature, that he made very abrupt transitions from humor to pathos, so that his hearers did not always follow him; and sometimes, when the joke was over and he had suddenly passed into deep emotion, they would not recognize the change of key and would laugh harder than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>He was at this time, as always, a perpetual fountain of original thought and illustration, but did not seem a man of strong convictions, and was essentially conservative in attitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The accounts of slave insurrections and of the imaginary New York negro plot had left upon his mind, as he himself said, <quote>impressions which it took <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0157.0003.00085.00424" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,W.,L.,,:1"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> years to root out</quote> ; he was easily moved to wrath at phrenology, homoeopathy, and all the pseudosciences as he called them; but almost equally disapproved the prevailing taste for <name>German</name> literature, calling <persName n="Paul,,Jean,,," id="n0157.0003.00085.00425" reg="default:Paul,Jean,,,"><foreName>Jean</foreName> <surname>Paul</surname></persName>, in <num value="1">one</num> poem, <quote>a German-Silver Spoon.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The Civil War on the <num value="1">one</num> side and some tilts against theological prejudices, on the other, had the effect of throwing him in later life toward the party of attack, and, as almost always happens in such cases, this seemed a source of fresh life and happiness to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>He disarmed criticism in the end by courageously persisting in the same method which had originally produced it, namely, by the most fearless intimacy with his audience, never keeping back any jest or any expression of confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>He frankly says in <num value="1">one</num> place that good talkers are very apt to be bores,--thus meeting criticism halfway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The discursiveness of his articles only matches the same quality of his mind; and there probably never was a man whose conversation and whose writing were so little unlike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>I knew <num value="1">one</num> celebrated talker in <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> who astonished a dinner party <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> by reciting the birthdays of all the <rs>British</rs> queens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>He had no marked development of systematic memory, but his accumulation of odds and ends of knowledge was unsurpassed, and this is what a talker, or indeed a literary man as such, chiefly needs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>His ready wit supplied the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>It is to be noticed also that he had an arsenal of his own in a scientific direction from which he could draw weapons not accessible to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>He mercilessly talked down other talkers, yet not by a strategy, only through an irrepressible affluence which left them no room.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>There was a legend that he once met in the street the late <rs>Tom Appleton</rs>, at that time the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> best talker in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, who told him a capital story.

With an unconcealed preference for what is called the best society, he yet had, in his early medical practice, the advantage enjoyed by all of that profession, in alternating between the houses of rich and poor, and learning that they are composed mentally, as physically, of much the same material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>A. [Alcott], whose orbit never, even by chance, intersects the plane of the modern earth, proposed that we should call ourselves <quote>Olympians.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>Upon this I suggested to W. H. C.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>E. [Emerson] has changed a good deal since his visit to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>He has becomenot at all more worldly-but more of this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>The practical sense of <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n0157.0005.00168.00799" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> seems to have impressed him, and he is resolved to be practical too. His lecture on <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was not good, for him. There was <num value="1">one</num> thing in it that especially pleased me. He did not even allude to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>His favorite theory (you know) is the highest culture of the individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>He would think a nation well wasted if it brought <num value="1">one</num> man to perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>Accordingly his whole view was of the upper class &mdash; their beauty, their pluck, their fine persons, their healthiness, &amp;c. The people he clearly regarded as the dung for those fine plants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>I was pleased with this, because it was natural to E., and because we have enough who profess to see nothing but the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>It was wholesome to have the other side also presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Yet the lecture, as a whole, gave me limited satisfaction and taught me nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>E. dwells so habitually <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> in a world of his own that when he comes down into the real and practical (everything being strange to him), he notices <hi rend="italics">minutia</hi> that would escape the habituated vision, and his remarks accordingly have wonderful freshness and point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>But in going to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, which was as unfamiliar to the eyes of other travellers as to his own, he has reported things which we had already heard many times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>I heard the lecture at our Cambridge Lyceum, and, as his diction was somewhat peculiar, I was much amused by watching the audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> worthy joiner repeatedly and vigorously scratching the outside of his head in the hope of exciting a corresponding vivacity within &mdash; but he at last gave it up as useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>A new edition of E.'s works is to appear with a portrait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>C. [Cheney] is to draw it, which I am sorry for. His heads are always graceful and spiritual, but they are wanting in that punctilious veracity which gives to a portrait its whole worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>Yet he gives the <hi rend="italics">expression</hi> of the person quite wonderfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>I went to his room once, some half a dozen years ago, and saw, among other heads, <num value="1">one</num> of a little <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> boy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>It turned out to be a son (whom I had never seen,) of a cousin of mine.</p>
