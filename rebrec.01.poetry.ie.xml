<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>the other morning, at the breakfast table, when I, an unobserved spectator, happened to be present, <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00027" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> was observed to gaze frequently at his right hand and brush it with his left in a hurried and nervous manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He did this so often that it excited attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>At length <num value="1">one</num> of the persons comprising the breakfast party &mdash; his name, I think, is <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00028" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, and he is a member of Congress from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>--took upon himself to ask the occasion of <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00029" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>'s disquietude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>it is nothing but a dream I had last night, and which makes me see perpetually a large black spot, like an ink blotch, upon the back of my right hand; an optical illusion, I suppose.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Of course these words excited the curiosity of the company, but no <num value="1">one</num> ventured to beg the details of this singular dream, until <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00032" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName> asked quietly, <quote>What was your dream like?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>I am not very superstitious about dreams; but sometimes they have a great deal of truth in them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><quote>But this was such a peculiarly absurd dream,</quote> said <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00033" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, again brushing the back of his right hand; <quote>however, if it does not intrude too much on the time of our friends, I will relate it to you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Of course the company were profuse in their expressions of anxiety to know all about the dream, and <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00034" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> related it. <quote>At a late hour last night, as I was sitting in my room, engaged in writing, I was astonished by the entrance of a visitor who, without a word, took a seat opposite me at my table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>This surprised me, as I had given particular orders to the servant that I should on no account be disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The manner in which the intruder entered, so perfectly self-possessed, taking his seat opposite me without a word, as though my room and all within it belonged to him, excited in me as much surprise as indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>As I raised my head to look into his features, over the top of my shaded lamp, I discovered that he was wrapped in a thin cloak, which effectually concealed his face and features from my view; and as I raised my head, he spoke: <q direct="unspecified">What are you writing, senator from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I did not think of his impertinence at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but answered him voluntarily, <q direct="unspecified">I am writing a plan for the dissolution of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>(You know, gentlemen, that I am expected to produce a plan of dissolution in the event of certain contingencies.) To this the intruder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>replied, in the coolest manner possible, <q direct="unspecified">Senator from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, will you allow me to look at your hand, your right hand?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He rose, the cloak fell, and I beheld his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Gentlemen, the sight of that face struck me like a thunder-clap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It was the face of a dead man, whom extraordinary events had called back to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The features were those of <persName n="Washington,General,George,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00035" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He was dressed in the <name>Revolutionary</name> costume, such as you see in the <orgName n="Patent Office" type="office">Patent Office</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>His agitation, <quote>I need not tell you, was shared by the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Toombs at length broke the embarrassing pause.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Well, what was the issue of this scene?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/><persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00037" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> resumed. <quote>The intruder, as I have said, rose and asked to look at my right hand, as though I had not the power to refuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>I extended it. The truth is, I felt a strange thrill pervade me at his touch; he grasped it and held it near the light, thus affording full time to examine every feature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It was the face of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>After holding my hand for a moment, he looked at me steadily, and said in a quiet way, <q direct="unspecified">And with this right hand, senator from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, you would sign your name to a paper declaring the <rs>Union</rs> dissolved</q> I answered in the affirmative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/><q direct="unspecified">Yes,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">if a certain contingency arises, I will sign my name to the <name>Declaration</name> of Dissolution.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>But at that moment a black blotch appeared on the back of my hand, which I seem to see now. <q direct="unspecified">What is that?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>said I, alarmed, I know not why, at the blotch on my hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><q direct="unspecified">That,</q> said he, dropping my hand, <q direct="unspecified">is the mark by which <persName n="Arnold,,Benedict,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00038" reg="default:Arnold,Benedict,,,"><foreName>Benedict</foreName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName> is known in the next world.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>He said no more, gentlemen, but drew from beneath his cloak an object which he laid upon the table &mdash; laid upon the very paper on which I was writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>This object, gentlemen, was a skeleton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/><q direct="unspecified">There,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">there are the bones of <persName n="Hayne,,Isaac,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00039" reg="default:Hayne,Isaac,,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <surname>Hayne</surname></persName>, who was hung at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 4" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> by the <rs>British</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>He gave his life in order to establish the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>When you put your name to a Declaration of Dissolution, why, you may as well have the bones of <persName n="Hayne,,Isaac,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00040" reg="default:Hayne,Isaac,,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <surname>Hayne</surname></persName> before you &mdash; he was a <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> and so are you. But there was no blotch on his right hand.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>With these words the intruder left the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>I started back from the contact with the dead man's bones and &mdash; awoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Overcome by labor, I had fallen asleep, and had been dreaming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Was it not a singular dream?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>All the company answered in the affirmative, and <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00041" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName> muttered, <quote>Singular, very singular,</quote> and at the same time looking curiously at the back of his right hand, while <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0084.0015.00007.00042" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> placed his head between his hands and seemed buried in thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>As the <hi rend="italics">Post's</hi> paragraph will be copied, with amplifications, into Republican papers throughout the country, it may be well to state the real facts upon which the above ridiculous report is probably based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Several weeks ago, <measure n="500cases" type="mass">five hundred cases</measure> of muskets were shipped to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, to supply, it is said, the legal demand of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> for her quota of guns from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>There was no mystery about the transaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The arms came down the <placeName reg="Hudson, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,1124727">Hudson River</placeName> on a barge, and were taken on board the <rs>Savannah</rs> steamer like any other cargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>If this shipment had occurred at any other time, it would have caused no remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Its occurrence now is explained by the fact, that <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> had previously neglected to draw out the quota of arms to which she was entitled, and which the <rs>General Government</rs> could not legally or equitably deny to her</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The muskets are worth about <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">$11</measure> <num value="50">50</num> each, so that the <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> would cost <measure n="115000dollars" type="currency">$115,000</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Divide <measure n="200000dollars" type="currency">$200,000</measure> by <num value="30">thirty</num>, and we have for her distributive share <measure n="6666dollars" type="currency">$6,666</measure>; so that the <num value="10000">10,000</num> muskets would be her quota for <hi rend="italics"><measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure></hi> and more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>What is martial law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Few there are who understand the full significance of this term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>At this time, a correct understanding of its meaning is unusually important.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Martial law is defined by Bouvier, as <quote>a code established for the government of the army and navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</quote> whose principal rules are to be found in the articles of war, prescribed by act of Congress.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Martial law is generally and vaguely held to be, a suspension of all ordinary civil rights and process &mdash; and, as such, approximates closely to a military despotism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>It is an arbitrary law, originating in emergencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>In times of extreme peril to the <rs>State</rs>, either from without or from within, the public welfare demands extraordinary measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>And martial law being proclaimed, signifies that the operation of the ordinary legal delays of justice are suspended by the military power, which has for the time become supreme.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>It suspends the operation of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus;</hi> enables persons charged with treason to be summarily tried by court-martial, instead of grand jury; justifies searches and seizures of private property, and the taking possession of public high-ways and other means of communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Involving the highest exercise of sovereignty, it is of course, capable of great abuse; and it is only to be justified in emergencies of the most imperative and perilous nature such as now appear to exist in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>It is very well understood that he had a plan for introducing reinforcements, which had been submitted to members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, and was regarded as measurably practicable, but attended with the probability if not certainty of collision, which constituted the chief objection to its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>His scheme did not contemplate any serious danger in running the gauntlet of the batteries on the islands which guard the channels, but only in landing the men and provisions at <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, after it had been reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>If a fire was opened upon his transports from <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> or the other batteries, it would be necessary for <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> to silence them in order to discharge the reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Any attempt; therefore, looking to that object would almost inevitably lead to bloodshed, and before resorting to it, the <name>Administration</name> would be constrained to expect that alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Even if successful without great loss of life, nothing would be gained but the retention of a fortress which has only a local value in protecting <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 4" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, and is of no national moment whatever.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>Why this war upon Chlorides, Nitrates, Muriatic and Nitric Acids?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>What is there about the <name>Chloride</name> of Potassium to make it a contraband of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>Its principal use is in the manufacture of Alum; and the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops cannot have much use for that, unless the <rs>Union</rs> forces intend to <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>set the <name>Secessionists</name> on fire, and prohibit the use of Alum in order to prevent the <name>Southerners</name> from making their clothes and bodies fire-proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>I can understand the objection to Chlorate of Potash, because that makes a terribly explosive compound, being the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Agent">chief agent</rs> in the manufacture of percussion powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>But it is a dangerous article to handle, and why not let the <name>Southerners</name> have it, and blow themselves sky-high with it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>But the prohibition in this particular amounts to nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>The Muriatic Acid is prohibited in order to prevent the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> from manufacturing Chlorine gas, by which Chlorates and Chlorides are made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>Muriatic Acid is not only not essential to the manufacture of Chlorine, but it is not used at all in making that article on a large scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>It is easily made with manganese, table salt, and unconcentrated sulphuric acid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>This produces Chlorine, and neither of these articles is prohibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>The manufacture of Chlorine from the <name>Binoxide</name> of Manganese and Muriatic Acid is so perilous, owing to the action of the acid on the lead, and the evolution of Hydrogen gas, by which a spontaneous explosive mixture of Chlorine is produced, that the attention of the <rs>Secretary</rs> is respectfully asked as to the utility of preventing the seceding States from blowing themselves up. Why prohibit them from using the dangerous articles, and allow them free access to means unattended with any peril?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>And why prohibit Potash, when it can easily be manufactured wherever wood can be obtained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>The small quantity of Chlorine and of Potash needed for war purposes, can be obtained without the use of the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s interdicted articles, and might be dispensed, as the authorities of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> sold whiskey some years since &mdash; for medicinal purposes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>The prohibition against Nitric Acid and its compounds can answer no very useful purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>The circular explains that Nitric Acid is prohibited because it can be used in the manufacture of gun-cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>Why should the <rs>Secretary</rs> discourage the manufacture of this article?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>Its use is attended with a good deal of peril to those who handle it. For war purposes it cannot be compared with gunpowder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>It is much less tractable, very perilous in itself, and terrible on weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>It has much more force than gunpowder, and does not make smoke, but it has disadvantages that counterbalance all these qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>It may ignite from percussion, or even spontaneously, or it may be decomposed by the moisture of the atmosphere, or even spontaneously, and thus become worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>Its explosive force is subject to great variations, and the great danger attending its manufacture has caused the almost universal abandonment of attempts at making the article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>The velocity of its combustion is too great for all fire-arms, except those of unusual strength and the smallest bore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>If it gives out no smoke, it gives out something more deleterious &mdash; acid fumes, which destroy health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>Then, again, cotton is a fibrous body, and the physical conditions of a fibrous body are strongly opposed to its use in fire-arms.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>When prepared by the <rs>American</rs> method, by treating Schonbein's gun-cotton with a saturated solution of Chlorate of Potash, it acquires a remarkable force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>But the <rs>British</rs> <orgName n="Ordnance Board" type="board">Board of Ordnance</orgName> have decided against the adoption of this explosive article for fire-arms, for reasons already given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>If it exploded as instantaneously as fulminating mercury, or those terrible explosives, chloride of nitrogen or iodine, it would be useless for its present applications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>It would go the wrong way.

Yet the stick was not <hi rend="italics">lifted</hi> by the explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>The merit of gunpowder is, that it lifts and projects the materials in front of it, and thus acquires its force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>Instantaneous as the effects seem to be, the explosive force <quote>does not reach its intensity until the space it occupies has been enlarged by that through which the ball has been propelled during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment of ignition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/>It is told on good authority, and is, doubtless, substantially correct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>It is well known that there are several small models of ships in the <rs>Marshal</rs>'s office, which have been ornamented with little secession flags about half the size of <num value="1">one</num>'s hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>They are made of paper, and colored with <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> ink. <num value="1">One</num> at the masthead of the largest ship bears the name of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0084.0419.00109.01100" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and the others are the ordinary <num value="3">three</num>-striped rag, recently adopted as the ensigns of the <rs>Southern Slave Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>On account of the display of these flags, the only public place in the city, we believe, the <rs>Marshal</rs>'s office is a sort of privileged quarters for Secessionists, and nothing is more common than to hear secession talk there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>This has been particularly the case since the news of the breaking out of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>The story goes, that while several gentlemen were sitting in the <rs>Marshal</rs>'s office, attending to business, a big strapping fellow, all the way from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, with a revolver peeping out from under his coat-tail, strode into the place, with the air of a Tarquin, and exclaimed: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>We'll skin 'em out of their boots.</p></quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>The braggart had scarcely finished his tirade, when <num value="1">one</num> of the gentlemen, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>----, of the ship----, who was observed to be getting nervous, suddenly jumped up, and taking his place in front of the fellow, and shaking his fists, replied: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>Now, sir, I don't know you, and don't want to know you; but I suppose you designate me as <num value="1">one</num> of those nutmeg-selling, mackerel-catching, cod-livered <name>Yankee</name> sons of----.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>The boaster, seeing the captain's determined bearing, and finding that he was in downright earnest, replied by saying that his remarks were general in their nature, and not by any means intended to apply to any particular person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>Nothing was further from his purpose than to insult any person present, and particularly a stranger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>To this the irate captain retorted: <quote>The language, sir, is an insult to the <rs>American</rs> name, and I for <num value="1">one</num> will not stand it from any living man.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>We are not <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in the field, and we do not intend to be so on paper; but there are a few plain principles and facts which any mind may understand, without having fought battles or won victories.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>In the first place, delay is against us in the matter of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>The policy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, it seems to us, was and is, not to wait until vast masses are aggregated upon us, but to act promptly with such troops as we possess, and to demoralize and prevent the discipline of the troops of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by vanquishing them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>For, in the second place, our raw troops are far superior to the raw troops of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>Our people are used to arms.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>And in the third place, no soldiers, especially undisciplined soldiers, as the greater part of all the soldiers now in the field must be, can stand the eternal agitations of apprehended attacks in a defensive warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>To be called out continually to prepare for battle, and yet not to fight, will chill the hearts of the bravest troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>And still further, instead of having <num value="1">one</num> point for anxiety, attention and alarm are exacted to half a dozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>Troops, at a heavy expense, are scattered about for the protection of different points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>This is the necessary incident of a defensive policy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>But, more than all, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> ought not to allow <num value="1">one</num> foot of Southern soil to be the battle-field between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the <rs>Union</rs>.
