<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/></p> 
<p> I was between <num value="3">three</num> and <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of age when our mother died, and my personal recollections of her are therefore but few. But the deep interest and veneration that she inspired in all who knew her were such that during all my childhood I was constantly hearing her spoken of, and from <num value="1">one</num> friend or another some incident or anecdote of her life was constantly being impressed upon me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Mother was <num value="1">one</num> of those strong, restful, yet widely sympathetic natures in whom all around seemed to find comfort and repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The communion between her and my father was a peculiar <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It was an intimacy throughout the whole range of their being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There was no human mind in whose decisions he had greater confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Both intellectually and morally he regarded her as the better and stronger portion of himself, and I remember hearing him say that after her death his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sensation was a sort of terror, like that of a child suddenly shut out alone in the dark.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In my own childhood only <num value="2">two</num> incidents of my mother twinkle like rays through the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><num value="1">One</num> was of our all running and dancing out before her <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> from the nursery to the sitting-room <num value="1">one</num> Sabbath morning, and her pleasant voice saying after us, <quote> Remember the <name>Sabbath</name> day to keep it holy, children.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Another remembrance is this: mother was an enthusiastic horticulturist in all the small ways that limited means allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Her <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName> in New York had just sent her a small parcel of fine tulip-bulbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I remember rummaging these out of an obscure corner of the nursery <num value="1">one</num> day when she was gone out, and being strongly seized with the idea that they were good to eat, using all the little <rs>English</rs> I then possessed to persuade my brothers that these were onions such as grown people ate and would be very nice for us. So we fell to and devoured the whole, and I recollect being somewhat disappointed in the odd sweetish taste, and thinking that onions were not so nice as I had supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Then mother's serene face appeared at the nursery door and we all ran towards her, telling with <num value="1">one</num> voice of our discovery and achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We had found a bag of onions and had eaten them all up.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Also I remember that there was not even a momentary expression of impatience, but that she sat down and said, <quote>My dear children, what you have done makes mamma very sorry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Those were not onions but roots of beautiful flowers, and if you had let them alone we should have next summer in the garden great beautiful red and yellow flowers such as you never saw.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I remember how drooping and dispirited we all grew at this picture, and how sadly we regarded the empty paper bag.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Then I have a recollection of her reading aloud to the children <rs>Miss Edgeworth</rs>'s <quote> <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName>,</quote> which had just <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> come out, I believe, and was exciting a good deal of attention among the educational circles of <persName n="Litchfield,,,,," id="n0181.0003.00004.00037" reg="mostcommon:Litchfield,nomatch:0"><surname>Litchfield</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>After that came a time when every <num value="1">one</num> said she was sick, and I used to be permitted to go once a day into her room, where she sat bolstered up in bed. I have a vision of a very fair face with a bright red spot on each cheek and her quiet smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I remember dreaming <num value="1">one</num> night that mamma had got well, and of waking with loud transports of joy that were hushed down by some <num value="1">one</num> who came into the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>My dream was indeed a true <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>She was forever well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Then came the funeral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName> was too little to go. I can see his golden curls and little black frock as he frolicked in the sun like a kitten, full of ignorant joy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> I recollect the mourning dresses, the tears of the older children, the walking to the burial-ground, and somebody's speaking at the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Then all was closed, and we little ones, to whom it was so confused, asked where she was gone and would she never come back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> They told us at <num value="1">one</num> time that she had been laid in the ground, and at another that she had gone to heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Thereupon <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName>, putting the <num value="2">two</num> things together, resolved to dig through the ground and go to heaven to find her; for being discovered under <persName><roleName n="Sister">sister</roleName> <foreName>Catherine</foreName></persName>'s window <num value="1">one</num> morning digging with great zeal and earnestness, she called to him to know what he was doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Lifting his curly head, he answered with great simplicity, <quote> Why, I'm going to heaven to find mamma.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Although our mother's bodily presence thus disappeared from our circle, I think her memory and example had more influence in moulding her family, in deterring <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> from evil and exciting to good, than the living presence of many mothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I was placed in the arms of an old lady, who held me close and wept silently, a thing at which I marveled, for my great loss was already faded from my childish mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> I remember being put to bed by my aunt in a large room, on <num value="1">one</num> side of which stood the bed appropriated to her and me, and on the other that of my grandmother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>My <persName><roleName n="Aunt">aunt</roleName> <foreName>Harriet</foreName></persName> was no common character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>A more energetic human being never undertook the education of a child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Her ideas of education were those of a vigorous <name>English</name> woman of the <orgName n="Old School" type="school">old school</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>She believed in the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, and had she been born under that <hi rend="italics">regime</hi> would have believed in the king stoutly, although being of the generation following the <name>Revolution</name> she was a not less stanch supporter of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> According to her views little girls were to be taught to move very gently, to speak softly and prettily, to say <quote>yes ma'am,</quote> and <quote> no ma'am,</quote> never to tear their clothes, to sew, to knit at regular hours, to go to church on Sunday and make all the responses, and to come home and be catechised.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> During these catechisings she used to place my little <persName><roleName n="Cousin">cousin</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> and myself bolt upright at her knee, while black Dinah and <persName><foreName>Harry</foreName></persName>, the bound boy, were ranged at a respectful distance behind us; for <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Harriet</foreName></persName> always impressed it upon her servants <quote> to order themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters,</quote> a portion of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> catechism that always pleased me, particularly when applied to them, as it insured <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> their calling me <quote><persName><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Harriet</foreName></persName>,</quote> and treating me with a degree of consideration such as I never enjoyed in the more democratic circle at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I became proficient in the <rs type="place">Church</rs> catechism, and gave my aunt great satisfaction by the old-fashioned gravity and steadiness with which I learned to repeat it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>As my father was a Congregational minister, I believe <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Harriet</foreName></persName>, though the highest of <orgName n="High Church" type="church">High Church</orgName> women, felt some scruples as to whether it was desirable that my religious education should be entirely out of the sphere of my birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Therefore when this catechetical exercise was finished she would say, <quote>Now, niece, you have to learn another catechism, because your father is a Presbyterian minister,</quote> --and then she would endeavor to make me commit to memory the <name>Assembly</name> catechism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>At this lengthening of exercise I secretly murmured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>I was rather pleased at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question in the <rs type="place">Church</rs> catechism, which is certainly quite on the level of any child's understanding,--<quote> What is your name?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It was such an easy good start, I could say it so loud and clear, and I was accustomed to compare it with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question in the <name>Primer</name>, <quote>What is the chief end of man?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>as vastly more difficult for me to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>In fact, between my aunt's secret unbelief and my own childish impatience of too much catechism, the matter was indefinitely postponed after a few ineffectual attempts, and I was overjoyed to hear her announce privately to grandmother that she thought it would be time enough for <persName><foreName>Harriet</foreName></persName> to learn the <rs>Presbyterian</rs> catechism when she went home.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Among the <name>Evangelists</name> especially was the old lady perfectly at home, and her idea of each of the apostles was so distinct and dramatic that she spoke of them as of familiar acquaintances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Before them all our compositions were read aloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>When mine was read I noticed that father, who was sitting on high by <persName n="Brace,Mister,,,," id="n0181.0003.00014.00072" reg="nearbymention:Brace,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brace</surname></persName>, brightened and looked interested, and at the close I heard him ask, <quote> Who wrote that composition?</quote>

<text><body> 
<head>Can the immortality of the soul be proved by the light of nature?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>It has justly been concluded by the philosophers of every age that <quote>The proper study of mankind is man,</quote> and his nature and composition, both physical and mental, have been subjects of the most critical examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>In the course of these researches many have been at a loss to account for the change which takes place in the body at the time of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>By some it has been attributed to the flight of its tenant, and by others to its final annihilation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The questions, <quote>What becomes of the soul at the time of death?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>and, if it be not annihilated, <quote>What is its destiny after death?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>are those which, from the interest that we all feel in them, will probably engross universal attention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>In pursuing these inquiries it will be necessary to divest ourselves of all that knowledge which we have obtained from the light which revelation has shed over them, and place ourselves in the same position as the philosophers of past ages when considering the same subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> argument which has been advanced to prove the immortality of the soul is drawn from the <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> nature of the mind itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>It has (say the supporters of this theory) no composition of parts, and therefore, as there are no particles, is not susceptible of divisibility and cannot be acted upon by decay, and therefore if it will not decay it will exist forever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Now because the mind is not susceptible of decay effected in the ordinary way by a gradual separation of particles, affords no proof that that same omnipotent power which created it cannot by another simple exertion of power again reduce it to nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The only reason for belief which this argument affords is that the soul cannot be acted upon by decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>But it does not prove that it cannot destroy its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Therefore, for the validity of this argument, it must either be proved that the <quote>Creator</quote> has not the power to destroy it, or that he has not the will; but as neither of these can be established, our immortality is left dependent on the pleasure of the <name>Creator</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>But it is said that it is evident that the <name>Creator</name> designed the soul for immortality, or he would never have created it so essentially different from the body, for had they both been designed for the same end they would both have been created alike, as there would have been no object in forming them otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>This only proves that the soul and body had not the same destinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Now of what these destinations are we know nothing, and after much useless reasoning we return where we began, our argument depending upon the good pleasure of the <name>Creator</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>And here it is said that a being of such infinite wisdom and benevolence as that of which the <name>Creator</name> is possessed would not have formed man with such vast <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> capacities and boundless desires, and would have given him no opportunity for exercising them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>In order to establish the validity of this argument it is necessary to prove by the light of Nature that the <name>Creator</name> <hi rend="italics">is</hi> benevolent, which, being impracticable, is of itself sufficient to render the argument invalid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>But the argument proceeds upon the supposition that to destroy the soul would be unwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Now this is arraigning the <quote>All-wise</quote> before the tribunal of his subjects to answer for the mistakes in his government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Can we look into the council of the <quote>Unsearchable</quote> and see what means are made to answer their ends?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>We do not know but the destruction of the soul may, in the government of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, be made to answer such a purpose that its existence would be contrary to the dictates of wisdom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The great desire of the soul for immortality, its secret, innate horror of annihilation, has been brought to prove its immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>But do we always find this horror or this desire?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Is it not much more evident that the great majority of mankind have no such dread at all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>True that there is a strong feeling of horror excited by the idea of perishing from the earth and being forgotten, of losing all those honors and all that fame awaited them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Many feel this secret horror when they look down upon the vale of futurity and reflect that though now the idols of the world, soon all which will be left them will be the common portion of mankindoblivion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>But this dread does not arise from any idea of their destiny beyond the tomb, and even were this true, it would afford no proof that the mind would exist forever, merely from its strong desires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>For it <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> might with as much correctness be argued that the body will exist forever because we have a great dread of dying, and upon this principle nothing which we strongly desire would ever be withheld from us, and no evil that we greatly dread will ever come upon us, a principle evidently false.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Again, it has been said that the constant progression of the powers of the mind affords another proof of its immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Concerning this, <persName n="Addison,,,,," id="n0181.0003.00018.00073" reg="mostcommon:Addison,nomatch:0"><surname>Addison</surname></persName> remarks, <quote>Were a human soul ever thus at a stand in her acquirements, were her faculties to be full blown and incapable of further enlargement, I could imagine that she might fall away insensibly and drop at once into a state of annihilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>But can we believe a thinking being that is in a perpetual progress of improvement, and traveling on from perfection to perfection after having just looked abroad into the works of her Creator and made a few discoveries of his infinite wisdom and goodness, must perish at her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> setting out and in the very beginning of her inquiries?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>In answer to this it may be said that the soul is not always progressing in her powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Is it not rather a subject of general remark that those brilliant talents which in youth expand, in manhood become stationary, and in old age gradually sink to decay?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Till when the ancient man descends to the tomb scarce a wreck of that once powerful mind remains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Who, but upon reading the history of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, does not look with awe upon the effects produced by the talents of her <persName><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Who but admires that undaunted firmness in time of peace and that profound depth of policy which she displayed in the cabinet?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/><pb id="p.19" n="19"/> Yet behold the tragical end of this learned, this politic princess!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Behold the triumphs of age and sickness over her once powerful talents, and say not that the faculties of man are always progressing in their powers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>From the activity of the mind at the hour of death has also been deduced its immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>But it is not true that the mind is always active at the time of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>We find recorded in history numberless instances of those talents, which were once adequate to the government of a nation, being so weakened and palsied by the touch of sickness as scarcely to tell to beholders what they once were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The talents of the statesman, the wisdom of the sage, the courage and might of the warrior, are instantly destroyed by it, and all that remains of them is the waste of idiocy or the madness of insanity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Some minds there are who at the time of death retain their faculties though much impaired, and if the argument be valid these are the only cases where immortality is conferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Again, it is urged that the inequality of rewards and punishments in this world demand another in which virtue may be rewarded and vice punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>This argument, in the first place, takes for its foundation that by the light of nature the distinction between virtue and vice can be discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>By some this is absolutely disbelieved, and by all considered as extremely doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>And, secondly, it puts the <name>Creator</name> under an obligation to reward and punish the actions of his creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>No such obligation exists, and therefore the argument cannot be valid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>And this supposes the <name>Creator</name> to be a being of justice, which cannot by the light of nature be proved, and as the whole <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> argument rests upon this foundation it certainly cannot be correct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>This argument also directly impeaches the wisdom of the <name>Creator</name>, for the sense of it is this,--that, forasmuch as he was not able to manage his government in this world, he must have another in which to rectify the mistakes and oversights of this, and what an idea would this give us of our All-wise Creator?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It is also said that all nations have some conceptions of a future state, that the ancient <rs>Greeks</rs> and <rs>Romans</rs> believed in it, that no nation has been found but have possessed some idea of a future state of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>But their belief arose more from the fact that they wished it to be so than from any real ground of belief; for arguments appear much more plausible when the mind wishes to be convinced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>But it is said that every nation, however circumstanced, possess some idea of a future state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>For this we may account by the fact that it was handed down by tradition from the time of the flood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>From all these arguments, which, however plausible at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight, are found to be futile, may be argued the necessity of a revelation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Without it, the destiny of the noblest of the works of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would have been left in obscurity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Never till the blessed light of the <name>Gospel</name> dawned on the borders of the pit, and the heralds of the <name>Cross</name> proclaimed <quote>Peace on earth and good will to men,</quote> was it that bewildered and misled man was enabled to trace his celestial origin and glorious destiny.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The sun of the <name>Gospel</name> has dispelled the darkness that has rested on objects beyond the tomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>In the <name>Gospel</name> man learned that when the dust returned to <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> dust the spirit fled to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who gave it. He there found that though man has lost the image of his divine Creator, he is still destined, after this earthly house of his tabernacle is dissolved, to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, to a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p></body></text> </p>

<p>Many of my objections you did remove that afternoon we spent together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>After that I was not as unhappy as I had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>I felt, nevertheless, that my views were very indistinct and contradictory, and feared that if you left me thus I might return to the same dark, desolate state in which I had been all summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>I felt that my immortal interest, my happiness for both worlds, was depending on the turn my feelings might take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>In my disappointment and distress I called upon <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and it seemed as if I was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>I felt that He could supply the loss of all earthly love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>I felt as if restored, nevermore to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Such sober certainty of waking bliss had long been a stranger to me.

I cannot say exactly what it is makes me reluctant to speak of my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>It costs me an effort to express feeling of any kind, but more particularly to speak of my private religious feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> questions me, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse is to conceal all I can. As for expression of affection towards my brothers and sisters, my companions or friends, the stronger the affection the less inclination have I to express it. Yet sometimes I think myself the most frank, open, and communicative of beings, and at other times the most reserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>If you can resolve all these caprices into general principles, you will do more than I can. Your speaking so much philosophically has a tendency to repress confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, it seems to be taking from the majesty and dignity of the divine character to suppose that his happiness can be at all affected by the conduct of his sinful, erring creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>This I shall send to you, as some of the gentlemen, it seems, took a fancy to it and requested leave to put it in the <quote> Western Magazine,</quote> and so it is in print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>It is ascribed to <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Catherine</foreName></persName></hi>, or I don't know that I should have let it go. I have no notion of appearing in <hi rend="italics">propria persons</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> The next piece was a satire on certain members who were getting very much into the way of joking on the worn-out subjects of matrimony and old maid and old bachelorism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>I therefore wrote a set of legislative enactments purporting to be from the ladies of <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> the society, forbidding all such allusions in future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>It made some sport at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>I try not to be personal, and to be courteous, even in satire.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>But I have written a piece this week that is making me some disquiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>I did not like it that there was so little that was serious and rational about the reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>So I conceived the design of writing a <hi rend="italics">set of letters</hi>, and throwing them in, as being the letters of a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>I wrote a letter this week for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the set, easy, not very sprightly,--describing an imaginary situation, a house in the country, a gentleman and lady, <persName n="Howard,Mister,,,," id="n0181.0005.00070.00256" reg="mostcommon:Howard,Annie,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName><surname n="Howard"></surname></persName> and <persName n="Howard,Mrs.,,,," id="n0181.0005.00070.00257" reg="mostcommon:Howard,Annie,,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, as being pious, literary, and agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>I threw into the letter a number of little particulars and incidental allusions to give it the air of having been really a letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>I meant thus to give myself an opportunity for the introduction of different subjects and the discussion of different characters in future letters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/> I meant to write on a great number of subjects in future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/><persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Elisabeth</foreName></persName>, only, was in the secret; <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Elliot,,Sarah,,," id="n0181.0005.00070.00258" reg="default:Elliot,Sarah,,,"><foreName>Sarah</foreName> <surname>Elliot</surname></persName> were not to know.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/> Yesterday morning I finished my letter, smoked it to make it look yellow, tore it to make it look old, directed it and scratched out the direction, postmarked it with red ink, sealed it and broke the seal, all this to give credibility to the fact of its being a real letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Then I inclosed it in an envelope, stating that it was a part of a <hi rend="italics">set</hi> which had incidentally fallen into my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>This envelope was written in a scrawny, scrawly, gentleman's hand.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> examined it and pronounced, <hi rend="italics">ex cathedra</hi>, that it must have been a real letter.

<p>We mean to turn over the <rs>West</rs> by means of <hi rend="italics">model schools</hi> in this, its capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>This is especially true with regard to boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>To govern boys by moral influences requires tact and talent and versatility; it requires also the same division of labor that female education does.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>But men of tact, versatility, talent, and piety will not devote their lives to teaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>They must be ministers and missionaries, and all that, and while there is such a thrilling call for action in this way, every man who is merely teaching feels as if he were a Hercules with a distaff, ready to spring to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> trumpet that calls him away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>As for division of labor, men must have salaries that can support wife and family, and, of course, a revenue would be required to support a requisite number of teachers if they could be found.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Then, if men have more knowledge they have less <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> talent at communicating it, nor have they the patience, the long-suffering, and gentleness necessary to superintend the formation of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>We intend to make these principles understood, and ourselves to set the example of what females can do in this way. You see that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate talent is necessary for all that we mean to do, especially for the last, because here we must face down the prejudices of society and we must have exemplary success to be believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>For some few weeks past I have received your paper through the mail, and have read it with great interest, and desire to return my acknowledgments for it. It will be a pleasure to me at some time when less occupied to contribute something to its columns.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>In the first place you say the church is <quote>proslavery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>There is a sense in which this may be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>The <orgName n="American Church" type="church">American church</orgName> of all denominations, taken as a body, comprises the best and most conscientious peopie <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>I do not say it comprises none but these, or that none such are found out of it, but only if a census were taken of the purest and most high principled men and women of the country, the majority of them would be found to be professors of religion in some of the various <name>Christian</name> denominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>This fact has given to the church great weight in this country &mdash; the general and predominant spirit of intelligence and probity and piety of its majority has given it that degree of weight that it has the power to decide the great moral questions of the day. Whatever it unitedly and decidedly sets itself against as moral evil it can put down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>In this sense the church is responsible for the sin of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/><persName n="Barnes,Doctor,,,," id="n0181.0009.00151.00578" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName> has beautifully and briefly expressed this on the last page of his work on slavery, when he says: <quote>Not all the force out of the church could sustain slavery an hour if it were not sustained in it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>It then appears that the church has the power to put an end to this evil and does not do it. In this sense she may be said to be pro-slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>But the church has the same power over intemperance, and Sabbath-breaking, and sin of all kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>There is not a doubt that if the moral power of the church were brought up to the New Testament standpoint it is sufficient to put an end to all these as well as to slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>But I would ask you, Would you consider it a fair representation of the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName> in this country to say that it is pro-intemperance, pro-Sabbath-breaking, and pro everything that it might put down if it were in a higher state of moral feeling?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>If you should make a list of all the abolitionists of the country, I think that you would find a majority of <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> them in the church &mdash; certainly some of the most influential and efficient ones are ministers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>I am a minister's daughter, and a minister's wife, and I have had <num value="6">six</num> brothers in the ministry (<num value="1">one</num> is in heaven); I certainly ought to know something of the feelings of ministers on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>I remember his preaching drawing tears down the hardest faces of the old farmers in his congregation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>I well remember his prayers morning and evening in the family for <quote>poor, oppressed, bleeding <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>,</quote> that the time of her deliverance might come; prayers offered with strong crying and tears, and which indelibly impressed my heart and made me what I am from my very soul, the enemy of all slavery.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>After all, my brother, the strength and hope of your oppressed race does lie in the church &mdash; in hearts united to Him of whom it is said, <quote>He shall spare the souls of the needy, and precious shall their blood be in his sight.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>The light will spread in churches, the tone of feeling will rise, Christians <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> will give up all connection with, and take up their testimony against, slavery, and thus the work will be done.</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>My <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>,--It is not with the common pleasure of gratified authorship that I say how much I am gratified by the receipt of your very kind communication with regard to my humble efforts in the cause of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>The subject is <num value="1">one</num> so grave, so awful &mdash; the success of what I have written has been so singular and so unexpected &mdash; that I can scarce retain a self-consciousness <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> and am constrained to look upon it all as the work of a Higher Power, who, when He pleases, can accomplish his results by the feeblest instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>I am glad of anything which gives notoriety to the book, because it is a plea for the dumb and the helpless!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>I am glad particularly of notoriety in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> because I see with what daily increasing power <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s opinion is to act on this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can tell but a <hi rend="italics">native</hi> born here by what an infinite complexity of ties, nerves, and ligaments this terrible evil is bound in <num value="1">one</num> body politic; how the slightest touch upon it causes even the free States to thrill and shiver, what a terribly corrupting and tempting power it has upon the conscience and moral sentiment even of a free community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>Nobody can tell the <num value="1000">thousand</num> ways in which by trade, by family affinity, or by political expediency, the free part of our country is constantly tempted to complicity with the slaveholding part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>It is a terrible thing to become used to hearing the enormities of slavery, to hear of things day after day that <num value="1">one</num> would think the sun should hide his face from, and yet, to <hi rend="italics">get used to them</hi>, to discusss them coolly, to dismiss them coolly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>For example, the sale of intelligent, handsome colored females for vile purposes, facts of the most public nature, have made this a perfectly understood matter in our Northern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>I have now, myself, under charge and educating, <num value="2">two</num> girls of whose character any mother might be proud, who have actually been rescued from this sale in the <placeName key="tgn,7014214" n="1.000 1068" reg="new orleans, orleans, louisiana">New Orleans</placeName> market.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>I desire to inclose a tract<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/> 
<p>Afterwards embodied in the <hi rend="italics">Key to <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s Cabin</hi>.</p></note> in which I sketched down a few incidents in the history of the family to which <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> these girls belong; it will show more than words can the kind of incident to which I allude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>The tract is not a published document, only <hi rend="italics">printed</hi> to assist me in raising money, and it would not, at present, be for the good of the parties to have it published even in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>But though these things are known in the free States, and other things, if possible, worse, yet there is a terrible deadness of moral sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>They are known by clergymen who yet would not on any account so far commit themselves as to preach on the evils of slavery, or pray for the slaves in their pulpits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>They are known by politicians who yet give their votes for slavery extension and perpetuation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>This year both our great leading parties voted to suppress all agitation of the subject, and in both those parties were men who knew personally facts of slavery and the internal slave-trade that <num value="1">one</num> would think no man could ever forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>Men <hi rend="italics">united</hi> in pledging themselves to the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>, who yet would tell you in private conversation that it was an abomination, and who do not hesitate to say, that as a matter of practice they always help the fugitive because they <hi rend="italics">can't</hi> do otherwise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>The moral effect of this constant insincerity, the moral effect of witnessing and becoming accustomed to the most appalling forms of crime and oppression, is to me the most awful and distressing part of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>Nothing makes me feel it so painfully as to see with how much more keenness the <rs>English</rs> feel the disclosures of my book than the <rs>Americans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>I myself am blunted by use &mdash; by seeing, touching, handling the <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>In dealing even for the ransom of slaves, in learning market prices of men, women, and children, I feel that I acquire a horrible familiarity with evil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>Here, then, the great, wise, and powerful mind of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, if she will but fully master the subject, may greatly help us. Hers is the same kind of mind as our our own, but disembarrassed from our temptations and unnerved by the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of influences that blind and deaden us. There is a healthful vivacity of moral feeling on this subject that must electrify our paralyzed vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>For this reason, therefore, I rejoice when I see minds like your lordship's turning to this subject; and I feel an intensity of emotion, as if I could say, Do not for <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0181.0010.00167.00644" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:8"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s sake let go; you know not what you may do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>Your lordship will permit me to send you <num value="2">two</num> of the most characteristic documents of the present struggle, written by <num value="2">two</num> men who are, in their way, as eloquent for the slave as <placeName reg="Chatham, Kent, England" key="tgn,7011586">Chatham</placeName> was for us in our hour of need.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>I am now preparing some additional notes to my book, in which I shall further confirm what I have said by facts and statistics, and in particular by extracts from the <hi rend="italics">codes of slaveholding States</hi>, and the <hi rend="italics">records of their courts</hi>. These are documents that cannot be disputed, and I pray your lordship to give them your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>No disconnected facts can be so terrible as these legal decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>They will soon appear in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>It is so far from being irrelevant for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to notice slavery that I already see indications that this subject, on <hi rend="italics">both sides</hi>, is yet to be presented there, and <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> the battle fought on <hi rend="italics"><name>English</name> ground</hi>. I see that my friend the <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> gentleman has sent to <quote><persName n="Fraser,,,,," id="n0181.0010.00168.00645" reg="mostcommon:Fraser,nomatch:0"><surname>Fraser</surname></persName>'s magazine</quote> an article, before published in this country, on <title><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s Cabin</title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>The article in the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <name>Times</name></orgName> was eagerly reprinted in this country, was issued as a tract and sold by the <num value="100">hundred</num>, headed, <quote>What they think of <q direct="unspecified"><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName></q> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>If I mistake not, a strong effort will be made to pervert the public mind of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and to do away the impression which the book has left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>For a time after it was issued it seemed to go by acclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>From quarters the most unexpected, from all political parties, came an almost unbroken chorus of approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>I was very much surprised, knowing the explosive nature of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>It was not till the sale had run to over a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> copies that reaction began, and the reaction was led off by the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <name>Times</name></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>Instantly, as by a preconcerted signal, all papers of a certain class began to abuse; and some who had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> issued articles entirely commendatory, now issued others equally depreciatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>Religious papers, notably the <title><orgName n="New York Observer" type="newspaper">New York Observer</orgName></title>, came out and denounced the book as <hi rend="italics">anti-Christian</hi>, antievangelical, resorting even to personal slander on the author as a means of diverting attention from the work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>All this has a meaning, but I think it comes too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>I can think of no reason why it was not tried sooner, excepting that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had intended that the cause should have a hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>It is strange that they should have waited so long for the political effect of a book which they might have foreseen at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but not strange that they should, now they <hi rend="italics">do</hi> see what it is doing, attempt to root it up. <pb id="p.169" n="169"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>The effects of the book so far have been, I think, these: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>To soften and moderate the bitterness of feeling in <hi rend="italics">extreme abolitionists</hi>. <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>To convert to abolitionist views many whom this same bitterness had repelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>To inspire the free colored people with self-respect, hope, and confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>To inspire universally through the country a kindlier feeling toward the negro race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>It was unfortunate for the cause of freedom that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> agitators of this subject were of that class which your lordship describes in your note as <quote>well-meaning men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>I speak sadly of their faults, for they were men of <hi rend="italics">noble</hi> hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/><quote>But oppression maketh a wise man <hi rend="italics">mad</hi>,</quote> and they spoke and did many things in the frenzy of outraged humanity that repelled sympathy and threw multitudes off to a hopeless distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>It is mournful to think of all the absurdities that have been said and done in the name and for the sake of this holy cause, that have so long and so fatally retarded it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>I confess that I expected for myself nothing but abuse from extreme abolitionists, especially as I dared to name a forbidden shibboleth, <quote><placeName key="tgn,1000171" n="1.000 3" reg="liberia,africa">Liberia</placeName>,</quote> and the fact that the wildest and extremest abolitionists united with the coldest conservatives, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to welcome and advance the book is a thing that I have never ceased to wonder at.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>I have written this long letter because I am extremely desirous that some leading minds in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> should know how <hi rend="italics">we</hi> stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>The subject is now on trial at the bar of a civilized world &mdash; a <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName>!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>My lord, before you wrote me I read with deep emotion your letter to the ladies of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and subsequently the noble address of the <rs>Duchess</rs> of <persName n="Sutherland,,,,," id="n0181.0010.00170.00651" reg="mostcommon:Sutherland,Harriet,,,:1"><surname>Sutherland</surname></persName>, and I could not but feel that such movements, <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> originating in such <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>, prompted by a spirit so devout and benevolent, were truly of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and must result in a blessing to the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>I grieve to see that both in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and this country there are those who are entirely incapable of appreciating the <rs>Christian</rs> and truly friendly feeling that prompted this movement, and that there are even those who meet it with coarse personalities such as I had not thought possible in an English or <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName> paper.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>When I wrote my work it was in simplicity and in the love of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0181.0010.00171.00652" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:8"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, and if I felt anything that seemed to me like a call to undertake it, it was this, that I had a true heart of love for the <rs>Southern</rs> people, a feeling appreciation of their trials, and a sincere admiration of their many excellent traits, and that I thus felt, I think, must appear to every impartial reader of the work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>It was my hope that a book so kindly intended, so favorable in many respects, might be permitted free circulation among them, and that the gentle voice of <placeName reg="Eva">Eva</placeName> and the manly generosity of St. Clare might be allowed to say those things of the system which would be invidious in any other form.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the book seemed to go by acclamation; the <rs>South</rs> did not condemn, and the <rs>North</rs> was loud and unanimous in praise; not a dissenting voice was raised; to my astonishment everybody praised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>But when the book circulated so widely and began to penetrate the <rs>Southern States</rs>, when it began to be perceived how powerfully it affected every mind that read it, there came on a reaction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>Answers, pamphlets, newspaper attacks came thick <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> and fast, and certain Northern papers, religious,--so called,--turned and began to denounce the work as unchristian, heretical, etc. The reason of all this is that it has been seen that the book has a direct tendency to do what it was written for,--to awaken conscience in the slaveholding States and lead to emancipation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>Now there is nothing that Southern political leaders and capitalists so dread as anti-slavery feeling among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>All the force of lynch law is employed to smother discussion and blind conscience on this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>The question is not allowed to be discussed, and he who sells a book or publishes a tract makes himself liable to fine and imprisonment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>My book is, therefore, as much under an interdict in some parts of the <rs>South</rs> as the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> is in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>It is not allowed in the bookstores, and the greater part of the people hear of it and me only through grossly caricatured representations in the papers, with garbled extracts from the book.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>A cousin residing in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> this winter says that the prejudice against my name is so strong that she dares not have it appear on the outside of her letters, and that very amiable and excellent people have asked her if such as I could be received into reputable society at the <rs>North</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>Under these circumstances, it is a matter of particular regret that the <title><orgName n="New York Observer" type="newspaper">New York Observer</orgName></title>, an old and long-established religious paper in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, extensively read at the <rs>South</rs>, should have come out in such a bitter and unscrupulous style of attack as even to induce some Southern papers, with a generosity <num value="1">one</num> often finds at the <rs>South</rs>, to protest against it. <pb id="p.173" n="173"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>All those things, of course, cannot touch me in my private capacity, sheltered as I am by a happy home and very warm friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>I only grieve for it as a dishonor to <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0181.0010.00173.00654" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> and a real injustice to many noble-minded people at the <rs>South</rs>, who, if they were allowed quietly and dispassionately to hear and judge, might be led to the best results.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/><hi rend="italics">My dear Sir</hi>,--<hi rend="italics">I</hi> cannot but say I am greatly obliged to you for the kind opinions expressed in your letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>On <num value="1">one</num> point, however, it appears that my book has not faithfully represented to you the feelings of my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>I mean in relation to the <rs>English</rs> nation as a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>You will notice that the remarks on that subject occur in the <hi rend="italics">dramatic</hi> part of the book, in the mouth of an intelligent Southerner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>As a fair-minded person, bound to state for both sides all that could be said in the person of St. Clare, the best that could be said on that point, and what I know <hi rend="italics">is</hi> in fact constantly reiterated, namely, that the laboring class of the <rs>South</rs> are in many respects, as to physical comfort, in a better condition than the poor of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>This is the slaveholder's stereotyped apology,--a defense it cannot be, unless <num value="2">two</num> wrongs make <num value="1">one</num> right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>It is generally supposed among us that this estimate of the relative condition of the slaves and the poor of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is correct, and we base our ideas on reports made in Parliament and various documentary evidence; also such sketches as <title><placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> labor and <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> poor</title>, which have been widely circulated among us. The inference, <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> however, which <hi rend="italics">we</hi> of the freedom party draw from it, is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> that the slave is, on the whole, in the best condition because of this striking difference; that in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> the slave has not a recognized <hi rend="italics">human</hi> character <hi rend="italics">in law, has not even an existence</hi>, whereas in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the law recognizes and protects the meanest subject, in theory <hi rend="italics">always</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">infact</hi> to a certain extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>A prince of the blood could not strike the meanest laborer without a liability to prosecution, in <hi rend="italics">theory</hi> at least, and that is something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>In <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> any man may strike any slave he meets, and if the master does not choose to notice it, he has no redress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>I do not suppose <hi rend="italics">human nature</hi> to be widely different in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>In both countries, when any class holds power and wealth by institutions which in the long run bring misery on lower classes, they are very unwilling still to part with that wealth and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>They are unwilling to be convinced that it is their duty, and unwilling to do it if they are. It is always so everywhere; it is not <name>English</name> nature or <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName> nature, but human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>We have seen in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the battle for popular rights fought step by step with as determined a resistance from parties in possession as the slaveholder offers in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>There was the same kind of resistance in certain quarters there to the laws restricting the employing of young children <measure n="18hours" type="date">eighteen hours</measure> a day in factories, as there is here to the anti-slavery effort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>Again, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> as in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, there are, in those very classes whose interests are most invaded by what are called popular rights, some of the most determined supporters of them, and here I think that the balance <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> preponderates in favor of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>I think there are more of the high nobility of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> who are friends of the common people and willing to help the cause of human progress, irrespective of its influence on their own interests, than there are those of a similar class among slaveholding aristocracy, though even that class is not without such men. But I am far from having any of that senseless prejudice against the <rs>English</rs> nation as a nation which, greatly to my regret, I observe sometimes in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>It is a relic of barbarism for <num value="2">two</num> such nations as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> to cherish any such unworthy prejudice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>For my own part, I am proud to be of <name>English</name> blood; and though I do not think <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s national course faultless, and though I think many of her institutions and arrangements capable of much revision and improvement, yet my heart warms to her as, <hi rend="italics">on the whole</hi>, the strongest, greatest, and best nation on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>Have not <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> blood, <num value="1">one</num> language, <num value="1">one</num> literature, and a glorious literature it is!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>I was married when I was <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> old to a man rich in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> and Hebrew, Latin and Arabic, and, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>rich in nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>When I went to housekeeping, my entire stock of china for parlor and kitchen was bought for <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>But then I was abundantly enriched with wealth of another sort.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>I had <num value="2">two</num> little, curly-headed twin daughters to begin with, and my stock in this line has gradually increased, till I have been the mother of <num value="7">seven</num> children, the most beautiful and the most loved of whom lies buried near my <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>It was at his dying bed and at his grave that I learned what a poor slave mother may feel when her child is torn away from her.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>I allude to this here because I have often felt that much that is in that book (<title><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName></title> ) had its root in the awful scenes and bitter sorrows of that summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>It has left now, I trust, no trace on my mind, except a deep compassion for the sorrowful, especially for mothers who are separated from their children.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>During long years of struggling with poverty and sickness, and a hot, debilitating climate, my children grew up around me. The nursery and the kitchen were my principal fields of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>Some of my friends, pitying my trials, copied and sent a number of little sketches from my pen to certain liberally paying <quote>Annuals</quote> with my name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>With the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> money that I earned in this way I bought a <rs n="feather bed" type="product">feather-bed</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>for as I had married into poverty and without a dowry, and as my husband had only a large library of books and a great deal of learning, the bed and pillows were thought the most profitable investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>After this I thought that I had discovered the philosopher's stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>So when a new carpet or mattress was going to be needed, or when, at the close of the year, it began to be evident that my family accounts, like poor <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Dora</placeName>'s, <quote>would n't add up,</quote> then I used to say to my faithful friend and factotum <persName><foreName>Anna</foreName></persName>, who shared all my joys and sorrows, <quote>Now, if you will keep the babies and attend to the things in the house for <num value="1">one</num> day, I'll write a piece, and then we shall be out of the scrape.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>So many letters that it took <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> from <time value="9am">nine in the morning</time> till <num value="2">two</num> in the afternoon to read and answer them in the shortest manner; letters from all classes of people, high and low, rich and poor, in all shades and styles of composition, poetry and prose; some mere outbursts of feeling; some invitations; some advice and suggestions; some requests and inquiries; some presenting books, or flowers, or fruit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>Then came, in their turn, deputations from <placeName reg="Paisley, Glasgow, Scotland" key="tgn,7009107">Paisley</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1050717" n="1.000 2" reg="greenock,inverclyde,scotland,united kingdom,europe">Greenock</placeName>, <placeName reg="Dundee, Dundee, Scotland" key="tgn,7009741">Dundee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland" key="tgn,7009782">Aberdeen</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland" key="tgn,7012112">Belfast</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>; calls of friendship, invitations of all descriptions to go everywhere, and to see everything, and to stay in so many places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/><num value="1">One</num> kind, venerable minister, with his lovely daughter, offered me a retreat in his quiet manse on the beautiful shores of the <rs>Clyde</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>For all these kindnesses, what could I give in return?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>There was scarce time for even a grateful thought on <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>People have often said to me that it must have been an exceeding bore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>For my part, I could not think of regarding it so. It only oppressed me with an unutterable sadness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>In the afternoon I rode out with the lord provost to see the cathedral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>The lord provost answers to the <rs type="role" reg="Lord Mayor">lord mayor</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>As I saw the way to the cathedral blocked up by a throng of people who had come out to see me, I could not help saying, <quote>What went ye out for to see?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>a reed shaken with the wind?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>In fact I was so worn out that I could hardly walk through the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>The next morning I was so ill as to need a physician, unable to see any <num value="1">one</num> that called, or to hear any of the letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>I passed most of the day in bed, but in the evening I had to get up, as I had engaged to drink tea with <num value="2000">two thousand</num> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>Our kind friends, <persName n="Wardlaw,Doctor,,,," id="n0181.0012.00212.00799" reg="mostcommon:Wardlaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName><surname n="Wardlaw"></surname></persName> and <persName n="Wardlaw,Mrs.,,,," id="n0181.0012.00212.00800" reg="mostcommon:Wardlaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wardlaw</surname></persName>, came after us, and Mr. S. and I went in the carriage with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>Our carriage stopped at last at the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>I have a dim remembrance of a way being made for us through a great crowd all round the house, and of going with <persName n="Wardlaw,Mrs.,,,," id="n0181.0012.00212.00801" reg="mostcommon:Wardlaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wardlaw</surname></persName> up into a dressing-room where I met and shook hands with many friendly people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>Then we passed into a gallery, where a seat was reserved for our party, directly in front of the audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>Our friend <persName n="Paton,,Bailie,,," id="n0181.0012.00212.00802" reg="default:Paton,Bailie,,,"><foreName>Bailie</foreName> <surname>Paton</surname></persName> presided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>I told you it was a tea-party; but <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> the arrangements were altogether different from any I had ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>There were narrow tables stretched up and down the whole extent of the great hall, and every person had an appointed seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>These tables were set out with cups and saucers, cakes, biscuit, etc., and when the proper time came, attendants passed along serving tea. The arrangements were so accurate and methodical that the whole multitude actually took tea together, without the least apparent inconvenience or disturbance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>There was a gentle, subdued murmur of conversation all over the house, the sociable clinking of teacups and teaspoons, while the entertainment was going on. It seemed to me such an odd idea, I could not help wondering what sort of a teapot that must be in which all this tea for <num value="2000">two thousand</num> people was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>Truly, as Hadji Baba says, I think they must have had the <quote>father of all the tea-kettles</quote> to boil it in. I could not help wondering if old mother <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 5" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName> had put <num value="2000">two thousand</num> teaspoonfuls of tea for the company, and <num value="1">one</num> for the teapot, as is our good <name>Yankee</name> custom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>We had quite a sociable time up in our gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>Our tea-table stretched quite across, and we drank tea in sight of all the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>By <hi rend="italics">we</hi>, I mean a great number of ministers and their wives, and ladies of the <name>Anti</name>-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">Slavery Society</orgName>, besides our party, and the friends whom I have mentioned before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>All seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>After tea they sang a few verses of the <num value="70">seventy</num>second psalm in the old Scotch version.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>To-day a large party of us started on a small steamer to go down the <rs>Clyde</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>It was a trip full of pleasure and incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>Now we were shown the remains <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> of old <placeName reg="Cardross Castle">Cardross Castle</placeName>, where it was said <persName n="Bruce,,Robert,,," id="n0181.0012.00214.00804" reg="default:Bruce,Robert,,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Bruce</surname></persName> breathed his last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>And now we came near the beautiful grounds of Roseneath, a green, velvet-like peninsula, stretching out into the widening waters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>Somewhere about here I was presented, by his own request, to a broad-shouldered Scotch farmer, who stood some <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <num value="2">two</num>, and who paid me the compliment to say that he had read my book, and that he would walk <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> to see me any day. Such a flattering evidence of discriminating taste, of course, disposed my heart towards him; but when I went up and put my hand into his great prairie of a palm, I was as a grasshopper in my own eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>I inquired who he was and was told he was <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName><persName n="Argyll,,,,," id="n0181.0012.00214.00805" reg="mostcommon:Argyll,Elizabeth,,,:1"><surname>Argyll</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>ers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>I thought to myself if all the duke's farmers were of this pattern, that he might be able to speak to the enemy in the gates to some purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>It was concluded after we left Roseneath that, instead of returning by the boat, we should take carriage and ride home along the banks of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>In our carriage were <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S. and myself, <persName n="Robson,Doctor,,,," id="n0181.0012.00214.00806" reg="mostcommon:Robson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Robson</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Anderson,Lady,,,," id="n0181.0012.00214.00807" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>About this time I commenced my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essay towards giving titles, and made, as you may suppose, rather an odd piece of work of it, generally saying <quote><rs type="role">Mrs.</rs></quote> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and <quote><rs type="role2">Lady</rs></quote> afterwards, and then begging pardon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/><persName n="Anderson,Lady,,,," id="n0181.0012.00214.00808" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> laughed and said she would give me a general absolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>She is a truly genial, hearty Scotchwoman, and seemed to enter happily into the spirit of the hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>As we rode on, we found that the news of our coming had spread through the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>People came and stood in their doors, beckoning, bowing, smiling, and <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> waving their handkerchiefs, and the carriage was several times stopped by persons who came to offer flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>I remember, in particular, a group of young girls bringing to the carriage <num value="2">two</num> of the most beautiful children I ever saw, whose little hands literally deluged us with flowers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>At the village of <placeName reg="Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, Scotland" key="tgn,7009097">Helensburgh</placeName> we stopped a little while to call upon <persName n="Bell,Mrs.,,,," id="n0181.0012.00215.00809" reg="mostcommon:Bell,Henry,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName>, the wife of <persName n="Bell,Mister,,,," id="n0181.0012.00215.00810" reg="mostcommon:Bell,Henry,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName>, the inventor of the steamboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>They had prepared a lunch for us, and quite a number of people had come together to meet us, but our friends said there was not time for us to stop.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>We rode through several villages after this, and met everywhere a warm welcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>What pleased me was, that it was not mainly from the literary, nor the rich, nor the great, but the plain, common people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>The butcher came out of his stall and the baker from his shop, the miller dusty with flour, the blooming, comely young mother, with her baby in her arms, all smiling and bowing, with that hearty, intelligent, friendly look, as if they knew we should be glad to see them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>Once, while we stopped to change horses, I, for the sake of seeing something more of the country, walked on. It seems the honest landlord and his wife were greatly disappointed at this; however, they got into the carriage and rode on to see me, and I shook hands with them with a right good will.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>We saw several of the clergymen, who came out to meet us; and I remember stopping just to be introduced, <pb id="p.216" n="216"/> <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, to a most delightful family, a grayheaded father and mother, with comely brothers and fair sisters, all looking so kindly and homelike, that I should have been glad to accept the invitation they gave me to their dwelling.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>This day has been a strange phenomenon to me. In the first place, I have seen in all these villages how universally the people read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>I have seen how capable they are of a generous excitement and enthusiasm, and how much may be done by a work of fiction so written as to enlist those sympathies which are common to all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>Certainly a great deal may be effected in this way, if <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gives to any <num value="1">one</num> the power, as I hope he will to many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>The power of fictitious writing, for good as well as evil, is a thing which ought most seriously to be reflected on. No <num value="1">one</num> can fail to see that in our day it is becoming a very great agency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2336"/>We came home quite tired, as you may well suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>You will not be surprised that the next day I found myself more disposed to keep my bed than go out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/><measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> later: We bade farewell to <persName n="Glasgow,,,,," id="n0181.0012.00216.00813" reg="mostcommon:Glasgow,nomatch:0"><surname>Glasgow</surname></persName>, overwhelmed with kindness to the last, and only oppressed by the thought of how little that was satisfactory we were able to give in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>Again we were in the railroad car on our way to <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>The drab dresses and pure white bonnets of many Friends were conspicuous among the dense moving crowd, as white doves seen against a dark cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>I was inexpressibly touched and affected by this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>While we were passing the monument of <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0181.0012.00217.00816" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Walter,,,:2"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>, I felt an oppressive melancholy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>What a moment life seems in the presence of the noble dead!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>What a momentary thing is art, in all its beauty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>Where are all those great souls that have created such an atmosphere of light about <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>and how little a space was given them to live and enjoy!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>We drove all over <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName>, up to the castle, to the university, to Holyrood, to the hospitals, and through many of the principal streets, amid shouts, and smiles, and greetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>Some boys amused me very much by their pertinacious attempts to keep up with the carriage.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>The various engravers who have amused themselves by diversifying my face for the public having all, with great unanimity, agreed in giving prominence to this point, I suppose the urchins thought they were on safe ground there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>I certainly think I answered <num value="1">one</num> good purpose that day, and that is of giving the muchop-pressed and calumniated class called boys an opportunity to develop all the noise that was in them,--a thing for which I think they must bless me in their remembrances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/><pb id="p.218" n="218"/></p> 
<p>At last the carriage drove into a deep-graveled yard, and we alighted at a porch covered with green ivy, and found ourselves once more at home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>You may spare your anxieties about me, for I do assure you that if I were an old <placeName key="tgn,7007999" n="1.000 1" reg="sevres,hauts-de-seine,ile-de-france,france,europe">Sevres</placeName> china jar I could not have more careful handling than I do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>Everybody seems to understand how good-for-nothing I am; and yet, with all this consideration, I have been obliged to keep my room and bed for a good part of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>Of the multitudes who have called, I have seen scarcely any.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>We went with the lord provost in his carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>We went up as before into a dressing-room, where I was presented to many gentlemen and ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>When we go in, the cheering, clapping, and stamping at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> strikes <num value="1">one</num> with a strange sensation; but then everybody looks so heartily pleased and delighted, and there is such an all-pervading atmosphere of geniality and sympathy, as makes me in a few moments feel quite at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>After all, I consider that these cheers and applauses are <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 5" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>'s voice to <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, a recognition of the brotherhood of the countries.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>It is to my mind extremely touching to see how the poor, in their poverty, can be moved to a generosity surpassing that of the rich.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>Nor do I mourn that they took it from their slender store, because I know that a penny given from a kindly impulse is a greater comfort <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> and blessing to the poorest giver than even a per.ny received.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>I knew that if I shrank from supporting my position, the sympathy which the work had excited would gradually die out, and the whole thing would be looked upon as a mere romantic excitement of the passions.</p>

I do not think there is a mother who clasps her child to her breast who would ever be made to feel it right that that child should be a slave, not a mother among us who would not rather lay that child in its grave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/> Nor can I believe that there is a woman so unchristian <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> as to think it right to inflict upon her neighbor's child what she would consider worse than death were it inflicted upon her own. I do not believe there is a wife who would think it right that <hi rend="italics">her</hi> husband should be sold to a trader to be worked all his life without wages or a recognition of rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>I do not believe there is a husband who would consider it right that his wife should be regarded by law the property of another man. I do not believe there is a father or mother who would consider it right were they forbidden by law to teach their children to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>I do not believe there is a brother who would think it right to have his sister held as property, with no legal defense for her personal honor, by any man living.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/> All this is inherent in slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>It is not the abuse of slavery, but its legal nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>And there is not a woman in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, where the question is fairly put to her, who thinks these things are right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>But though our hearts have bled over this wrong, there have been many things tending to fetter our hands, to perplex our efforts, and to silence our voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>We have been told that to speak of it was an invasion of the rights of states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>We have heard of promises and compacts, and the natural expression of feeling has in many cases been repressed by an appeal to those honorable sentiments which respect the keeping of engagements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/> But a time has now come when the subject is arising under quite a different aspect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/> The question is not now, shall the wrongs of slavery exist as they have within their own territories, but shall we permit them to be extended all over the free <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> territories of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>Shall the woes and the miseries of slavery be extended over a region of fair, free, unoccupied territory nearly equal in extent to the whole of the free States?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>Nor is this all!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>This is not the last thing that is expected or intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>Should this movement be submitted to in silence, should the <rs>North</rs> consent to this solemn breach of contract on the part of the <rs>South</rs>, there yet remains <num value="1">one</num> more step to be apprehended, namely, the legalizing of slavery throughout the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>By a decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">supreme court</orgName> in the <name>Lemmon</name> case, it may be declared lawful for slave property to be held in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>Women of the free States!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>the question is not shall we remonstrate with slavery on its own soil, but are we willing to receive slavery into the free States and Territories of this Union?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>Shall the whole power of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> go into the hands of slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>Shall every State in the <rs>Union</rs> be thrown open to slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>This is the possible result and issue of the question now pending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>This is the fearful crisis at which we stand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/> And now you ask, What can the <hi rend="italics">women</hi> of a country do?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/> O women of the free States!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>what did your brave mothers do in the days of our Revolution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>Did not liberty in those days feel the strong impulse of woman's heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/><pb id="p.258" n="258"/></p> 
<p>There was never a great interest agitating a community where woman's influence was not felt for good or for evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>At the time when the abolition of the slave-trade was convulsing <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, women contributed more than any other laborers to that great triumph of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>The women of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> refused to receive into their houses the sugar raised by slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/><num value="70000">Seventy thousand</num> families thus refused the use of sugar in testimony of their abhorrence of the manner in which it was produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>At that time women were unwearied in going from house to house distributing books and tracts upon the subject, and presenting it clearly and forcibly to <num value="1000">thousands</num> of families who would otherwise have disregarded it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>The women all over <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were associated in corresponding circles for prayer and labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>Petitions to the government were prepared and signed by women of every station in all parts of the kingdom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>Women of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>we do not know with what thrilling earnestness the hopes and the eyes of the world are fastened upon our country, and how intense is the desire that we should take a stand for universal liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>When I was in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, although I distinctly stated that the raising of money was no part of my object there, it was actually forced upon me by those who could not resist the impulse to do something for this great cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>Nor did it come from the well-to-do alone; but hundreds of most affecting letters were received from poor working men and women, who inclosed small sums in postage-stamps to be devoted to freeing slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/> Nor is this deep feeling confined to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Why do foreign lands regard us with this intensity of interest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>Is it not because the whole world looks hopefully toward <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> as a nation especially raised by <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to advance the cause of human liberty and religion?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/> There has been a universal expectation that the next step taken by <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> would surely be <num value="1">one</num> that should have a tendency to right this great wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>Those who are struggling for civil and religious liberty in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> speak this word <quote>slavery</quote> in sad whispers, as <num value="1">one</num> names a fault of a revered friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>They can scarce believe the advertisements in American papers of slave sales of men, women, and children, traded like cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>Scarcely can they trust their eyes when they read the laws of the slave States, and the decisions of their courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>The advocates of despotism hold these things up to them and say: <quote>See what comes of republican liberty!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>Hitherto the answer has been, <quote>America is more than half free, and she certainly will in time repudiate slavery altogether.</quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty of every American woman at this time is to thoroughly understand the subject for herself, <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> and to feel that she is bound to use her influence for the right.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/> Above all, it seems to be necessary and desirable that we should make this subject a matter of earnest prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>A conflict is now begun between the forces of liberty and despotism throughout the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>We who are Christians, and believe in the sure word of prophecy, know that fearful convulsions and overturnings are predicted before the coming of Him who is to rule the earth in righteousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>How important, then, in this crisis, that all who believe in prayer should retreat beneath the shadow of the <name>Almighty</name>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/> It is a melancholy but unavoidable result of such great encounters of principle that they tend to degenerate into sectional and personal bitterness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>It is this liability that forms <num value="1">one</num> of the most solemn and affecting features of the crisis now presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>We are on the eve of a conflict which will try men's souls, and strain to the utmost the bonds of brotherly union that bind this nation together.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/> Let us, then, pray that in the agitation of this question between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> the war of principle may not become a mere sectional conflict, degenerating into the encounter of physical force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>Let us <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> raise our hearts to Him who has the power to restrain the wrath of men, that He will avert the consequences that our sins as a nation so justly deserve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/> There are many noble minds in the <rs>South</rs> who do not participate in the machinations of their political leaders, and whose sense of honor and justice is outraged by this proposition equally with our own.

<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>About <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, as I had just tranquilly laid down in my berth, I was roused by a grating crash, accompanied by a shock that shook the whole ship, and followed by the sound of a general rush on deck, trampling, scuffling, and cries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>I rushed to the door and saw all the gentlemen hurrying on their clothes and getting confusedly towards the stairway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>I went back to <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, and we put on our things in silence, and, as soon as we could, got into the upper saloon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>It was an hour before we could learn anything certainly, except that we <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> had run into another vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>The fate of the <rs>Arctic</rs> came to us both, but we did not mention it to each other; indeed, a quieter, more silent company you would not often see. Had I had any confidence in the administration of the boat, it would have been better, but as I had not, I sat in momentary uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>Had we then known, as we have since, the fate of a boat recently sunk in the <name>Mediterranean</name> by a similar carelessness, it would have increased our fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>By a singular chance an officer, whose wife and children were lost on board that boat, was on board ours, and happened to be on the forward part of the boat when the accident occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>The captain and mate were both below; there was nobody looking out, and had not this officer himself called out to stop the boat, we should have struck her with such force as to have sunk us. As it was, we turned aside and the shock came on a paddlewheel, which was broken by it, for when, after <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> delay, we tried to start and had gone a little way, there was another crash and the paddle-wheel fell down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>You may be sure we did little sleeping that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>It was an inexpressible desolation to think that we might never again see those we loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>No <num value="1">one</num> knows how much <num value="1">one</num> thinks, and how rapidly, in such hours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>In the <name>Naples</name> boat that was sunk a short time ago, the women perished in a dreadful way. The shock threw the chimney directly across the egress from below, so that they could not get on deck, and they were all drowned in the cabin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>We went limping along with <num value="1">one</num> broken limb till the next day about <num value="11">eleven</num>, when we reached Civita <pb id="p.296" n="296"/> Vecchia, where there were <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> more of delay about passports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/>Then we, that is, <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> and I, and <persName n="Edison,Doctor,,,," id="n0181.0016.00296.01116" reg="mostcommon:Edison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">a Dr.</roleName> <surname>Edison</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, with his son <persName><foreName>Alfred</foreName></persName>, took a carriage to <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, but they gave us a miserable thing that looked as if it had been made soon after the deluge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>About <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> at night, on a lonely stretch of road, the wheel came off. We got out, and our postilions stood silently regarding matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>None of us could speak <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0181.0016.00296.01117" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName>, they could not speak <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0181.0016.00296.01118" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>; but the driver at last conveyed the idea that for <num value="5">five</num> francs he could get a man to come and mend the wheel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>The <num value="5">five</num> francs were promised, and he untackled a horse and rode off. <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> and I walked up and down the dark, desolate road, occasionally reminding each other that we were on classic ground, and laughing at the oddity of our lonely, starlight promenade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>After a while our driver came back, Tag, Rag, and Bobtail at his heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/>I don't think I can do greater justice to <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0181.0016.00296.01119" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> costumes than by this respectable form of words.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>Then there was another consultation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/>They put a bit of rotten timber under to pry the carriage up. Fortunately, it did not break, as we all expected it would, till after the wheel was on. Then a new train of thought was suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/>How was it to be kept on?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>Evidently they had not thought far in that direction, for they had brought neither hammer nor nail, nor tool of any kind, and therefore they looked <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at the wheel, then at each other, and then at us. The doctor now produced a little gimlet, with the help of which the broken fragments of the former linchpin were pushed out, and the way was cleared for a new <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3277"/>Then they began knocking a fence to pieces to get out <pb id="p.297" n="297"/> nails, but none could be found to fit. At last another ambassador was sent back for nails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>While we were thus waiting, the diligence, in which many of our ship's company were jogging on to <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, came up. They had plenty of room inside, and <num value="1">one</num> of the party, seeing our distress, tried hard to make the driver stop, but he doggedly persisted in going on, and declared if anybody got down to help us he would leave him behind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>An interesting little episode here occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>It was raining, and <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> and I proposed, as the wheel was now on, to take our seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>We had no sooner done so than the horses were taken with a sudden fit of animation and ran off with us in the most vivacious manner, Tag, Rag, and Co. shouting in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>Some heaps of stone a little in advance presented an interesting prospect by way of a terminus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>However, the horses were luckily captured before the wheel was off again; and our ambassador being now returned, we were set right and again proceeded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>I must not forget to remark that at every post where we changed horses and drivers, we had a pitched battle with the driver for more money than we had been told was the regular rate, and the carriage was surrounded with a perfect mob of ragged, shock-headed, black-eyed people, whose words all ended in <quote>ino,</quote> and who raved and ranted at us till finally we paid much more than we ought, to get rid of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>At the gates of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> the official, after looking at our passports, coolly told the doctor that if he had a mind to pay him <num value="5">five</num> francs he could go in without further disturbance, but if not he would keep the baggage till morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>This form of statement had the <pb id="p.298" n="298"/> recommendation of such precision and neatness of expression that we paid him forthwith, and into <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> we dashed at <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the morning of the <dateStruct value="1857-02-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year>1857</year>,</dateStruct> in a drizzling rain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>We drove to the <rs type="place">Hotel</rs> d'angleterre,--it was full, -and ditto to <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> others, and in the last effort our refractory wheel came off again, and we all got out into the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>About a dozen lean, ragged <quote>corbies,</quote> who are called porters and who are always lying in wait for travelers, pounced upon us. They took down our baggage in a twinkling, and putting it all into the street surrounded it, and chattered over it, while M. and I stood in the rain and received <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lessons in <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>How we did try to say something!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/>but they couldn't talk anything but in <quote>ino</quote> as aforesaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>The doctor finally found a man who could speak a word or <num value="2">two</num> of <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0181.0016.00298.01120" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, and leaving <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, <persName><foreName>Alfred</foreName></persName>, and me to keep watch over our pile of trunks, he went off with him to apply for lodgings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>I have heard many flowery accounts of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impressions of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>I must say ours was somewhat sombre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>A young man came by and addressed us in <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0181.0016.00298.01121" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/>How cheering!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>We almost flew upon him. We begged him, at least, to lend us his <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0181.0016.00298.01122" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> to call another carriage, and he did so. A carriage which was passing was luckily secured, and <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> and I, with all our store of boxes and little parcels, were placed in it out of the rain, at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/>Here we sat while the doctor from time to time returned from his wanderings to tell us he could find no place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/><quote>Can it be,</quote> said I, <quote>that we are to be obliged to spend a night in the streets?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>What made it seem more odd was the knowledge that, <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> could we only find them, we had friends enough in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> who would be glad to entertain us. We began to speculate on lodgings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>Who knows what we may get entrapped into?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/><persName><foreName>Alfred</foreName></persName> suggested stories he had read of beds placed on trap-doors,--of testers which screwed down on people and smothered them; and so, when at last the doctor announced lodgings found, we followed in rather an uncertain frame of mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>We alighted at a dirty stone passage, smelling of cats and onions, damp, cold, and earthy, we went up stone stairways, and at last were ushered into <num value="2">two</num> very decent chambers, where we might lay our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>The <quote>corbies</quote> all followed us,--black-hai<rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">black</rs>-browed, ragged, and clamorous as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>They insisted that we should pay the pretty little sum of <num value="20">twenty</num> francs, or <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">four dollars</measure>, for bringing our trunks about <num value="20">twenty</num> steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>The doctor modestly but firmly declined to be thus imposed upon, and then ensued a general <quote>chatteration;</quote> <num value="1">one</num> and all fell into attitudes, and the <quote>inos</quote> and <quote>issimos</quote> rolled freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/><quote>For pity's sake get them off,</quote> we said; so we made a truce for <num value="10">ten</num> francs, but still they clamored, forced their way even into our bedroom, and were only repulsed by a loud and combined volley of <quote>No, no, noes!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>which we all set up at once, upon which they retreated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>Our hostess was a little <name>French</name> woman, and that reassured us. I examined the room, and seeing no trace of treacherous testers, or trap-doors, resolved to avail myself without fear of the invitation of a very clean, white bed, where I slept till morning without dreaming.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>The next day we sent our cards to <persName n="Bartholimeu,,M.,,," id="n0181.0016.00299.01123" reg="default:Bartholimeu,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Bartholimeu</surname></persName>, and before we had finished breakfast he was on the <pb id="p.300" n="300"/> spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>We then learned that he had been watching the diligence office for over a week, and that he had the pleasant set of apartments we are now occupying all ready and waiting for us.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3421"/>To say the plain truth, it seems to me so splendid a work of genius that nothing that I can say can give you an idea of the intensity of admiration with which I read it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3484"/>Dear friend,--Before this reaches you you will have perhaps learned from other sources of the sad blow which has fallen upon us,--our darling, our good, beautiful boy, snatched away in the moment of health and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3485"/>Alas! could I know that when I parted from my <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> on <name>English</name> shores that I should never see him more?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3486"/>I returned to my home, and, amid the <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> jubilee of meeting the rest, was fain to be satisfied with only a letter from him, saying that his college examinations were coming on, and he must defer seeing me a week or <num value="2">two</num> till they were over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3487"/>I thought then of taking his younger brother and going up to visit him; but the health of the latter seeming unfavorably affected by the seacoast air, I turned back with him to a water-cure establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3488"/>Before I had been <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> absent a fatal telegram hurried me home, and when I arrived there it was to find the house filled with his weeping classmates, who had just come bringing his remains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3489"/>There he lay so calm, so placid, so peaceful, that I could not believe that he would not smile upon me, and that my voice which always had such power over him could not recall him. There had always been such a peculiar union, such a tenderness between us. I had had such power always to call up answering feelings to my own, that it seemed impossible that he could be silent and unmoved at my grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3490"/>But yet, dear friend, I am sensible that in this last sad scene I had an alleviation that was not granted to you. I recollect, in the mournful letter you wrote me about that time, you said that you mourned that you had never told your own dear <num value="1">one</num> how much you loved him. That sentence touched me at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3491"/>I laid it to heart, and from that time lost no occasion of expressing to my children those feelings that we too often defer to express to our dearest friends till it is forever too late.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3492"/>He did fully know how I loved him, and some of the last loving words he spoke were of me. The very day that he was taken from us, and when he was just rising <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> from the table of his boarding-house to go whence he never returned, some <num value="1">one</num> noticed the seal ring, which you may remember to have seen on his finger, and said, How beautiful that ring is!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3493"/>Yes, he said, and best of all, it was my mother's gift to me. That ring, taken from the lifeless hand a few hours later, was sent to me. Singularly enough, it is broken right across the name from a fall a little time previous ....</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>It is a great comfort to me, dear friend, that I took <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> with me to Dunrobin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>I hesitated about keeping him so long from his studies, but still I thought a mind so observing and appreciative might learn from such a tour more than through books, and so it was. He returned from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> full of high resolves and manly purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/><quote>I may not be what the world calls a Christian,</quote> he wrote, <quote>but I will live such a life as a Christian ought to live, such a life as every true man ought to live.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>Henceforth he became remarkable for a strict order and energy, and a vigilant temperance and care of his bodily health, docility and deference to his parents and teachers, and perseverance in every duty. . . . Well, from the hard battle of this life he is excused, and the will is taken for the deed, and whatever comes his heart will not be pierced as mine is. But I am glad that I can connect him with all my choicest remembrances of the Old World.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>Dunrobin will always be dearer to me now, and I have felt towards you and the duke a turning of spirit, because I remember how kindly you always looked on and spoke to him. I knew then it was the angel of your lost <num value="1">one</num> that stirred your hearts with tenderness when you looked on another so near his age. The plaid that <pb id="p.318" n="318"/> the duke gave him, and which he valued as <num value="1">one</num> of the chief of his boyish treasures, will hang in his roomfor still we have a room that we call his.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>You will understand, you will feel, this sorrow with us as few can. My poor husband is much prostrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>I need not say more: you know what this must be to a father's heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>But still I repeat what I said when I saw you last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/>Our dead are ministering angels; they teach us to love, they fill us with tenderness for all that can suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3503"/>These weary hours when sorrow makes us for the time blind and deaf and dumb, have their promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>These hours come in answer to our prayers for nearness to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> It is always our treasure that the lightning strikes .... I have poured out my heart to you because you can understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>While I was visiting in <placeName reg="Hannover, Niedersachsen, Deutschland" key="tgn,1002450">Hanover</placeName>, where <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> died, a poor, deaf old slave woman, who has still <num value="5">five</num> children in bondage, came to comfort me. <quote>Bear up, dear soul, she said; you must bear it, for the <rs>Lord</rs> loves ye.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>She said further, <quote>Sunday is a heavy day to me, &apos;cause I can't work, and can't hear preaching, and can't read, so I can't keep my mind off my poor children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>Some on 'em the blessed <rs>Master</rs>'s got, and they's safe; but, oh, there are <num value="5">five</num> that I don't know where they are.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>It was so easy to account for the unexampled popularity of <quote> <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName></quote> by attributing it to a cheap sympathy with sentimental philanthropy!

I cannot fancy even so good a girl who would not have laughed at him. Nor can I fancy a man of real intellect reaching such a period of life without understanding his own feelings better, or penetrating those of another more quickly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3708"/>Then I am provoked at nothing happening to <persName n="Scudder,Mrs.,,,," id="n0181.0017.00337.01245" reg="nearbymention:Scudder,Kate,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Scudder</surname></persName>, whom I think as entirely unendurable a creature as ever defied poetical justice at the end of a novel meant to irritate people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>And finally, I think you are too disdainful of what ordinary readers seek in a novel, under the name of <quote>interest,</quote> --that gradually developing wonder, expectation, and curiosity which makes people who have no self-command sit up till <time value="3am">three in the morning</time> to get to the crisis, and people who have self-command lay the book down with a resolute sigh, and think of it all the next day through till the time comes for taking it up again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3710"/>Still, I know well that in many respects it was impossible for you to treat this story merely as a work of literary art. There must have been many facts which you could not dwell upon, and which no <num value="1">one</num> may judge by common rules.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3711"/>It is also true, as you say once or twice in the course of the work, that we have not among us here the peculiar religious earnestness you have mainly to describe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3712"/> We have little earnest formalism, and our formalists are for the most part hollow, feeble, uninteresting, mere stumbling-blocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3713"/>We have the <rs>Simeon Brown</rs> species, <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> indeed; and among readers even of his kind the book may do some good, and more among the weaker, truer people, whom it will shake like mattresses,--making the dust fly, and perhaps with it some of the sticks and quill-ends, which often make that kind of person an objectionable mattress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3714"/>I write too lightly of the book, -far too lightly,--but your letter made me gay, and I have been lighter-hearted ever since; only I kept this after beginning it, because I was ashamed to send it without a line to <persName n="Browning,Mrs.,,,," id="n0181.0017.00338.01246" reg="nearbymention:Browning,Elizabeth,B.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Browning</surname></persName> as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3715"/>I do not understand why you should apprehend (or rather anticipate without apprehension) any absurd criticism on it. It is sure to be a popular book,--not as <quote> <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName></quote> was, for that owed part of its popularity to its dramatic effect (the flight on the ice, etc.), which I did not like; but as a true picture of human life is always popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/>Nor, I should think, would any critics venture at all to carp at it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/> The <rs>Candace</rs> and <rs>Virginie</rs> bits appear to me, as far as I have yet seen, the best.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>When we turn from these criticisms and commendations to the inner history of this period, we find that the work was done in deep sadness of heart, and the undertone of pathos that forms the dark background of the brightest and most humorous parts of <quote>The minister's Wooing</quote> was the unconscious revelation of <num value="1">one</num> of sorrowful spirit, who, weary of life, would have <pb id="p.339" n="339"/> been glad to lie down with her arms <quote>round the wayside cross, and sleep away into a brighter scene.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>My Dear Friend,--I did long to hear from you at a time when few knew how to speak, because I knew that you did know everything that sorrow can teach, --you whose whole life has been a crucifixion, a long ordeal.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>I often think that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> called you to this beautiful and terrible ministry when He suffered you to link your destiny with <num value="1">one</num> so strangely gifted, so fearfully tempted, and that the reward which is to meet you, when you enter within the veil, where you must soon pass, will be to see the angel, once chained and defiled within him, set free from sin and glorified, and so know that to you it has been given, by your life of love and faith, to accomplish this glorious change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>I think very much on the subject on which you conversed with me once,--the future state of retribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/>It is evident to me that the spirit of Christianity has produced in the human spirit a tenderness of love which wholly revolts from the old doctrine on the subject, and I observe the more Christ-like any <num value="1">one</num> becomes, the more impossible it seems for him to accept it; and yet, <pb id="p.340" n="340"/> on the contrary, it was <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0181.0017.00340.01249" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:8"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> who said, <quote>Fear Him that is able to destroy soul and body in hell,</quote> and the most appalling language on this subject is that of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0181.0017.00340.01250" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:8"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>Certain ideas once prevalent certainly must be thrown off. An endless infliction for past sins was once the doctrine that we now generally reject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/>The doctrine as now taught is that of an eternal persistence in evil necessitating eternal punishment, since evil induces misery by an eternal nature of things, and this, I fear, is inferable from the analogies of nature, and confirmed by the whole implication of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>Is there any fair way of disposing of the current of assertion, and the still deeper undercurrent of implication, on this subject, without <num value="1">one</num> which loosens all faith in revelation, and throws us on pure naturalism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>But of <num value="1">one</num> thing I am sure,--probation does not end with this life, and the number of the redeemed may therefore be infinitely greater than the world's history leads us to suppose.</p></body></text> The views expressed in this letter certainly throw light on many passages in <title>The minister's Wooing</title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>The following letter, written to her daughter <persName><foreName>Georgiana</foreName></persName>, is introduced as revealing the spirit in which much of <title>The minister's Wooing</title> was written:--

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>My dear Georgie,--Why have n't I written?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>Because, dear Georgie, I am like the dry, dead, leafless tree, and have only cold, dead, slumbering buds of hope on the end of stiff, hard, frozen twigs of thought, but no leaves, no blossoms; nothing to send to a little girl <pb id="p.341" n="341"/> who does n't know what to do with herself any more than a kitten.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>I let my plants die by inches before my eyes, and do not water them, and I dread everything I do, and wish it was not to be done, and so when I get a letter from my little girl I smile and say, <quote>Dear little puss, I will answer it;</quote> and I sit hour after hour with folded hands, looking at the inkstand and dreading to begin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>The fact is, pussy, mamma is tired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3818"/>My dear husband,--Your letter received to-day has raised quite a weight from my mind, for it shows that at last you have received all mine, and that thus the chain of communication between us is unbroken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3819"/>What you said about your spiritual experiences in feeling <pb id="p.350" n="350"/> the presence of dear <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> with you, and, above all, the vibration of that mysterious guitar, was very pleasant to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3821"/>Without doubt she is what the spiritualists would regard as a very powerful medium, but being a very earnest <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0181.0018.00350.01296" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>, and afraid of getting led astray, she has kept carefully aloof from all circles and things of that nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3822"/>She came and opened her mind to me in the first place, to ask my advice as to what she had better do; relating experiences very similar to many of yours.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3823"/>My advice was substantially to try the spirits whether they were of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,--to keep close to the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and prayer, and then accept whatever came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>But I have found that when I am with her I receive very strong impressions from the spiritual world, so that I feel often sustained and comforted, as if I had been near to my <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> and other departed friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>This has been at times so strong as greatly to soothe and support me. I told her your experiences, in which she was greatly interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4100"/>Sisters,--More than <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> ago you sent to us in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> a document with the above heading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/>It is as follows:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4102"/></p> 
<p>A common origin, a common faith, and, we sincerely believe, a common cause, urge us, at the present moment, to address you on the subject of that system of negro slavery which still prevails so extensively, and, even under kindly disposed masters, with such frightful results, in many of the vast regions of the <orgName n="Western world" type="newspaper">Western world</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4103"/> We will not dwell on the ordinary topics,--on the progress of civilization, on the advance of freedom everywhere, on the rights and requirements of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century; but we appeal to you very seriously to reflect, and to ask counsel of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, how far such a state of things is in accordance with his Holy Word, the inalienable rights of immortal souls, and the pure and merciful spirit of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>We do not shut our eyes to the difficulties, nay, the dangers, that might beset the immediate abolition of that longestablished system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>We see and admit the necessity of preparation for so great an event; but, in speaking of indispensable preliminaries, we cannot be silent on those laws of your country which, in direct contravention of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> own law, <quote>instituted in the time of man's innocency,</quote> <pb id="p.376" n="376"/> deny in effect to the slave the sanctity of marriage, with all its joys, rights, and obligations; which separate, at the will of the master, the wife from the husband, and the children from the parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>Nor can we be silent on that awful system which, either by statute or by custom, interdicts to any race of men, or any portion of the human family, education in the truths of the gospel and the ordinances of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4107"/>A remedy applied to these <num value="2">two</num> evils alone would commence the amelioration of their sad condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4108"/>We appeal to you then, as sisters, as wives, and as mothers, to raise your voices to your fellow-citizens, and your prayers to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, for the removal of this affliction and disgrace from the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4109"/> We do not say these things in a spirit of selfcomplacency, as though our nation were free from the guilt it perceives in others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/> We acknowledge with grief and shame our heavy share in this great sin. We acknowledge that our forefathers introduced, nay compelled the adoption, of slavery in those mighty colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4111"/>We humbly confess it before Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and it is because we so deeply feel and unfeignedly avow our own complicity, that we now venture to implore your aid to wipe away our common crime and our common dishonor.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4112"/>This address, splendidly illuminated on vellum, was sent to our shores at the head of <num value="26">twenty-six</num> folio volumes, containing considerably more than half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of signatures of <name>British</name> women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4113"/>It was forwarded to me with a letter from a British nobleman, now occupying <num value="1">one</num> of the highest official positions in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, with <pb id="p.377" n="377"/> a request on behalf of these ladies that it should be in any possible way presented to the attention of my countrywomen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4114"/>This memorial, as it now stands in its solid oaken case, with its heavy folios, each bearing on its back the imprint of the <rs>American</rs> eagle, forms a most unique library, a singular monument of an international expression of a moral idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4115"/>No right-thinking person can find aught to be objected against the substance or form of this memorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4116"/>It is temperate, just, and kindly; and on the high ground of <name>Christian</name> equality, where it places itself, may be regarded as a perfectly proper expression of sentiment, as between blood relations and equals in <num value="2">two</num> different nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4117"/>The signatures to this appeal are not the least remarkable part of it; for, beginning at the very steps of the throne, they go down to the names of women in the very humblest conditions in life, and represent all that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> possesses, not only of highest and wisest, but of plain, homely common sense and good feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4118"/>Names of wives of cabinet ministers appear on the same page with the names of wives of humble laborers,--names of duchesses and countesses, of wives of generals, ambassadors, savants, and men of letters, mingled with names traced in trembling characters by hands evidently unused to hold the pen, and stiffened by lowly toil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4119"/>Nay, so deep and expansive was the feeling, that <name>British</name> subjects in foreign lands had their representation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4120"/>Among the signatures are those of foreign residents, from <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> to <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4121"/>Autographs so diverse, and collected from sources so various, have seldom been found in juxtaposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4122"/>They remain at this day a silent witness of <pb id="p.378" n="378"/> a most singular tide of feeling which at that time swept over the <rs>British</rs> community and <hi rend="italics">made</hi> for itself an expression, even at the risk of offending the sensibilities of an equal and powerful nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4123"/>No reply to that address, in any such tangible and monumental form, has ever been possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4124"/>It was impossible to canvass our vast territories with the zealous and indefatigable industry with which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was canvassed for signatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4125"/>In <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, those possessed of the spirit which led to this efficient action had no leisure for it. All their time and energies were already absorbed in direct efforts to remove the great evil, concerning which the minds of their <name>English</name> sisters had been newly aroused, and their only answer was the silent continuance of these efforts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4126"/>From the slaveholding States, however, as was to be expected, came a flood of indignant recrimination and rebuke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4127"/>No <num value="1">one</num> act, perhaps, ever produced more frantic irritation, or called out more unsparing abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4128"/>It came with the whole united weight of the <rs>British</rs> aristocracy and commonalty on the most diseased and sensitive part of our national life; and it stimulated that fierce excitement which was working before, and has worked since, till it has broken out into open war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4129"/>The time has come, however, when such an astonishing page has been turned, in the anti-slavery history of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, that the women of our country, feeling that the great anti-slavery work to which their <name>English</name> sisters exhorted them is almost done, may properly and naturally feel moved to reply to their appeal, and lay before them the history of what has occurred since the receipt of their affectionate and <name>Christian</name> address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4130"/><pb id="p.379" n="379"/></p> 
<p>Your address reached us just as a great moral conflict was coming to its intensest point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4131"/>The agitation kept up by the anti-slavery portion of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and by the general sentiment of humanity in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, had made the situation of the slaveholding aristocracy intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4132"/>As <num value="1">one</num> of them at the time expressed it, they felt themselves under the ban of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4133"/><num value="2">Two</num> courses only were open to them: to abandon slave institutions, the sources of their wealth and political power, or to assert them with such an overwhelming national force as to compel the respect and assent of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4134"/>They chose the latter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4135"/>To this end they determined to seize on and control all the resources of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and to spread their institutions through new States and Territories until the balance of power should fall into their hands and they should be able to force slavery into all the free States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4136"/>A leading Southern senator boasted that he would yet call the roll of his slaves on <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>; and for a while the political successes of the slave-power were such as to suggest to <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> that this was no impossible event.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4137"/>They repealed the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, which had hitherto stood like the <name>Chinese</name> wall, between our Northwestern Territories and the irruptions of slaveholding barbarians.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4138"/>Then came the struggle between freedom and slavery in the new territory; the battle for <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName>, fought with fire and sword and blood, where a race of men, of whom <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0181.0020.00379.01419" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> was the immortal type, acted over again the courage, the perseverance, <pb id="p.380" n="380"/> and the military-religious ardor of the old Covenanters of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 5" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and like them redeemed the ark of liberty at the price of their own blood, and blood dearer than their own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4139"/>The time of the <name>Presidential</name> canvass which elected <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0181.0020.00380.01420" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was the crisis of this great battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4140"/>The conflict had become narrowed down to the <num value="1">one</num> point of the extension of slave territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4141"/>If the slaveholders could get States enough, they could control and rule; if they were outnumbered by free States, their institutions, by the very law of their nature, would die of suffocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4142"/>Therefore Fugitive Slave Law, <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, Inter-State Slave-trade, and what not, were all thrown out of sight for a grand rally on this vital point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4143"/>A President was elected pledged to opposition to this <num value="1">one</num> thing alone,--a man known to be in favor of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs> and other so-called compromises of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but honest and faithful in his determination on this <num value="1">one</num> subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4144"/>That this was indeed the vital point was shown by the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4145"/>The moment <rs>Lincoln</rs>'s election was ascertained, the slaveholders resolved to destroy the <rs>Union</rs> they could no longer control.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4146"/>They met and organized a Confederacy which they openly declared to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> republic founded on the right and determination of the white man to enslave the black man, and, spreading their banners, declared themselves to the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName> of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century as a nation organized with the full purpose and intent of perpetuating slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4147"/>But in the course of the struggle that followed, it became important for the new confederation to secure <pb id="p.381" n="381"/> the assistance of foreign powers, and infinite pains were then taken to blind and bewilder the mind of <persName n="England,,,,," id="n0181.0020.00381.01421" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> as to the real issues of the conflict in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4148"/>It has been often and earnestly asserted that slavery had nothing to do with this conflict; that it was a mere struggle for power; that the only object was to restore the <rs>Union</rs> as it was, with all its abuses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4149"/>It is to be admitted that expressions have proceeded from the national administration which naturally gave rise to misapprehension, and therefore we beg to speak to you on this subject more fully.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4150"/>And <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the declaration of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> themselves is proof enough, that, whatever may be declared on the other side, the maintenance of slavery is regarded by them as the vital object of their movement.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4160"/>In the mean while, during the past year, the <rs>Republican</rs> administration, with all the unwonted care of organizing an army and navy, and conducting military operations on an immense scale, have proceeded to demonstrate the feasibility of overthrowing slavery by purely constitutional measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4161"/>To this end they have instituted a series of movements which have made this year more fruitful in anti-slavery triumphs than any other since the emancipation of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">British West Indies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/>The <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, as belonging strictly to the national government and to no separate State, has furnished a fruitful subject of remonstrance from British Christians with <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4165"/>By another act, America has consummated the longdelayed treaty with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> for the suppression of the slave-trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4167"/>This abominable secret traffic has been wholly demolished by the energy of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4168"/>Lastly, and more significant still, the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4169"/>This noble-spirited and generous offer has been urged on the slaveholding States by the chief executive with earnestness and sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4170"/>But this is but half the story of the anti-slavery triumphs of this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4171"/>We have shown you what has been done for freedom by the simple use of the ordinary constitutional forces of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4172"/>We are now to show you what has been done to the same end by the constitutional war-power of the nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4173"/>By this power it has been this year decreed that every slave of a rebel who reaches the lines of our army becomes a free man; that all slaves found deserted by their masters become free men; that every slave employed in any service for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> thereby obtains his liberty; and that every slave employed against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in any capacity obtains his liberty; and lest the army should contain officers disposed to remand slaves to their masters, the power of judging and delivering up slaves is denied to army officers, and all such acts are made penal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4176"/>For be it remembered that our army is almost entirely a volunteer <num value="1">one</num>, and that the most zealous and ardent volunteers are those who have been for years fighting, with tongue and pen, the abolition battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4181"/>This also has been much misunderstood and misrepresented in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4182"/>It has been said to mean virtually this: Be loyal and you shall keep your slaves; rebel and they shall be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4183"/>But let us remember what we have just seen of the purpose and meaning of the <rs>Union</rs> to which the rebellious States are invited back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4184"/>It is to a Union which has abolished slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, and interdicted slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>; which vigorously represses the slave-trade, and hangs the convicted slaver as a pirate; which necessitates emancipation by denying expansion to slavery, and facilitates it by the offer of compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4185"/>Any slaveholding States which should return to such a <pb id="p.385" n="385"/> Union might fairly be supposed to return with the purpose of peaceable emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4186"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s Proclamation simply means this: Come in and emancipate peaceably with compensation; stay out and I emancipate, nor will I protect you from the consequences.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4202"/>When these words reached us we said: <quote>We can wait; our friends in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will soon see whither this conflict is tending.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4204"/>No voice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4205"/>Yes, we have heard on the high seas the voice of a war-steamer, built for a man-stealing Confederacy, with <name>English</name> gold, in an English dockyard, going out of an English harbor, manned by <name>English</name> sailors, with the full knowledge of <name>English</name> government officers, in defiance of the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation of neutrality!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4257"/>Those who are the least favorable to the <name>Northerns</name> are not so from any approbation of slavery, but from not understanding that the war is waged in the cause of abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4258"/><quote>It was waged,</quote> they say, <quote>ostensibly for the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>,</quote> and in attestation of this, they refer to the proclamation which announced the confiscation of slaves that were the property of secessionists, while those who adhered to the <rs>Federal</rs> cause should be exempt from such confiscation, which, <pb id="p.392" n="392"/> they say, did not savor much of zeal for abolition.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4575"/> The facts are of such a nature as to be indelibly impressed upon my mind they appear to me to be curious, and well worth the attention of the psychologist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4576"/>I regard the occurrences in question as the more remarkable because I cannot discover that I possess either taste or talent for fiction or poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4577"/>I have barely imagination enough to enjoy, with a high degree of relish, the works of others in this department of literature, but have never felt able or disposed to engage in that sort of writing myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4578"/>On the contrary, my style has always been remarkable for its dry, matter-of-fact plainness; my mind has been distinguished for its quickness and adaptedness to historical and literary investigations, for ardor and perseverance in pursuit of the knowledge of facts,--<hi rend="italics">eine verstdndige Richtung</hi>, as the <name>Germans</name> would say,--rather than for any other quality; and the only talent of a higher kind which I am conscious of possessing is a turn for accurate observation of men and things, and a certain broad humor and drollery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4579"/> From the hour of my birth I have been constitutionally feeble, as were my parents before me, and my nervous system easily excitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4580"/>With care, however, I have kept myself in tolerable health, and my life has <pb id="p.423" n="423"/> been an industrious <num value="1">one</num>, for my parents were poor and I have always been obliged to labor for my livelihood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4581"/> With these preliminary remarks, I proceed to the curious details of my psychological history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4582"/>As early as I can remember anything, I can remember observing a multitude of animated and active objects, which I could see with perfect distinctness, moving about me, and could sometimes, though seldom, hear them make a rustling noise, or other articulate sounds; but I could never touch them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4583"/>They were in all respects independent of the sense of touch, and incapable of being obstructed in any way by the intervention of material objects; I could see them at any distance, and through any intervening object, with as much ease and distinctness as if they were in the room with me, and directly before my eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4584"/>I could see them passing through the floors, and the ceilings, and the walls of the house, from <num value="1">one</num> apartment to another, in all directions, without a door, or a keyhole, or crevice being open to admit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4585"/>I could follow them with my eyes to any distance, or directly through or just beneath the surface, or up and down, in the midst of boards and timbers and bricks, or whatever else would stop the motion or intercept the visibleness of all other objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4586"/>These appearances occasioned neither surprise nor alarm, except when they assumed some hideous and frightful form, or exhibited some menacing gesture, for I became acquainted with them as soon as with any of the objects of sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4587"/>As to the reality of their existence and the harmlessness of their character, I knew no difference between them and any other of the objects which met my eye. They were <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> as familiar to me as the forms of my parents and my brother; they made up a part of my daily existence, and were as really the subjects of my consciousness as the little bench on which I sat in the corner by my mother's knee, or the wheels and sticks and strings with which I amused myself upon the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4588"/>I indeed recognized a striking difference between them and the things which I could feel and handle, but to me this difference was no more a matter of surprise than that which I observed between my mother and the black woman who so often came to work for her; or between my infant brother and the little spotted dog <persName n="Brutus,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00424.01566" reg="mostcommon:Brutus,nomatch:0"><surname>Brutus</surname></persName> of which I was so fond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4589"/>There was no time, or place, or circumstance, in which they did not occasionally make their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4590"/>Solitude and silence, however, were more favorable to their appearance than company and conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4591"/>They were more pleased with candle-light than the daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4592"/>They were most numerous, distinct, and active when I was alone and in the dark, especially when my mother had laid me in bed and returned to her own room with the candle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4593"/>At such times, I always expected the company of my aerial visitors, and counted upon it to amuse me till I dropped asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4594"/>Whenever they failed to make their appearance, as was sometimes the case, I felt lonely and discontented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4595"/>I kept up a lively conversation with them,--not by language or by signs, for the attempt on my part to speak or move would at once break the charm and drive them away in a fret, but by a peculiar sort of spiritual intercommunion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4596"/> When their attention was directed towards me, I could feel and respond to all their thoughts and feelings, <pb id="p.425" n="425"/> and was conscious that they could in the same manner feel and respond to mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4597"/>Sometimes they would take no notice of me, but carry on a brisk conversation among themselves, principally by looks and gestures, with now and then an audible word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4598"/>In fact, there were but few with whom I was very familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4599"/>These few were much more constant and uniform in their visits than the great multitude, who were frequently changing, and too much absorbed in their own concerns to think much of me. I scarcely know how I can give an idea of their form and general appearance, for there are no objects in the material world with which I can compare them, and no language adapted to an accurate description of their peculiarities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4600"/>They exhibited all possible combinations of size, shape, proportion, and color, but their most usual appearance was with the human form and proportion, but under a shadowy outline that seemed just ready to melt into the invisible air, and sometimes liable to the most sudden and grotesque changes, and with a uniform darkly bluish color spotted with brown, or brownish white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4601"/>This was the general appearance of the multitude; but there were many exceptions to this description, particularly among my more welcome and familiar visitors, as will be seen in the sequel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4602"/> Besides these rational and generally harmless beings, there was another set of objects which never varied in their form or qualities, and were always mischievous and terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4603"/>The fact of their appearance depended very much on the state of my health and feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4604"/>If I was well and cheerful they seldom troubled me; but when sick or depressed they were sure to obtrude their <pb id="p.426" n="426"/> hateful presence upon me. These were a sort of heavy clouds floating about overhead, of a black color, spotted with brown, in the shape of a very flaring inverted tunnel without a nozzle, and from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> in diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4605"/>They floated from place to place in great numbers, and in all directions, with a strong and steady progress, but with a tremulous, quivering, internal motion that agitated them in every part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4606"/> Whenever they appproached, the rational phantoms were thrown into great consternation; and well it might be, for if a cloud touched any part of <num value="1">one</num> of the rational phantoms it immediately communicated its own color and tremulous motion to the part it touched.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4607"/>In spite of all the efforts and convulsive struggles of the unhappy victim, this color and motion slowly, but steadily and uninteruptedly, proceeded to diffuse itself over every part of the body, and as fast as it did so the body was drawn into the cloud and became a part of its substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4608"/>It was indeed a fearful sight to see the contortions, the agonizing efforts, of the poor creatures who had been touched by <num value="1">one</num> of these awful clouds, and were dissolving and melting into it by inches without the possibility of escape or resistance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4609"/> This was the only visible object that had the least power over the phantoms, and this was evidently composed of the same material as themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4610"/>The forms and actions of all these phantoms varied very much with the state of my health and animal spirits, but I never could discover that the surrounding material objects had any influence upon them, except in this <num value="1">one</num> particular, namely, if I saw them in a neat, well furnished room, there was a neatness and polish in their <pb id="p.427" n="427"/> form and motions; and, on the contrary, if I was in an unfinished, rough apartment, there was a corresponding rudeness and roughness in my serial visitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4611"/>A corresponding difference was visible when I saw them in the woods or in the meadows, upon the water or upon the ground, in the air or among the stars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4612"/>Every different apartment which I occupied had a different set of phantoms, and they always had a degree of correspondence to the circumstances in which they were seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4613"/>(It should be noted, however, that it was not so much the place where the phantoms themselves appeared to me to be, that affected their forms and movements, as the place in which I myself actually was while observing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4614"/>The apparent locality of the phantoms, it is true, had some influence, but my own actual locality had much more.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4615"/>Thus far I have attempted only a general outline of these curious experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4616"/>I will now proceed to a detailed account of several particular incidents, for the sake of illustrating the general statements already made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4617"/>I select a few from manifestations without number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4618"/>I am able to ascertain dates from the following circumstances:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>I was born in <dateStruct value="1802-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct>, and my father died in <dateStruct value="1808-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>, after suffering for more than a year from a lingering organic disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>Between <num value="2">two</num> and <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> before his death he removed from the house in which I was born to another at a little distance from it. What occurred, therefore, before my father's last sickness, must have taken place during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> of my life, and whatever took place before the removal of the family must have taken place during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>Before the removal of the family I slept in a small upper chamber in the front part of the house, where I was generally alone for several hours in the evening and morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>Adjoining this room, and opening into it by a very small door, was a low, dark, narrow, unfinished closet, which was open on the other side into a ruinous, old chaise-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>This closet was a famous place for the gambols of the phantoms, but of their forms and actions I do not now retain any very distinct recollection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>I only remember that I was very careful not to do anything that I thought would be likely to offend them; yet otherwise their presence caused me no uneasiness, and was not at all disagreeable to me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> incident of which I have a distinct recollection was the following:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/><num value="1">One</num> night, as I was lying alone in my chamber with my little dog <persName n="Brutus,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00428.01567" reg="mostcommon:Brutus,nomatch:0"><surname>Brutus</surname></persName> snoring beside my bed, there came out of the closet a very large <name>Indian</name> woman and a very small <name>Indian</name> man, with a huge bass-viol between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>The woman was dressed in a large, loose, black gown, secured around her waist by a belt of the same material, and on her head she wore a high, dark gray fur cap, shaped somewhat like a lady's muff, ornamented with a row of covered buttons in front, and open towards the bottom, showing a red lining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>The man was dressed in a shabby, black-colored overcoat and a little round, black hat that fitted closely to his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>They took no notice of me, but were rather illnatured towards each other, and seemed to be disputing for the possession of the bass-viol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>The man snatched it away and struck upon it a few harsh, hollow notes, <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> which I distinctly heard, and which seemed to vibrate through my whole body, with a strange, stinging sensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>The woman then took it and appeared to play very intently and much to her own satisfaction, but without producing any sound that was perceptible by me. They soon left the chamber, and I saw them go down into the back kitchen, where they sat and played and talked with my mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>It was only when the man took the bow that I could hear the harsh, abrupt, disagreeable sounds of the instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>At length they arose, went out of the back door, and sprang upon a large heap of straw and unthreshed beans, and disappeared with a strange, rumbling sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>This vision was repeated night after night with scarcely any variation while we lived in that house, and once, and once only, after the family had removed to the other house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>The only thing that seemed to me unaccountable and that excited my curiosity was that there should be such a large heap of straw and beans before the door every night, when I could see nothing of it in the daytime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>I frequently crept out of bed and stole softly down into the kitchen, and peeped out of the door to see if it was there very early in the morning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/>I attempted to make some inquiries of my mother, but as I was not as yet very skillful in the use of language, I could get no satisfaction out of her answers, and could see that my questions seemed to distress her. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> she took little notice of what I said, regarding it no doubt as the meaningless prattle of a thoughtless child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4638"/>My persistence, however, seemed to alarm her, and I suppose that she feared for my sanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4639"/>I soon desisted from asking anything further, and shut myself <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> more and more within myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/><num value="1">One</num> night, very soon after the removal, when the house was still, and all the family were in bed, these unearthly musicians once made their appearance in the kitchen of the new house, and after looking around peevishly, and sitting with a discontented frown and in silence, they arose and went out of the back door, and sprang on a pile of cornstalks, and I saw them no more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/> Our new dwelling was a low-studded house of only <num value="1">one</num> story, and, instead of an upper chamber, I now occupied a bedroom that opened into the kitchen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>Within this bedroom, directly on the left hand of the door as you entered from the kitchen, was the staircase which led to the garret; and, as the room was unfinished, some of the boards which inclosed the staircase were too short, and left a considerable space between them and the ceiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/><num value="1">One</num> of these open spaces was directly in front of my bed, so that when I lay upon my pillow my face was opposite to it. Every night, after I had gone to bed and the candle was removed, a very pleasant-looking human face would peer at me over the top of that board, and gradually press forward his head, neck, shoulders, and finally his whole body as far as the waist, through the opening, and then, smiling upon me with great good-nature, would withdraw in the same manner in which he had entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>He was a great favorite of mine; for though we neither of us spoke, we perfectly understood, and were entirely devoted to, each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>It is a singular fact that the features of this favorite phantom bore a very close resemblance to those of a boy older than myself whom I feared and hated: still the resemblance was so strong that I called him by the same name, <persName n="Harvey,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00430.01568" reg="mostcommon:Harvey,nomatch:0"><surname>Harvey</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/><pb id="p.431" n="431"/></p> 
<p> <persName n="Harvey,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00431.01569" reg="mostcommon:Harvey,nomatch:0"><surname>Harvey</surname></persName>'s visits were always expected and always pleasant; but sometimes there were visitations of another sort, odious and frightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4647"/><num value="1">One</num> of these I will relate as a specimen of the rest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4648"/> <num value="1">One</num> night, after I had retired to bed and was looking for <persName n="Harvey,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00431.01570" reg="mostcommon:Harvey,nomatch:0"><surname>Harvey</surname></persName>, I observed an unusual number of the tunnel-shaped tremulous clouds already described, and they seemed intensely black and strongly agitated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4649"/>This alarmed me exceedingly, and I had a terrible feeling that something awful was going to happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4650"/>It was not long before I saw <persName n="Harvey,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00431.01571" reg="mostcommon:Harvey,nomatch:0"><surname>Harvey</surname></persName> at his accustomed place, cautiously peeping at me through the aperture, with an expression of pain and terror on his countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4651"/>He seemed to warn me to be on my guard, but was afraid to put his head into the room lest he should be touched by <num value="1">one</num> of the clouds, which were every moment growing thicker and more numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/><persName n="Harvey,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00431.01572" reg="mostcommon:Harvey,nomatch:0"><surname>Harvey</surname></persName> soon withdrew and left me alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4653"/>On turning my eyes towards the left-hand wall of the room, I thought I saw at an immense distance below me the regions of the damned, as I had heard them pictured in sermons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>From this awful world of horror the tunnel-shaped clouds were ascending, and I perceived that they were the principal instruments of torture in these gloomy abodes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4655"/>These regions were at such an immense distance below me that I could obtain but a very indistinct view of the inhabitants, who were very numerous and exceedingly active.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>Near the surface of the earth, and as it seemed to me but a little distance from my bed, I saw <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> sturdy, resolute devils endeavoring to carry off an unprincipled and dissipated man in the neighborhood, by the name of <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00431.01573" reg="nearbymention:Brown,C.,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>, of whom I had stood in terror <pb id="p.432" n="432"/> for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4657"/>These devils I saw were very different from the common representations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4658"/>They had neither red faces, nor horns, nor hoofs, nor tails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4659"/>They were in all respects stoutly built and well-dressed gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4660"/>The only peculiarity that I noted in their appearance was as to their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4661"/>Their faces and necks were perfectly bare, without hair or flesh, and of a uniform sky-blue color, like the ashes of burnt paper before it falls to pieces, and of a certain glossy smoothness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4662"/> As I looked on, full of eagerness, the devils struggled to force <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00432.01574" reg="nearbymention:Brown,C.,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName> down with them, and <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00432.01575" reg="nearbymention:Brown,C.,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName> struggled with the energy of desperation to save himself from their grip, and it seemed that the human was likely to prove too strong for the infernal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4663"/>In this emergency <num value="1">one</num> of the devils, panting for breath and covered with perspiration, beckoned to a strong, thick cloud that seemed to understand him perfectly, and, whirling up to <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00432.01576" reg="nearbymention:Brown,C.,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>, touched his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4664"/><persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00432.01577" reg="nearbymention:Brown,C.,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName> resisted stoutly, and struck out right and left at the cloud most furiously, but the usual effect was produced,the hand grew black, quivered, and seemed to be melting into the cloud; then the arm, by slow degrees, and then the head and shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4665"/>At this instant <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00432.01578" reg="nearbymention:Brown,C.,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>, collecting all his energies for <num value="1">one</num> desperate effort, sprang at once into the centre of the cloud, tore it asunder, and descended to the ground, exclaiming, with a hoarse, furious voice that grated on my ear, <quote> There, I've got out; dam'me if I have n't!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4666"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> word that had been spoken through the whole horrible scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4667"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I had ever seen a cloud fail to produce its appropriate result, and it terrified me so that I trembled from head to foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4668"/>The <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> devils, however, did not seem to be in the least discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4669"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, who seemed to be the leader, went away and quickly returned bringing with him an enormous pair of rollers fixed in an <rs n="iron frame" type="product">iron frame</rs>, such as are used in iron-mills for the purpose of rolling out and slitting bars of iron, except instead of being turned by machinery, each roller was turned by an immense crank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/><num value="3">Three</num> of the devils now seized <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00433.01579" reg="nearbymention:Brown,C.,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName> and put his feet to the rollers, while <num value="2">two</num> others stood, <num value="1">one</num> at each crank, and began to roll him in with a steady strain that was entirely irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>Not a word was spoken, not a sound was heard; but the fearful struggles and terrified, agonizing looks of Browir were more than I could endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>I sprang from my bed and ran through the kitchen into the room where my parents slept, and entreated that they would permit me to spend the remainder of the night with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>After considerable parleying they assured me that nothing could hurt me, and advised me to go back to bed. I replied that I was not afraid of their hurting me, but I could n't bear to see them acting so with <persName n="Brown,,C.,,," id="n0181.0022.00433.01580" reg="expanded:Brown,Clarissa,,,"><foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>. <quote> Poh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>poh! you foolish boy,</quote> replied my father, sternly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/><quote> You've only been dreaming; go right back to bed, or I shall have to whip you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>Knowing that there was no other alternative, I trudged back through the kitchen with all the courage I could muster, cautiously entered my room, where I found everything quiet, there being neither cloud, nor devil, nor anything of the kind to be seen, and getting into bed I slept quietly till morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>The next day I was rather sad and melancholy, but kept all my troubles to myself, through fear of <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00433.01581" reg="nearbymention:Brown,C.,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>This happened before my father's sickness, <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> and consequently between the <num value="4">four</num> and <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> of my age.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/> During my father's sickness and after his death I lived with my grandmother; and when I had removed to her house I forever lost sight of <persName n="Harvey,,,,," id="n0181.0022.00434.01582" reg="mostcommon:Harvey,nomatch:0"><surname>Harvey</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>I still continued to sleep alone for the most part, but in a neatly furnished upper chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>Across the corner of the chamber, opposite to and at a little distance from the head of my bed, there was a closet in the form of an old-fashioned buffet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>After going to bed, on looking at the door of this closet, I could see at a great distance from it a pleasant meadow, terminated by a beautiful little grove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>Out of this grove, and across this meadow, a charming little female figure would advance, about <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> high and exquisitely proportioned, dressed in a loose black <rs n="silk robe" type="product">silk robe</rs>, with long, smooth black hair parted up her head and hanging loose over her shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>She would come forward with a slow and regular step, becoming more distinctly visible as she approached nearer, till she came even with the surface of the closet door, when she would smile upon me, raise her hands to her head and draw them down on each side of her face, suddenly turn round, and go off at a rapid trot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>The moment she turned I could see a good-looking mulatto man, rather smaller than herself, following directly in her wake and trotting off after her. This was generally repeated <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times before I went to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>The features of the mulatto bore some resemblance to those of the <rs>Indian</rs> man with the bass-viol, but were much more mild and agreeable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/><gap/> </p> 
<p>I awoke <num value="1">one</num> bright, moonlight night, and found a <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> large, full-length human skeleton of an ashy-blue color in bed with me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>I screamed out with fright, and soon summoned the family around me. I refused to tell the cause of my alarm, but begged permission to occupy another bed, which was granted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/> For the remainder of the night I slept but little; but I saw upon the window-stools companies of little fairies, about <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> high, in white robes, gamboling and dancing with incessant merriment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/><num value="2">Two</num> of them, a male and female, rather taller than the rest, were dignified with a crown and sceptre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>They took the kindest notice of me, smiled upon me with great benignity, and seemed to assure me of their protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>I was soothed and cheered by their presence, though after all there was a sort of sinister and selfish expression in their countenances which prevented my placing implicit confidence in them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/> Up to this time I had never doubted the real existence of these phantoms, nor had I ever suspected that other people had not seen them as distinctly as myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>I now, however, began to discover with no little anxiety that my friends had little or no knowledge of the serial beings among whom I have spent my whole life; that my allusions to them were not understood, and all complaints respecting them were laughed at. I had never been disposed to say much about them, and this discovery confirmed me in my silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>It did not, however, affect my own belief, or lead me to suspect that my imaginations were not realities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/> During the whole of this period I took great pleasure in walking out alone, particularly in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>The most lonely fields, the woods, and the banks of the <pb id="p.436" n="436"/> river, and other places most completely secluded, were my favorite resorts, for there I could enjoy the sight of innumerable aerial beings of all sorts, without interruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>Every object, even every shaking leaf, seemed to me to be animated by some living soul, whose nature in some degree corresponded to its habitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>I spent much of my life in these solitary rambles; there were particular places to which I gave names, and visited them at regular intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>Moonlight was particularly agreeable to me, but most of all I enjoyed a thick, foggy night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>At times, during these walks, I would be excessively oppressed by an indefinite and deep feeling of melancholy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>Without knowing why, I would be so unhappy as to wish myself annihilated, and suddenly it would occur to me that my friends at home were suffering some dreadful calamity, and so vivid would be the impression, that I would hasten home with all speed to see what had taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>At such seasons I felt a morbid love for my friends that would almost burn up my soul, and yet, at the least provocation from them, I would fly into an uncontrollable passion and foam like a little fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>I was called a dreadful-tempered boy; but the <rs>Lord</rs> knows that I never occasioned pain to any animal, whether human or brutal, without suffering untold agonies in consequence of it. I cannot, even now, without feelings of deep sorrow, call to mind the alternate fits of corroding melancholy, irritation, and bitter remorse which I then endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>My dear friend,--I value very highly the warrant to call you friend which your letter has given me. It lay awaiting me on our return the other night from a <measure n="9weeks" type="date">nine weeks</measure> absence in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, and it made me almost wish that you could have a momentary vision of the discouragement,--nay, paralyzing despondency &mdash; in which many days of my writing life have been passed, in order that you might fully understand the good I find in such sympathy as yours, in such an assurance as you give me that my work has been worth doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>But I will not dwell on any mental sickness of mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>The best joy your words give me is the sense of that sweet, generous feeling in you which dictated them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>I shall always be the richer because you have in this way made me know you better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>I must tell you that my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glimpse of you as a woman came through a letter of yours, and charmed me very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>The letter was addressed to <persName n="Follen,Mrs.,,,," id="n0181.0024.00460.01714" reg="mostcommon:Follen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Follen</surname></persName>, and <num value="1">one</num> morning I called on her in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> (how many years ago!); she was kind enough to read it to me, because it contained a little <pb id="p.461" n="461"/> history of your life, and a sketch of your domestic circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>I remember thinking that it was very kind of you to write that long letter, in reply to inquiries of <num value="1">one</num> who was personally unknown to you; and, looking back with my present experience, I think it was kinder than it then appeared, for at that time you must have been much oppressed with the immediate results of your fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>I remember, too, that you wrote of your husband as <num value="1">one</num> who was richer in Hebrew and <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> than in pounds or shillings; and as an ardent scholar has always been a character of peculiar interest to me, I have rarely had your image in my mind without the accompanying image (more or less erroneous) of such a scholar by your side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>I shall welcome the fruit of his <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0181.0024.00461.01715" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName> studies, whenever it comes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>I have good hopes that your fears are groundless as to the obstacles your new book (<title><placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Oldtown</placeName> folks</title> ) may find here from its thorough American character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>Most readers who are likely to be really influenced by writing above the common order will find that special aspect an added reason for interest and study; and I dare say you have long seen, as I am beginning to see with new clearness, that if a book which has any sort of exquisiteness happens also to be a popular, widely circulated book, the power over the social mind for any good is, after all, due to its reception by a few appreciative natures, and is the slow result of radiation from that narrow circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>I mean that you can affect a few souls, and that each of these in turn may affect a few more, but that no exquisite book tells properly and directly on a multitude, however largely it may be spread by type and paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>Witness the things the multitude will say about <pb id="p.462" n="462"/> it, if <num value="1">one</num> is so unhappy as to be obliged to hear their sayings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>I do not write this cynically, but in pure sadness and pity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>Both traveling abroad and staying at home among our <name>English</name> sights and sports, <num value="1">one</num> must continually feel how slowly the centuries work toward the moral good of men, and that thought lies very close to what you say as to your wonder or conjecture concerning my religious point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>I believe that religion, too, has to be modified according to the dominant phases; that a religion more perfect than any yet prevalent must express less care of personal consolation, and the more deeply awing sense of responsibility to man springing from sympathy with that which of all things is most certainly known to us,--the difficulty of the human lot. Letters are necessarily narrow and fragmentary, and when <num value="1">one</num> writes on wide subjects, are likely to create more misunderstanding than illumination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>But I have little anxiety in writing to you,.dear friend and fellow-laborer; for you have had longer experience than I as a writer, and fuller experience as a woman, since you have borne children and known a mother's history from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>I trust your quick and long-taught mind as an interpreter little liable to mistake me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>When you say, <quote>We live in an orange grove, and are planting many more,</quote> and when I think you must have abundant family love to cheer you, it seems to me that you must have a paradise about you. But no list of circumstances will make a paradise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>Nevertheless, I must believe that the joyous, tender humor of your books clings about your more immediate life, and makes some of that sunshine for yourself which you <pb id="p.463" n="463"/> have given to us. I see the advertisement of <title><placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Oldtown</placeName> folks</title>,.and shall eagerly expect it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>Years ago, in <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>, I visited <persName n="Owen,Mister,,,," id="n0181.0024.00464.01722" reg="nearbymention:Owen,Robert,Dale,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Owen</surname></persName> for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, and found him directing his attention to the phenomena of spiritism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>He had stumbled upon some singular instances of it accidentally, and he had forthwith instituted a series of researches and experiments on the subject, some of which he showed me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>The result at the time was sufficiently curious, but I was interested in his account of the manner in which he proceeded, keeping records of every experiment with its results, in classified orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>As the result of his studies and observations, he has published <num value="2">two</num> books, <num value="1">one</num> <quote>Footfalls on the <name>Boundary</name> of another world,</quote> published in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, and latterly, <quote>The Debatable Land Between this World and the <name>Next</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>To me they present a great deal that is intensely curious and interesting, although I do not admit, of course, all his deductions, and think he often takes too much for granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>Still, with every abatement there remains a residuum of fact, which I think both curious and useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>We began to live here, and gradually we improved the hut by lath, plaster, and paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>Ours had to be built around the trunk of the tree, so that our cottage has a peculiar and original air, and seems as if it were half tree, or a something that had grown out of the tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>We added on parts, and have thrown out gables and chambers, as a tree throws out new branches, till our cottage is like nobody else's, and yet we settle into it with real enjoyment.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/> There are those who would have us think that in <hi rend="italics">our</hi> day this doom is reversed; that there are those who have the power to restore to us the communion of our lost ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>How many a heart, wrung and tortured with the anguish of this fearful silence, has throbbed with strange, vague hopes at the suggestion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>When we hear sometimes of persons of the strongest and clearest minds becoming credulous votaries of certain spiritualist circles, let us not wonder: if we inquire, we shall <pb id="p.485" n="485"/> almost always find that the belief has followed some stroke of death; it is only an indication of the desperation of that heart-hunger which in part it appeases.</p>
