<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>He had long ago participated in the work in haying time himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The hours of work were governed by the moon's changes, and every householder and farmer had to consult the <q direct="unspecified">tide table</q> in the <q direct="unspecified">Farmer's Almanac.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Much of the grass after cutting had to be <q direct="unspecified">poled off</q> to the higher land for curing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>As the marsh was intersected by ditches for more ready drainage, these were a pitfall, especially for the rear man who could not well see the way, because of the pile of grass before him, and unless warned by the <num value="1">one</num> ahead, would suddenly find himself in the hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>On these the hay was stacked and removed when the ground had frozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>If horses were used on the marshes, they were provided with oak boards about a foot square, which were fastened under each hoof by an iron clamp, and prevented sinking into the soft marsh mud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>This, accompanied by an extreme high course of the tide, which backed up the salt water into the pond, caused the ebb tide to carry with it a large amount of filthy water into the river.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>After viewing the condition of things at the upper end of the pond, the company proceeded to the lower end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>The chairman agreed such to be a sensible view of the subject, and we heard no more in regard to section <num value="2">two</num> of the act.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>While the act was before the committee an effort was made by some of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>'s citizens advocating the establishment of the filter bed in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 5" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>'s territory, but the committee agreed that as no part of the sewage came from <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 5" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> that the filter beds should <hi rend="italics">not</hi> be located there, and they were located beside the railroad just beyond the town line in <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and set in operation after a time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The employees of the city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> who had charge of the operation of these filter beds allowed a considerable amount of the sewage matter to flow into the pond without being purified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>At a hearing before a <orgName n="Legislative Committee" type="committee">legislative committee</orgName>, the selectmen having complained were requested to furnish a sample of what was claimed to be unpurified sewage, to be presented to the committee at a subsequent meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>Accordingly a sample was taken from the mouth of the sewer <hi rend="italics">where it fell into the <q direct="unspecified">open ditch.</q></hi> As several days elapsed before the committee met again, the sample had a good chance to ripen before its presentation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>An examination of the same proved without any question that it had <hi rend="italics">never passed through the filter beds</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>While viewing the situation at the lower end of the upper pond the <hi rend="italics">employees</hi> of the water board <hi rend="italics">denied</hi> that any sewage was allowed to enter the pond without passing through the filter beds, saying that <q direct="unspecified">engines pumping sewage into the filter beds were running night and day.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>When it was proposed to visit the filter beds at the upper end of the pond, these employees took a team and drove rapidly <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> away toward the pumping station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Suspecting that they were going to start up the pumping engine, some of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 5" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>'s people started in pursuit and arrived at the station before the engine could be started up.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>After the arrival of the party, which had <hi rend="italics">walked</hi> to the pumping station, the mayor was informed of the action of the employees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>He was asked if it was his intent that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the sewage should be passed through the filter beds, and he answered <q direct="unspecified">yes.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Turning to the city engineer, the mayor said, <q direct="unspecified">How would that do, <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>&mdash;&mdash;?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/><q direct="unspecified">It would not do at all,</q> was the answer.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> never did, and never intended to purify all the sewage before discharging it into the pond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The governor's bark, etc., etc.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Now as we look at it, the governor's bark (the <hi rend="italics">Blessing</hi>) was built just where the governor wrote that it was, at <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Mistick">Mistick</placeName>,</q> the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Ten Hills Farm">Ten Hills Farm</placeName></q> in <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> (present <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName>), and not in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 5" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> at all.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Now, while tradition has been said to be an unsafe guide, it may be well to look into this a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>It occurs to me that it is timely to try to answer some of the questions asked in the article, and perhaps to criticize some of the statements and conclusions of the author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>I agree with <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0021.00071.00322" reg="mostcommon:Brooks,Peter,C.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> that in all probability the <rs type="place">Wade mill</rs> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> erected within <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 5" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>The <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court</orgName> granted the petition, but it is evident that no action was taken by the town to build a mill, as the records fail to show that the town ever voted to build, or to appropriate any money therefor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>In regard to the query about <placeName reg="Mistick bridge">Mistick bridge</placeName>, I answer that the term <placeName reg="Mistick bridge">Mistick bridge</placeName> meant the bridge located where the <rs type="place">Cradock bridge</rs> now stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>There was no other bridge across the river at that date (<dateStruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></dateStruct>).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>It is doubtful if at that time the term <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Wear bridge">Wear bridge</placeName>,</q> was in use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>Note the wide expanse of land between the road and the river, without any road or building intervening.
