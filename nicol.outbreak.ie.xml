<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>Upon urgent and repeated request from the publishers, the author consented to lay aside temporarily a larger and more important literary task, to write for them this initial volume of the <title>Campaigns of the civil War.</title> Personal observation and long previous investigation had furnished him a great variety of new material for the work; and this was opportunely supplemented by the recent publication of the <rs>Official War Records</rs> for <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, both Union and Confederate, opening to comparison and use an immense mass of historical data, and furnishing the definite means of verifying or correcting the statements of previous writers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Under these advantages the author has written the present volume, basing his work on materials of unquestioned authenticity-books, documents, and manuscripts-and, indeed, for the greater part, on official public records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>His effort has been a conscientious and painstaking <num value="1">one</num>, making historical accuracy his constant aim. If, unfortunately, he has committed any errors, he hopes they may prove only <pb id="p.xviii" n="xviii"/> such as from the meagreness or conflicting nature of the evidence any <num value="1">one</num> might fall into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>He would gladly have appended to his pages full references and citations, but want of space absolutely forbade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>So many kind friends have encouraged and aided him, that he finds it impossible to acknowledge their services in detail, and therefore takes this occasion to return to <num value="1">one</num> and all his sincere thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Government officials, especially, of all grades, have with uniform courtesy afforded him every facility in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Without free access to the various departments and archives-and, above all, to the vast historical treasures of the <name>Library</name> of Congress &mdash; it would have been exceedingly difficult to gather and verify the numerous facts, quotations, names, and dates, which his narrative required. </p>

<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="1" n="I"><num value="1">1</num></num>: secession.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The <dateStruct value="1860-10-5"><day reg="5">fifth</day> day of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year>1860</year>,</dateStruct> is the initial point of the <rs>American Rebellion</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Its conception, animus, and probably its plans, lay much farther back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It had been seriously proposed once or twice before, but it was then that its formal organization was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>On that day <persName n="Gist,Governor,,,," id="n0030.0002.00001.00001" reg="mostcommon:Gist,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Gist</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, wrote a confidential circular letter, which he despatched by the hand of a special messenger, to the governors of what were commonly designated the <rs>Cotton States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In this letter he asked an interchange of opinions which he might be at liberty to submit to a consultation of leading men of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He said <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> would unquestionably call a convention as soon as it was ascertained that a majority of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0030.0002.00001.00002" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> electors were chosen in the then pending presidential election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><quote>If a single State secedes,</quote> he said, <quote>she will follow her. If no other State takes the lead, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> will secede (in my opinion) alone, if she has any assurance that she will be soon followed by another or other States; otherwise it is doubtful.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He asked information, and advised concerted action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to respond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The people would <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> not, so wrote the governor under date of <dateStruct value="-10-18"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="18">18th</day></dateStruct>, consider <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0030.0002.00002.00003" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election a sufficient cause for disunion, and the <name>Legislature</name> would probably not call a convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The Governor of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, under date of <dateStruct value="-10-25"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="25">25th</day></dateStruct>, thought <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> would not secede alone, but would secede in cooperation with <num value="2">two</num> or more States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The Governor of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, under date of <dateStruct value="-10-26"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="26">26th</day></dateStruct>, wrote: <quote>If any State moves, I think <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> will go with her.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>On the same day the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> answered: <quote>I shall not advise the secession of my State, and I will add that I do not think the people of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> will ultimately decide in favor of that course.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The Governor of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, under date of <dateStruct value="-10-31"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="31">31st</day></dateStruct>, advocated retaliatory legislation, and ventured his opinion that the people of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> would wait for some overt act. <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> alone responded with anything like enthusiasm, but only after the lapse of a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Her governor said that <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> was <quote>ready to wheel into line with the gallant <rs>Palmetto State</rs>, or any other Cotton State or States,</quote> and thought she would unquestionably call a convention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The discouraging tone of these answers establishes, beyond controversy, that, excepting in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, the rebellion was not in any sense a popular revolution, but was a conspiracy among the prominent local office-holders and politicians, which the people neither expected nor desired, and which they were made eventually to justify and uphold by the usual arts and expedients of conspiracy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Directly and indirectly, the <rs>South</rs> had practically controlled the government during its whole existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Excited to ambition by this success, she sought to perpetuate that control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The extension of slavery and the creation of additional Slave States was a necessary step in the scheme, and became the well-defined single issue in the presidential election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But in this contest the <rs>South</rs> for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time me: <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> overwhelming defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The choice of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0030.0002.00003.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was a conclusive and final decision, in legal form and by constitutional majorities, that slavery should not be extended; and the popular vote of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> transferred the balance of power irrevocably to the <rs>Free States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In the political discussions throughout this presidential campaign, as well as in preceding years, the <rs>South</rs> had made free and loud use of <num value="2">two</num> leading arguments, always with telling effect: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to intimidate the <rs>North</rs>, was the threat of disunion; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to <quote>fire the <rs>Southern</rs> heart,</quote> was the entirely unfounded alarm-cry that the <rs>North</rs>, if successful, would not merely exclude slavery from federal territories, but would also destroy slavery in the <rs>Slave States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The unthinking masses of the <rs>South</rs> accepted both these arguments in their literal sense; and Southern public opinion, excited and suspicious, became congenial soil in which the intended revolt easily took root. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, in addition, had been little else than a school of treason for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>. She was, moreover, peculiarly adapted to become the hotbed of conspiracy by the fact that of all the <name>States</name> she was least republican in both the character of her people and the form of her institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>She was exclusive, aristocratic, reactionary; had a narrow distrust of popular participation in government, and longed for the distinctions of caste and privilege in society. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It would seem that, before the governors' replies were all received, the consultation or caucus for which they were solicited was held, and the programme of insurrection agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Circumstances rendered a special session of the <orgName n="South Carolina Legislature" type="legislature">South Carolina Legislature</orgName> necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The election was held during the month of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Local fanaticism tolerated no opposition party in the <rs>State</rs>, and under the manipulation <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> of the conspirators the prevailing question was, who was the most zealous <quote>resistance</quote> candidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>To a legislature elected from this kind of material, <persName n="Gist,Governor,,,," id="n0030.0002.00004.00005" reg="mostcommon:Gist,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Gist</surname></persName>, on <dateStruct value="-11-5"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="5">5th</day></dateStruct>, sent a defiant, revolutionary message-the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> official notice and proclamation of insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He declared that <quote>our institutions</quote> were in danger from the hostility of the <quote>fixed majorities</quote> of the <rs>North</rs>; and recommended the calling of a <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State convention</orgName>, and the purchase of arms and material of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A lingering doubt about the result of the presidential contest appears in the formal choice by the <name>Legislature</name>, of electors who would vote for <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n0030.0002.00004.00006" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,John,C.,,:1"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0030.0002.00004.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But that doubt was short-lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The morning of <dateStruct value="-11-7"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="7">7th</day></dateStruct> brought the certain news of the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0030.0002.00004.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hamlin,,,,," id="n0030.0002.00004.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hamlin,Hannibal,,,:2"><surname>Hamlin</surname></persName> on the previous day, and the rejoicings which would have been uttered over their defeat became jubilations that their success offered the long-coveted pretext for disunion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>From this time forth everything was managed to swell the revolutionary furor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The Legislature immediately ordered a convention, made appropriations, passed military bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <orgName n="Federal office" type="office">federal office</orgName>-holders, with much public flourish of their patriotic sacrifice, resigned their offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Military companies enrolled themselves in the city; organizations of minutemen sprang up in the rural neighborhoods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Drills, parades, meetings, bonfires, secession harangues, secession cockades, palmetto flags, purchase of fire-arms and powder, singing of the <name>Marseillaise</name> &mdash; there is not room to enumerate the follies to which the general populace, especially of <placeName key="tgn,7013583;tgn,7013582;tgn,7013580;tgn,2233249;tgn,2233245;tgn,2233230" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013583;charleston, kanawha, west virginia,Kanawha,West Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013582;charleston, charleston, south carolina,Charleston,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013580;charleston, coles, illinois,Coles,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2233249;charleston island, perry, ohio,Perry,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2233245;charleston harbor, charleston, south carolina,Charleston,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2233230;charleston, montgomery, new york,Montgomery,New York,United States,North and Central America" reg="charleston, kanawha, west virginia,Kanawha,West Virginia,United States,North and Central America;charleston, charleston, south carolina,Charleston,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;charleston, coles, illinois,Coles,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;charleston island, perry, ohio,Perry,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;charleston harbor, charleston, south carolina,Charleston,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;charleston, montgomery, new york,Montgomery,New York,United States,North and Central America">Charleston</placeName>, devoted their days and nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Certain features of the struggle deserve special explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The <quote>irrepressible conflict</quote> between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, between freedom and slavery, was not confined to the <num value="2">two</num> sides of <placeName reg="Mason, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063592">Mason</placeName> and <placeName reg="Dixon, Lee, Illinois" key="tgn,2027503">Dixon</placeName>'s line; it found a certain expression even in the <rs>Cotton States</rs> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Most of these States embrace territory of a radically different quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Their southern and sea-coast front is a broad belt of seaislands, marshes, river-swamps, and low alluvial lands, exceedingly unhealthy from malarial fevers in the hot season, but of unsurpassed fertility, and possessing the picturesque aspects of an exuberant half-tropical vegetation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>This is the region of the great cotton, rice, and sugar plantations which have made the <rs>South</rs> rich and famous; here the <rs>St. Clairs</rs> and <rs>Legrees</rs> of real life counted their slaves by hundreds, and aspired to sybaritic lives in ample, hospitable mansions, surrounded by magnificent and venerable live-oak and magnolia groves, avenues of stately palms, princely gardens of native and exotic bloom, and illimitable hedge-lines of the <rs>Cherokee</rs> rose; a swarm of house-servants to minister to pampered indolence and dispense a lavish hospitality; a troop of field-hands to fill the cotton, rice, or sugar houses; a blending of Arcadian simplicity and feudal pretension; every plantation with its indulgent master, its exacting overseer, its submissive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>These were the lights of the picture; abler pens have painted the horrible background of bloody slave-whips, barbarous slave-codes, degrading slave-auctions, yellow fever, cypress-swamps, the bloodhound hunt, and the ever-present dread of servile insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The northern half of the <rs>Cotton States</rs> was very different; here were thin, sandy uplands of meagre productiveness; monotonous forests of pine and scrub-oak, running again into the more varied and romantic scenery of the subsiding spurs of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>; blue crags, bright streams, shining waterfalls, and the changing, deciduous foliage of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Great slave-plantations could not flourish here; white population predominated; agriculture was varied; the husbandman had a sterner struggle with nature; and communities were burdened with all the economic and social detriments of the slave system, having none of its delights. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>A dense slave population and ultra secessionism were, therefore, the rule in the southern, and white majorities and union feeling in the northern districts of the <rs>Cotton States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Therefore, also, political power lay in the slave region, which again was allied to the commercial interests clustering about southern seaports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>All the leverage was in the hands of treason-offices, ostracism, advantage in representation, commercial ambition, party ascendancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The wonder is, not that secession succeeded in the struggle, but that there was any serious contest at all. With all this, there is strong ground for belief that insurrection gained its ends at last only through chicane, deceit, and fraud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>What is a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times more astounding, however, is that, on their part, the commissioners were too stupid to perceive the vast advantage of this concession and offer.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Such action had been arranged and agreed upon from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The congressional manifesto from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 9" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, as far back as <dateStruct value="-12-14"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="14">14th</day></dateStruct>, advised that <quote>we are satisfied the honor, safety, and independence of the <rs>Southern</rs> people require the organization of a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern confederacy</orgName>--a result to be obtained only by separate State secession.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>This agreement of the <rs>Washington</rs> caucus was steadily adhered to. The specious argument invented in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, that <quote>we can make better terms outside of the <rs>Union</rs> than in it,</quote> and the public declaration of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>'s commissioner in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, that secession <quote>was not taken with the view of breaking up the present government, but to assure to her (<placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>) those guarantees and principles of liberty which had been pledged to her by the fathers of the <name>Revolution</name>,</quote> were but tricks of the conspiracy for local use and effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The managers well understood that if the <name>States</name> were once committed to secession, the mere revolutionary momentum of the crisis would carry them to whatever combination they might devise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/><pb id="p.40" n="40"/> </p> 
<p>The whole plan appears to have been more fully matured and adopted in a Washington caucus held on the night of <dateStruct value="1861-01-05"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="5">5</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, at which time <num value="4">four</num> important points were arranged: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, the <rs>Cotton States</rs> should immediately secede; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, that delegates should be chosen to meet in <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, <quote>to organize a confederacy,</quote> not later than <dateStruct value="-02-15"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="15">15th</day></dateStruct>; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, that the conspirators would remain in Congress as long as possible, to obstruct coercive legislation; and <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, that <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0030.0004.00040.00187" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Slidell,,,,," id="n0030.0004.00040.00188" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Mallory,,,,," id="n0030.0004.00040.00189" reg="mostcommon:Mallory,nomatch:0"><surname>Mallory</surname></persName> be appointed a committee to carry out the objects of the caucus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Thus, more than a month before his inauguration as rebel president, the leader of the conspiracy was entrusted with the supervision and management of the plot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The caucus programme was executed with but slight deviation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The States seceded, appointed delegates to <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0030.0004.00040.00190" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,William,R.,,:1"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, and the conspirators withdrew from Congress at the last moment to assume the more active control of the rebellion in their respective States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>As events progressed it became evident to the leaders that it was important to complete their new government before the expiration of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0030.0004.00040.00191" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>They understood perfectly his temper and purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Though he denied them the treasonable complicity they had hoped and asked, and discontinued the important concessions with which he began, he still stood committed to non-coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>What his successor might decide was uncertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Repeated efforts had been made to draw from <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0030.0004.00040.00192" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> some expression of his intention --some forecast of his policy, but they had been uniformly unsuccessful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Accordingly the secession delegates met in <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> on <dateStruct value="-02-4"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="4">4th</day></dateStruct>, instead of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>, as had been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arranged, and organized a <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">provisional Congress</orgName>, and a few days thereafter (<dateStruct value="1861-02-08"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="8">8</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>) adopted a provisional <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> government, to be known as <quote>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>There was little difficulty in arriving at this result; most if not all the seceders' State conventions had declared a wish that their proposed new government should be modelled on that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>From this they proceeded to the work of framing a permanent constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>This was a somewhat slower process, though it was also completed and adopted by the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">provisional Congress</orgName> on <dateStruct value="1861-03-11"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="11">11</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Few changes from the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The new constitution professed to be established by <quote>each State acting in its sovereign and independent character,</quote> instead of simply by <quote>We the people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It provided that in newly acquired territory <quote>the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, shall be recognized and protected by Congress and by the <rs>Territorial Government</rs></quote> ; also for the right of transit and sojourn for <quote>slaves and other property,</quote> and the right to reclaim <quote>slaves and other persons</quote> to service or labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>It did not, as consistency required, provide for the right of secession or deny the right of coercion; on the contrary all its implications were against the former and in favor of the latter, for it declared itself to be the supreme law of the land, binding on the judges in every State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>It provided for the punishment of treason; and declared that no State should enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation, grant letters of marque and reprisal, coin money, lay duties, keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, make any compact with another State or with a foreign power &mdash; a sweeping practical negation of the whole heretical dogma of State supremacy upon which they had built their revolt. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/></p> 
<p>If the remotest doubt remained, from previous indications and this official hint, that the whole purpose and animus of the revolt was the establishment of a powerful slaveocracy, that doubt was removed by the public declaration of <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n0030.0004.00042.00203" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, the new <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs>.

<p>The prevailing ideas entertained by him (<persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0030.0004.00042.00204" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>) and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the <name>African</name> was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of that day was, that somehow or other, in the order of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> the institution would be evanescent and <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> pass away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>This idea, though not incorporated in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, was the prevailing idea at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The Constitution it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> collateral questions connected themselves with the main <num value="1">one</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Another secondary consideration was the attitude of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 13" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Their loyalty, however, was of a qualified sort, deeply tinctured with <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> factional prejudice, and irritated with the imaginary wrongs of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Upon this element, rebel intrigue and conspiracy were working with telling effect; and instead of declaring and practising frank and direct adherence to the <rs>Government</rs>, the union members were fulminating baseless complaints, demanding impossible guarantees, and pleading indulgent excuses for the course of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the <rs>Cotton Republics</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>And this condition of misdirected and unstable loyalty was also wide-spread among the leaders and people of the <rs>Border States</rs> of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The rebels had built their siege-works on the approaching points of the islands forming the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The garrison of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, notwithstanding its tedious confinement, was in excellent spirit, and, since the long apprehended contest had finally come, was quite ready to make a manful resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Even the <num value="43">forty-three</num> non-combatant workmen caught the impulse of fight and freely volunteered their help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>The needful preparations had been already made, and since the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> every <num value="1">one</num> had by order changed his quarters into the gun casemates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Here they were securely housed when at <time value="4:30am">4.30 A. M.</time> the rebel cannonade began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>It was not yet daylight, and for some hours the fort made no reply, but lay in the morning twilight as silent and apparently as unconcerned as if it were tenantless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The rations had already become uncomfortably short; the last barrel of flour was issued <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> before, and now there was little left to subsist upon except pork and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>On this mainly the command made a breakfast, and at about <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> <persName n="Doubleday,Captain,Abner,,," id="n0030.0006.00064.00311" reg="default:Doubleday,Abner,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Abner</foreName> <surname>Doubleday</surname></persName> fired the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun from the fort at an iron-clad battery on <placeName key="tgn,2271638" n="1.000 4" reg="cummings point, charleston, south carolina">Cumming's Point</placeName>. <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> Reliefs were stationed at other guns, and soon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> was sending back a spirited reply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>The <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> of unopposed bombardment from the rebel batteries had by this time already determined <num value="1">one</num> important phase of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Carefully watching the effect of the enemy's cannonade, it was apparent, without further question, that under the concentrated missiles of their guns, and particularly because of the precision of their vertical fire, it would be folly to expose the gunners on the rampart or the open parade of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Had <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> contained a full war garrison, new men could have replaced those killed or disabled; but, with his slender force, <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0030.0006.00065.00312" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Robert,,,:2"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName> decided that he could not afford this risk, and therefore at once ordered an abandonment of all the barbette guns and a few mounted on the parade to throw shells, restricting the men rigidly to the casemates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Thus at <num value="1">one</num> swoop his fighting armament was reduced more than <num value="0.5">one-half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>This, however, was not the worst; it practically annihilated the offensive strength of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Of the <num value="21">twenty-one</num> casemate guns but <num value="4">four</num> were <num value="40">forty</num>two pounders, the rest only <num value="30">thirty</num>-twos, a weight of metal of little avail against the enemy's strong earthworks and iron roofs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>In this way the cannonade went actively on during the forenoon of <dateStruct value="-04-12"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="12">12th</day></dateStruct>, without much damage or effect, except upon the buildings in both <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName>, ordinarily occupied as barracks and quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> suffered most in this respect: the balls striking the face of its walls merely buried themselves in the brick-work, without passing through; but those which nearly or quite grazed the parapet, in their fall took the buildings or wall in reverse, coming as they did from <num value="3">three</num> sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>The men, however, while sheltered in casemates, were beyond the reach of these missiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>So too of the bombs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Falling on the parapet and the <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> open parade of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> and exploding, their destructive force spent itself upon mere inanimate material. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>They set themselves to work to remedy this deficiency, though with small speed, for they had only <num value="6">six</num> needles in the fort with which to sew up cartridge-bags. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Toward <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> a new hope cheered them; they saw <num value="2">two</num> ships, and soon after <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, bearing the stars and stripes, appear off the harbor; it was a part of the relieving expedition they had been warned to expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Unfortunately, it proved unable to succor the fort either on that or the succeeding day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>A severe storm delayed some of the vessels, and prevented the tugs from reaching the harbor; and this storm also prevented the officers from making use of the limited resources remaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Therefore, to their chagrin, they and their men were forced by these untoward circumstances, and through no neglect of their own, to remain for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> little else than spectators of the bombardment to its close. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>It is impossible to estimate how long this mere interchange of shot and shell might have continued, had not other elements intervened to bring the combat to a close. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>The rebels had not failed to notice the effect; and on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> morning their use of these missiles became more frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>About <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day these buildings were once more in a blaze, and this time the fire caught in a portion of the roof of the officers' quarters which it was not immediately possible for the men to reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The flames were quickly beyond control; and now the serious problem was to remove as much powder from the magazine as might be needed for use, before that proceeding should become impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/><measure n="50barrels" type="mass">Fifty barrels</measure> were thus obtained and distributed about the casemates, when it was necessary to close and secure the door of the magazine. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>Through this rain the disbanded soldiers began to pour into <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName>, fagged out, hungry, and dejected, and having literally nowhere to turn their feet or lay their head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>History owes a page of honorable mention to the <rs>Federal</rs> capital for its unselfish generosity on this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>The rich and poor, the high and low of her loyal people, with <num value="1">one</num> quick and entirely unprompted impulse opened their doors and dealt out food and refreshment to the footsore, haggard, and half-starved men, whom ill-luck rather than their own delinquency had so unexpectedly reduced to tramps and fugitives. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>This good opinion was greatly augmented by the <rs>General</rs>'s own personal conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>He exhibited at once a promising energy and industry in repairing the shattered army organization; cleared <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName> of stragglers; established a more perfect military discipline than had hitherto been maintained; displayed great tact in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intercourse with both junior and senior officers; was free, affable, kind, patient, and attentive to all; manifested great talent and unceasing watchfulness in the details of military administration; and being young, vigilant, cheerful, intelligent, and apparently possessed of great professional skill, he reaped, almost at a single harvest, a well-nigh universal popularity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>It is in its political aspects that <placeName key="tgn,7013988" n="1.000 28" reg="bull run, prince william, virginia">Bull Run</placeName> becomes a great historical landmark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>To say that the hope and enthusiasm of the <rs>North</rs> received a painful shock of humiliation and disappointment, is to use but a mild description of the popular feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>This <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experience of defeat-or recognition of even the possibility of defeat &mdash; was inexpressibly bitter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>Stifling the sharp sorrow, however, the great public of the <rs>Free States</rs> sent up its prompt and united demand that the contest should be continued and the disgrace wiped out Impatience and over eagerness were chastened and repressed; and the <rs>North</rs> reconciled itself to the painful prospect of a tedious civil war all the more readily because of the necessity <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> of bending every energy to immediate preparation on a widely extended scale. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>If the <rs>North</rs> was cast down by the result of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, the <rs>South</rs> was in even a greater ratio encouraged and strengthened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>Vanity of personal prowess is a weakness of Southern character; and <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> became to the unthinking a demonstration of Southern invincibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>To the more cautious leaders the event was yet sufficiently flattering to inspire them with full confidence in ultimate success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>Perhaps the most potent influence of the battle was upon foreign nations, who now looked upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as a belligerent of <quote>great expectations;</quote> while speculative foreign capital turned somewhat eagerly to this promising new field of contraband trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>An important event, so silent in its operation that the public was scarcely conscious it was occurring, now became the pivot and controlling force of military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>This was the disbandment of the <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>Within a few weeks almost the whole <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men were mustered out and returned to their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>Only a few regiments re-enlisted with organizations even approximately unbroken; but out of the whole number of troops thus suddenly dissolved a considerable proportion immediately entered the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> service as individuals, and in many instances their drill and experience secured them election or appointment as officers in the new regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Thus the disappearance of an army brought a certain compensation; it not only furnished the new volunteers a quickening leaven, but that portion which went home to every Free State, and to some of the <rs>Border Slave States</rs>, served to greatly strengthen and correct public opinion in their several localities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>The <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> quota, and the increase of the regular <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> army, called by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0030.0018.00210.01130" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in advance of strict authority of law at the beginning of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, had so far progressed that garrisons and camps suffered no serious diminution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>Congress, being convened in special session, now legalized their enlistment, perfected their organization, and made liberal provision for their equipment and supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>It authorized an army of <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> men, and a national loan of <num value="250000000">two hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars; it provided an increase of the navy to render the blockade vigilant and rigorous; and enforcement, revenue, confiscation, and piracy laws were enacted or amended to meet the exigencies of active rebellion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>Pending the change and transformation of the volunteer forces from the <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> to the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> service, military operations necessarily came to a general cessation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>A few intensely exciting incidents occurred, of which the <rs type="place">Ball's Bluff</rs> disaster was, perhaps, the chief; but their consideration in detail does not fall within the scope of the present volume. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>In the rebel camps, also, inaction was both a policy and a necessity during the remainder of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>The trophies of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> having been gathered up, and its glory vaunted in Southern newspapers and stump speeches, the rebel commander once more advanced his outposts to the positions held before the battle, while the bulk of his army turned <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> into a fortified camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>Some of the earliest reasons <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> for this course are explained by <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0030.0018.00211.01132" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> with blunt frankness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>Many, therefore, in ignorance of their military obligations, left the army, not to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>Some hastened home to exhibit the trophies picked up on the field; others left their regiments without ceremony to attend to wounded friends, frequently accompanying them to hospitals in distant towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Such were the reports of general and staff officers and railroad officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>Starting with a series of favorable <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> accidents in the spring, the rebellion had confidently expected to hold every slave-holding State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>So far from realizing this hope, the end of the year witnessed the substantial loss to the conspiracy of the <num value="4">four</num> important Border States of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>This, together with the effective blockade instituted on the seaboard, and the lodgment gained by the brilliant naval victories at <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, already presaged the fate of disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>In a rough and hasty measurement of strength and unity, political and military, the relative proportions of population, wealth, and skill, and the no less potent elements of devotion to freedom, justice, and humanity, had already so far turned the scale as to foreshadow, with unerring certainty, that the seceding States would ultimately fail in their desperate appeal from the ballot to the bullet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>For the present, however, both the contestants remained confident, determined, and unceasingly active in gathering the huge armies destined, in the coming spring, to renew the mighty conflict. </p></div1>
