<head>A plea for culture.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0214.0001.00003.00001" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> somewhere says (borrowing the phrase from what <persName n="Johnson,Doctor,,,," id="n0214.0001.00003.00002" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> said of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>) that in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> every <num value="1">one</num> gets a mouthful of education, but scarcely any <num value="1">one</num> a full meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>It is the defect of some of our recent debates on this subject, that, instead of remedying the starvation, the reformers propose to deduct from the dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The disputants appear to agree in the assumption that an average Senior Sophister is a plethoric monster of learning, and that something must be done to take him down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>For this end, some plan to remove his <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> and Latin, others his <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00003.00003" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>, others again his mathematics,--all assuming it as a thing not to be tolerated, that <num value="1">one</num> small head should carry all he knows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Yet surely it needs but little actual observation of our college boys, in their more unguarded moments,--at the annual regatta, for instance, or among the young ladies on Class Day,--to mitigate these fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The Class Orator does not always impress us with any bewildering accumulation of mental attainments; nor does the head of the <rs>Lazy Club</rs> appear to possess more of any branch of letters than he can hope, by reasonable non-industry, to forget within a single year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Because the standard of acquirement has been raised within <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century, <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> it does not follow that it is now very high, for our so-called universities were once but high-schools, and it was no uncommon thing for boys to graduate with honor at <num value="17">seventeen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>I can easily recall <num value="3">three</num> successive <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> classes in which this happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>In <num value="1">one</num> class, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> scholars were of this unripe age; in another class, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> scholar; while in the intermediate class a student obtained very respectable rank, though graduating, at <num value="16">sixteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Honors thus obtained were the honors of school-boys, and showed a boyish standard of attainment; they gave no guaranty of real merit; they implied nothing which could reasonably be called scholarship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Yet academic laurels like these, with a year or <num value="2">two</num> of professional study super-added, were all that <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> had then to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He who wished for more must exile himself to find it, or must supply, as he best could, by solitary effort and with little encouragement, what should have been steadily urged upon him by the full force of some great institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>To say that later years have amended these things a little, is to say something; but the mass of our colleges are now what the highest were then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The advance in the means of education thus afforded in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> bears no comparison with the advance in material wealth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>And how has it been with the other instrumentalities of American culture, during the last <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure>? Schools have been improved, periodical publications multiplied, libraries quadrupled, music and pictures made more accessible, at least in our larger cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>These are gains, to be balanced by a few losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>For instance, an institution which was once more potent than all of these for the intellectual training of the adult <rs>American</rs> has almost ceased to exist in its original form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The engrossing <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> excitement of public affairs has nearly abolished the old <quote>Lyceum,</quote> and put a political orator in the lecturer's place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Science and art have long ceased to be the most available subjects for a popular lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00005.00004" reg="mostcommon:Agassiz,nomatch:0"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> and <persName n="Taylor,,Bayard,,," id="n0214.0001.00005.00005" reg="default:Taylor,Bayard,,,"><foreName>Bayard</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, by dint of exceedingly rapid and continuous travelling, can still find a few regions which <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00005.00006" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> will consent to hear described, outside of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>; and a few wandering lecturers on geology still haunt the field, their discourses being almost coeval with their specimens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00005.00007" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> still makes his stately tour, through wondering Western towns, where an enterprising public spirit sometimes, it is said, plans a dance for the same evening in the same hall,--<quote>Tickets to lecture and ball <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Yet the fact remains, that <num value="9">nine</num> addresses out of <num value="10">ten</num> in every popular course are simply stump-speeches, more or less eloquent; and though some moral enlightenment may come from this change of diet, yet to science and art it is a loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Take away the <rs type="place">Lowell</rs> and the <rs type="place">Cooper Institutes</rs>, and all our progress in wealth has secured for the public no increase of purely intellectual culture through lectures.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Now there are <num value="2">two</num> aspects to all material successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They are sublime or base only as they prepare the way for higher triumphs, or displace them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><persName n="Mann,,Horace,,," id="n0214.0001.00005.00008" reg="default:Mann,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Mann</surname></persName> lamented that in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> exhibitions the fine arts were always assigned a more conspicuous place than the useful arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0214.0001.00005.00009" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> complained that in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> the studios were better than the carpenters' shops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Both exulted in the thought that in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> these things were better ordered; and both therein approached the verge of concessions which would sacrifice the noblest aims of man. For carpentry and upholstery, good as a beginning, are despicable as an ending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>What cultivated person <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> would not prefer poorer lodgings and better museums?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I remember that, many years since, in a crowded country-house, I slept <num value="1">one</num> night on the floor beneath <persName n="Retzsch,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00006.00010" reg="mostcommon:Retzsch,nomatch:0"><surname>Retzsch</surname></persName>'s copy of the <rs>Sistine Madonna</rs>,--then perhaps the loveliest work of art on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>As I lay and watched the silent moonbeams enter and rest upon the canvas, I felt that my share of the hospitality was, after all, the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The couch might be comfortless, but the dreams were divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is such a hospitality that <num value="1">one</num> wishes, after all, from the age in which he lives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Culture is the training and finishing of the whole man, until he sees physical demands to be merely secondary, and pursues science and art as objects of intrinsic worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It undoubtedly places the fine arts above the useful arts, in a certain sense, and is willingly impoverished in material comforts, if it can thereby obtain nobler living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>When this impulse takes the form of a reactionary distrust of the whole spirit of the age, it is unhealthy and morbid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In its healthy form, it simply keeps alive the conviction that the life is more than meat; and so supplies that counterpoise to mere wealth which <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> vainly seeks to secure by aristocracies of birth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>So far as our colleges go, what is needed seems tolerably plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Our educational system requires a process of addition, not of subtraction; not to save our children from the painful necessity of studying this or that, but to gain for them the opportunity of studying that and more, in their own way. The demand for higher education outruns the supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>This is proved by the palpable fact, that more and more pupils are sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> for instruction, every year; and more from the <rs>Western States</rs> than from the <rs>Eastern</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>There are more and more young men of fortune whose parents will not stint them in education, <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> at least; more and more young men without wealth, who will live on bread and water, if need be, to gain knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>What we need is the opportunity of higher education somewhere,--that there should be some place in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> where a young man may go and study anything that kindles his enthusiasm, and find there instrumentalities to help the flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>As it is now, the maximum range of study in most of our colleges leaves a young man simply with a good preparation for <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, while the minimum leaves him very ill prepared for <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>What we need is a university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Whether this is to be a new creation, or something reared on the foundations now laid at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge</placeName>, or New Haven, or <placeName key="tgn,7013304" n="1.000 15" reg="ann arbor, washtenaw, michigan">Ann Arbor</placeName>, is unimportant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Until we have it somewhere, our means of culture are still provincial.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00007.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> this <num value="1">one</num> assumption, that we need a university, and then almost all the recent discussions on the subject seem to be merely questions of detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>There is small difficulty about discipline or selection of studies, when an institution undertakes to deal with men, not children, and assumes that they have come to learn, and not to be feruled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Give young men the opportunity to study anything which anybody in the land knows, and then the various departments will rest upon their own merits, and students will direct their course as parents direct, example influences, or genius guides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But compel them to give their time to something which neither they nor their parents desire, and the result will be ignorance, broken windows, and the torturing of Freshmen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>A more difficult point of detail, perhaps, will be to determine how much account should be made, in organizing such a university, of our present undergraduate system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>My own impression is, that the true basis of the <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> future university must be the professional schools, and that what is now called distinctively the <rs type="place">College</rs> must shrink into a preparatory department, instead of being accepted, as now, for the full sum of a liberal education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Even the professional schools are not yet liberal enough, and their very name indicates that they are founded with a view to certain avocations, and not with a view to culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It was a misfortune, in this respect, when the <rs type="place">Scientific School</rs> at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge</placeName> abandoned its projected departments of Latin and <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>; for these might have led the way (as at New Haven) to Philology, History, and Metaphysics, and would have helped to save science from being confounded with mere technological training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>On the other hand, the recent organization of an Academical Senate at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge</placeName> for the general government of all departments, and the introduction of University Lectures, are a great step towards giving us the larger system which the nation needs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The error committed in our colleges of making Latin and <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> compulsory, and therefore unattractive, should not make us forget that this is, after all, an error in the direction of high culture, and <num value="1">one</num> more pardonable in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> than anywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>These languages are a perpetual protest against the strong tendency to make all American education hasty and superficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They stand for a learning which makes no money, but helps to make men. Astronomy, metaphysics, the higher mathematics, and the critical or literary study of the modern languages, have the same advantage; but the <rs>Latin</rs> and <rs>Greek</rs> tongues represent this culture best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>For they remain still synonymous with accurate linguistic training, and with the study of form in literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Compared with these, all modern languages are undeniably loose in structure, <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> deficient in models, and destitute of the apparatus of critical study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It is certainly unfortunate that it is so, but there is the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The modern languages must be completely transformed, in structure, literary models, textbooks, and mode of teaching, before they can be used in education as we now use the <rs>Latin</rs> and <rs>Greek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I know of no institution in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> in which it is even attempted thus to use them,--none where they are yet taught except as accomplishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Nor is it apparent how they could be otherwise taught with the ordinary instrumentalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>A man may speak a dozen dialects as fluently as a European courier, and yet know as little as the courier knows of the principles of language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>On the other hand, it is impossible for any boy to have faithfully learned the simplest manual of Latin or <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> grammar without having laid some foundation for systematic philology.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>And as for the literary value of these languages, I will go still further, and with especial reference to that which there is most disposition to banish from use, the <name>Greek</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It certainly is not a hasty or boyish judgment on my part, nor yet <num value="1">one</num> in which pedantry or servility can have much to do, when I deliberately avow the belief that the <name>Greek</name> literature is still so entirely unequalled among the accumulated memorials of the world, that it seems to differ from all others in kind rather than in degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>In writing this, I am thinking less of <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00009.00012" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName> than of <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00009.00013" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, and not more of <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00009.00014" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName> than of the dramatic and lyric poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>So far from the knowledge of other literatures tending to depreciate the <name>Greek</name>, it seems to me that no <num value="1">one</num> can adequately value this who has not come back to it after long study of the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><persName n="Ampere,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00009.00015" reg="mostcommon:Ampere,nomatch:0"><surname>Ampere</surname></persName>, that master of <name>French</name> prose, has hardly overstated the truth when he says that the man best versed in all other books <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> must say, after all, in returning to a volume of <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00010.00016" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName> or <persName n="Sophocles,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00010.00017" reg="mostcommon:Sophocles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sophocles</surname></persName>,--<quote>Here is beauty, true and sovereign; its like was never written among men,--<foreign lang="fr">Voila la beaute veritable et souveraine; jamais il ne s'est &eacute;crit rien de pareil chez les hommes.</foreign></quote> I do not see how there could possibly be a list of the dozen masterpieces of the world's literature, of which at least <num value="0.5">one half</num> should not be <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>And, indeed, when <num value="1">one</num> considers the mere vehicle, the language itself, <num value="1">one</num> must remember that there is no more possibility of arbitrary choice in languages than in stones; the best is the best; and <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, the native tongue of sculptors, is the only tongue that has the texture of marble.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Perhaps every man of studious habits, growing occasionally impatient of the healthful practical duties which <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName> life involves, has his own whim as to his imaginary employments in case illness or other interference should deny him even the action of the pen, and throw him entirely upon books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>I can remember a time, for <num value="1">one</num>, when the <rs>State</rs> prison would have looked rather alluring to me, if it had guaranteed a copy of the <foreign lang="fr">Mecanique Celeste</foreign>, with full leisure to read it. But foremost among such fantastic attractions are those which obtained actual control over that <name>English</name> clerygyman, described in <persName n="Hogg,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00010.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hogg,nomatch:0"><surname>Hogg</surname></persName>'s Life of <persName n="Shelley,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00010.00019" reg="mostcommon:Shelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Shelley</surname></persName>, who had for his <num value="1">one</num> sole aim in existence the reiterated perusal of a <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> course of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He had no family, almost no professional duties, a moderate income, and perfect health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He took his <num value="3">three</num> meals a day and his <num value="2">two</num> short walks; and all the rest of his waking hours, for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, he gave to <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>No; he read a newspaper once a week, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times a year he read a few pages of <persName><foreName>Virgil</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00010.00020" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,nomatch:0"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>, just to satisfy himself that it <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> was a waste of time for a man who could read <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> to read their writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>On Sunday he turned to the <name>Septuagint</name> and the New Testament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>From his <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> course of authors he never deviated; when they were ended, he began again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The only exception was <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00011.00021" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, whose works were read every year during a summer vacation of a month at the sea-shore,--<quote>the proper place to read <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00011.00022" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>,</quote> he said.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It is hard to imagine a life which would seem to most <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00011.00023" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> more utterly misspent than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Misspent it was, but how harmlessly and how happily!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>What pure delight, what freedom from perturbation and care, when a dictionary and a dozen books furnished luxury for a lifetime!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>What were wealth and fame, peerages and palaces, to him who had all <persName n="Aeschylus,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00011.00024" reg="mostcommon:Aeschylus,nomatch:0"><surname>Aeschylus</surname></persName> for a winter residence, and <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00011.00025" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName> for the seaside!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>And a culture which seems remotest from practical ends may not only thus furnish exhaustless intellectual enjoyment, but may educate <num value="1">one</num>'s aesthetic perceptions to the very highest point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>But I repeat, that all preference as to department of study is a secondary and incidental matter, and the special student of any pursuit will have sympathies with the devotees of all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The essential thing is, that we should recognize, as a nation, the value of all culture, and resolutely organize it into our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>As a stimulus to this we must constantly bear in mind, and cheerfully acknowledge, that American literature is not yet copious, <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> American scholarship not profound, <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> not highly intellectual, and the <rs>American</rs> style of execution, in all high arts, yet hasty and superficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>There are single works, and there are individual authors; but the readiness with which their names suggest themselves shows how exceptional they are. They represent no considerable literary class, scarcely even a cultivated class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>This is true even of the clergy, and of lawyers and physicians still more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>They are absorbed, perhaps inevitably, in the practical side of their occupations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The chief discouragement of American literature does not seem to me to lie in the want of an international copyright law, as some think, nor in the fact that other pursuits bid higher prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The true, great want is of an atmosphere of sympathy in intellectual aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>An artist can afford to be poor, but not to be companionless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It is not well that he should feel pressing on him, in addition to his own doubt whether he can achieve a certain work, the weight of the public doubt whether it be worth achieving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> art is a career, the greatest and most permanent career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>History there lies around <num value="1">one</num>, a perpetual incentive, since art has everywhere survived all else, and proved itself alone immortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>But here <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> art is still an alien,--tolerated, protected, respected even, but without a vote.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>What we thus miss in literary culture may be best explained by showing the result of the universal political culture which we possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>It is often noticed that, while the leaders of public affairs in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> are usually what are called self-made men, this is not the case with our literary leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Among <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class American writers, culture is usually in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> generation; they have usually <quote>tumbled about in a library,</quote> as <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00015.00031" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName> says, in childhood; at all events, they are usually college-bred men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The choice of names may be open to question, but the general fact is undoubted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Now if it be true that there are fewer among us who rise from the ranks in literature than in politics, it seems not merely to indicate that literature, as being a finer product than statesmanship, implies more elaborate training; but also that our institutions guarantee such training in the <num value="1">one</num> case, and not in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Every American boy imbibes political knowledge through the pores of his skin; every newspaper, every caucus, contributes to his instruction; and he is expected to have mature convictions before he is <num value="14">fourteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>In the height of the last Presidential contest, a little boy was hung out of a school window by his heels, within my knowledge, because his small comrades disapproved his political sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>For higher intellectual pursuits there are not only no such penalties among us, but there are no such opportunities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Yet <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> in <placeName reg="Athinai, Perifereia Protevousis, Ellas" key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> &mdash; with its <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> statues, with the tragedies of <persName n="Aeschylus,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00016.00040" reg="mostcommon:Aeschylus,nomatch:0"><surname>Aeschylus</surname></persName> performed for civic prizes, and the histories of <persName n="Herodotus,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00016.00041" reg="mostcommon:Herodotus,nomatch:0"><surname>Herodotus</surname></persName> read at the public games &mdash; a boy could no more grow up ignorant of art than he could here remain untrained in politics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>When we are once convinced that this higher training is desirable, we shall begin to feel the worth of our accumulated wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>That is true of wealth which <persName n="Talleyrand,,,,," id="n0214.0001.00016.00042" reg="mostcommon:Talleyrand,nomatch:0"><surname>Talleyrand</surname></persName> said of wisdom,--<hi rend="italics">everybody</hi> is richer than <hi rend="italics">anybody</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>For we must carefully distinguish between a want of cultivated sympathy with the higher intellectual pursuits, and a want of popular respect for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It is this distinction which relieves the <rs>American</rs> people from the imputation of materialism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Who were these civilians?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>There was not a millionnaire among them; scarcely a man eminent in mere business pursuits; scarcely a man whose fame was based on his income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>They were statesmen, preachers, lecturers, poets,--men standing low on the income-lists, and high only on the scale of intangible services,--heroes whose popularity might often be exaggerated in quantity, no doubt, but in its quality was always honorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The community seeks wealth, but it knows <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> how to respect its public men who are poor through honesty, or its scholars who are poor for the sake of knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>It is useless to complain that, in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, Science is preceding Art; that is inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>As yet there is a shrinking even from pure science,--that is, from all science which is not directly marketable; and while this is so, art must be still further postponed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We have hitherto valued science for its applications, natural history as a branch of agriculture, mathematics for the sake of life-assurance tables, and even a college education as a training for members of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Just so far as any of these departments have failed of these ends, there is a tendency to disparage them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>We are a little like the <rs>President Dupaty</rs> of the <rs>French Assembly</rs>, who told the astronomer <rs>Laplace</rs> that he considered the discovery of a new planet to be far less important than that of a new pudding, since we had already more planets than we knew what to do with, while we never could have puddings enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>We are now outgrowing this limited view of science, but in regard to literature the delusion still remains; if it is to be anything more than an amusement, it must afford solid information; it is not yet owned that it has value for itself, as an art. Of course, all true instruction, however conveyed, is palatable; to a healthy mind the <foreign lang="fr">Mecanique Celeste</foreign> is good reading; so is <placeName reg="Mill, Noord-Brabant, Nederland" key="tgn,1047954">Mill</placeName>'s , <quote>Political economy,</quote> or <persName n="Morgan,,De,,," id="n0214.0002.00028.00067" reg="default:Morgan,De,,,"><foreName>De</foreName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s <quote>Formal logic.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Words afford a more delicious music than the chords of any instrument; they are susceptible of richer colors than any painter's palette; and that they should be used merely for the transportation of intelligence, as a wheel-barrow carries brick, is not enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>A book without art is simply a commodity; it may be exceedingly valuable to the consumer, very profitable to the producer, but it does not come within the domain of pure literature.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>To pursue literature as an art is not therefore to be a mathematician nor a political economist; still less to be a successful journalist, like <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00029.00070" reg="mostcommon:Greeley,nomatch:0"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, or a lecturer with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> annual invitations, like <persName n="Gough,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00029.00071" reg="mostcommon:Gough,nomatch:0"><surname>Gough</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>These careers have really no more to do with literature than has the stage or the bar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Across the water, this tendency seems to increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Just as an Englishman <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> often seems ashamed to speak well, and pooh-poohs all oratory, so he is beginning to show the same slipshod manner on paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>It is an exciting thing to remember the time when all literature was in the inflammatory stage of this superinduced disorder; but does any <num value="1">one</num> now read <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00032.00091" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s <persName n="Revolution,,French,,," id="n0214.0002.00032.00092" reg="default:Revolution,French,,,"><foreName>French</foreName> <surname>Revolution</surname></persName> without a sense of pain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Every year now shows that the whole trick of style with which it was written was false from beginning to end. For surely no style can be permanently attractive that is not simple.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/><hi rend="italics">Simplicity</hi> must be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> element of literary art. This assertion will no doubt run counter to the common belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Most persons have an impression of something called style in writing,--as they have an impression of something called architecture in building,--that is external and superadded, instead of being the very basis and law of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>There is the house, they think, and, if you can afford it, you put on some architecture; there is the writing, and a college-bred man is expected to put on some style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The implied assumption is, that he is less likely than another to write simply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>This shows our school-boy notions of culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>A really cultivated person is less likely to waste words on mere ornamentation, just as he is less likely to have gingerbread-work on his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/><pb id="p.33" n="33"/> Good taste simplifies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Men whose early culture was deficient are far more apt to be permanently sophomoric than those who lived through the sophomore at the proper time and place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The reason is, that the habit of expression, in a cultivated person, matures with his life; but when a man has had much life and very little expression, he is confused by his own thoughts, and does not know how much to attempt or how to discriminate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>When such a person falls on honest slang, it is usually a relief, for then he uses language which is fresh and real to him; whereas such phrases in a cultivated person usually indicate mere laziness and mental undress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Indeed, almost all slang is like parched corn, and should be served up hot, or else not at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>But it is evident that mere simplicity of style is not enough, for there is a manner of writing which does not satisfy us, though it may be simple and also carefully done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Such, for instance, is the prose style of <persName n="Southey,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00033.00093" reg="mostcommon:Southey,nomatch:0"><surname>Southey</surname></persName>, which was apparently the model for all American writing in its day. We see the result in the early volumes of the <orgName n="North American Review" type="newspaper">North American Review</orgName>, whose traditions of rather tame correctness were what enabled us to live through the <name>Carlyle</name> epoch with safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The aim of this style was to avoid all impulse, brilliancy, or surprise, and to be perfectly colorless; it was a highly polished smoothness, on which the thoughts rolled like balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But style is capable of something more than smoothness and clearness; you see this something more when you turn from <persName n="Prescott,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00033.00094" reg="mostcommon:Prescott,nomatch:0"><surname>Prescott</surname></persName> to <persName n="Motley,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00033.00095" reg="mostcommon:Motley,nomatch:0"><surname>Motley</surname></persName>, for instance; there is a new quality in the page, --it has become alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/><hi rend="italics">Freshness</hi> is perhaps the best word to describe this additional element; it is a style that has blood in it. This may come from various sources,good health, animal spirits, outdoor habits, or simply an <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> ardent nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It is hard to describe this quality, or to give rules for it; the most obvious way to acquire it is to keep <num value="1">one</num>'s life fresh and vigorous, to write only what presses to be said, and to utter that as if the world waited for the saying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Where lies the extraordinary power of <quote><persName n="Eyre,,Jane,,," id="n0214.0002.00034.00096" reg="default:Eyre,Jane,,,"><foreName>Jane</foreName> <surname>Eyre</surname></persName>,</quote> for instance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>In the intense earnestness which vitalizes every line; each atom of the author's life appears to come throbbing and surging through it; every sentence seems endowed with a soul of its own, and looks up at you with human eyes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The next element of literary art may be said to be <hi rend="italics">structure</hi>. So strong in the <rs>American</rs> mind is the demand for organization, that the logical element of style, which is its skeleton, is not rare among us. But this is only the basis; besides the philosophical structure of a statement, which comes by thought, there is an artistic structure, which implies the education of the taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>So, in the human body, there is a symmetry of the bony frame, and there is a further symmetry of the rounded flesh which should cover it; and in literature it is not enough to have a perfectly framed logical skeleton,there should be also a well-proportioned beauty of utterance, which is the flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Unless this inward and outward structure exist, although a book may be never so valuable, it hardly comes within the domain of literary art.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>These different types of structure may perhaps be illustrated by <num value="3">three</num> different books, all belonging to the intermediate ground between science and art. I should say that Buckle's <quote>History of civilization,</quote> with all its wealth and vigor, is exceedingly loose-jointed in all its logical structure, and also very defective in its literary structure, although it happens to have an element of freshness which is rare in such a work, and carries the reader along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/><pb id="p.35" n="35"/> <persName n="Darwin,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00035.00097" reg="mostcommon:Darwin,nomatch:0"><surname>Darwin</surname></persName>'s <quote>Origin of species</quote> is better; that has at the bottom a strong logic, whether conclusive or otherwise, but is so rambling and confused in its merely literary statement, that it does itself no justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> book, <persName n="Huxley,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00035.00098" reg="mostcommon:Huxley,nomatch:0"><surname>Huxley</surname></persName>'s <quote>Lectures,</quote> combines with its logic a power of clear and symmetrical statement that gives it a rare charm, and makes it a contribution, not to science alone, but to literature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>In what is called poetry, <foreign lang="fr">belles-lettres</foreign>, or pure literature, the osseous structure is of course hidden; and the symmetry suggested is always that of taste rather than of logic, though logic must be always implied, or at least never violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>In some of the greatest modern authors, however, there are limitations or drawbacks to this symmetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/><persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0214.0002.00035.00099" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> said admirably of her favorite <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00035.00100" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, that he had the artist's hand, but not the artist's love of structure; and in all his prose writings <num value="1">one</num> sees a certain divergent and centrifugal habit, which completely overpowers him before the end of <quote><persName n="Meister,,Wilhelm,,," id="n0214.0002.00035.00101" reg="default:Meister,Wilhelm,,,"><foreName>Wilhelm</foreName> <surname>Meister</surname></persName>,</quote> and shows itself even in the <quote>Elective affinities,</quote> which is, so far as I know, his most perfect prose work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>In <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00035.00102" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, again, <num value="1">one</num> observes a similar defect; his unit of structure is the sentence, and the periods seem combined merely by the accident of juxtaposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Each sentence is a pearl, and the whole essay is so much clipped from the necklace; but it is fastened at neither end, and the beads slip off; when you try to replace them, you find that they belong in <num value="1">one</num> place as well as in another.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Yet it is not enough for human beauty to possess symmetry of structure, within and without: there must be a beautiful coloring also, wealth of complexion, fineness <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> of texture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>So the next element of literary art lies in the <hi rend="italics">choice of words</hi>. Style must have richness and felicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Words in a master's hands seem more than words; he can double or quadruple their power by skill in using; and this is a result so delightful as to give to certain authors a value out of all proportion to their thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>There are books which are luxuries, <foreign lang="fr">livres de luxe</foreign>, whose pages seem builded of materials more precious than those of common life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>But thus to be crowned monarch of the sunset, to trust <num value="1">one</num>'s self with full daring in these realms of glory, demands such a balance of endowments as no <num value="1">one</num> in <name>English</name> literature save <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00036.00105" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName> has attained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>In choosing words, it is to be remembered that there is not a really poor <num value="1">one</num> in any language; each had originally some vivid meaning, but most of them have been worn smooth by passing from hand to hand, and hence the infinite care required in their use. <quote>Language,</quote> says <persName n="Muller,,Max,,," id="n0214.0002.00036.00106" reg="default:Muller,Max,,,"><foreName>Max</foreName> <surname>Muller</surname></persName>, <quote>is a dictionary of faded metaphors</quote> ; and every writer who creates a new image, or even reproduces an old <num value="1">one</num> by passing it through a fresh mind, enlarges this vast treasure-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>And this applies not only to words of beauty, but to words of wit. <quote>All wit,</quote> said <persName n="Pitt,Mister,,,," id="n0214.0002.00036.00107" reg="mostcommon:Pitt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pitt</surname></persName>, <quote>is true reasoning</quote> ; and <persName n="Rogers,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00036.00108" reg="mostcommon:Rogers,Ezekiel,,,:2"><surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, who preserved this saying, added, that he himself had lived long before making the discovery that wit was truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>A final condition of literary art is <hi rend="italics">thoroughness</hi>, which must be shown both in the preparation and in the revision of <num value="1">one</num>'s work.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Yet the labor of preparation is not, after all, more important than that of final revision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The feature of literary art which is always least appreciated by the public, and even by young authors, is the amount of toil it costs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>But all the standards, all the precedents of every art, show that the greatest gifts do not supersede the necessity of work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The most astonishing development of native genius in any-direction, so far as I know, is that of <persName n="Mozart,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00037.00117" reg="mostcommon:Mozart,nomatch:0"><surname>Mozart</surname></persName> in music; yet it is he who has left the remark, that, if few equalled him in his vocation, few had studied it with such persevering labor and such unremitting zeal.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It is to rebuke this literary indolence, and to afford a perpetual standard of high art, that the study of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> ought to be retained in our schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The whole future of our literature may depend upon it; to abandon it is deliberately to forego the very highest models.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>There is no other literature which so steadily reproaches a young writer,--nothing else by which he may sustain himself till he forms a high standard of his own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>But the true use of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> literature is perpetually to remind us what a wondrous thing literary art may be,--capable of what range of resources, of what thoroughness in structure, of what perfection in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It is a remarkable fact, that the most penetrating and fearless of all our writers, <persName n="Thoreau,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00038.00121" reg="mostcommon:Thoreau,nomatch:0"><surname>Thoreau</surname></persName>, -he who made Nature his sole mistress, and shook himself utterly free from human tradition,--yet clung to <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> literature as the <num value="1">one</num> achievement of man that seemed worthy to take rank with Nature, pronouncing it <quote>as refined, as solidly done, and as beautiful almost as the morning itself.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>These are the qualities of style that seem most obviously important,--simplicity, freshness, structure, choice of words, and thoroughness both of preparation and of finish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Yet, in aiming at literary art, it must be remembered that all the cardinal virtues go into a good style, while each of the <measure n="7" type="dead">seven dead</measure>ly sins tends to vitiate a bad <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>What a charm in the merit of humility, for instance, <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> as it is sometimes seen in style, leading to a certain self-restraint and moderation of tone, however weighty the argument!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>It would be hardly safe to illustrate what has been said by any multiplication of examples from our own literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It is not always the greatest writers of whom this is true, for <num value="1">one</num>'s demands upon the vehicle of thought are in proportion to his thoughts, and great ideas strain language more than small ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>His early solitude narrowed his affinities, and gave a kind of bloodlessness to his style; clear in hue, fine in texture, it is apt to want the mellow tinge which indicates a robust and copious life.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Perhaps the conclusion of the whole matter may seem to be that literary art is so lofty a thing as to be beyond the reach of any of us; as the sage in Rasselas, discoursing on poetry, only convinces his hearers that no <num value="1">one</num> ever can be a poet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>After so much in the way of discouragement, it should be added,--what the most limited experience may teach us all,--that there is no other pursuit so unceasingly delightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>What cannot there be read, however, is the sterner history of those who were simply neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>I well remember the apathy with which even the enlarged edition of <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct> was received, in spite of the warm admiration of a few; nor was it until the publication of <quote>The scarlet letter,</quote> in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, that its author could fairly be termed famous.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Probably the truth is, that art precedes criticism, and that every great writer creates or revives the taste by which he is appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>True, we are wont to claim that <quote><num value="1">one</num> touch of nature makes the whole world kin</quote> ; but it sometimes takes the world a good while to acknowledge its poor relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It seems hard for most persons <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> to recognize a touch of nature when they see it. The trees have formed their buds in autumn every year since trees <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> waved; yet you will find that the great majority of persons have never made that discovery, but suppose that Nature gets up those ornaments in spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>And if we are thus blind to what hangs conspicuously before our eyes for the whole long winter of every year, how unobservant must we be of the rarer phases of earthly beauty and of human life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Keep to the conventional, and you have something which all have seen, even if they disapprove; copy Nature, and her colors make art appear incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>If you could paint the sunset before your window as gorgeous as it is, your picture would be hooted from the walls of the exhibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>If you were to write into fiction the true story of the man or woman you met yesterday, it would be scouted as too wildly unreal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Indeed, the literary artist may almost say, as did the <rs>Duke</rs> of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00043.00151" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> when urged to write his memoirs, <quote>I should like to speak the truth; but if I did, I should be torn in pieces.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Therefore the writer, when he adopts a high aim, must be a law to himself, bide his time, and take the risk of discovering, at last, that his life has been a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>His task is <num value="1">one</num> in which failure is easy, when he must not only depict the truths of Nature, but must do this with such verisimilitude as to vindicate its truth to other eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>And since this recognition may not even begin till after his death, we can see what Rivarol meant by his fine saying, that <quote>genius is only great patience,</quote> and <persName n="Buffon,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00043.00152" reg="mostcommon:Buffon,nomatch:0"><surname>Buffon</surname></persName>, by his more guarded definition of genius as the aptitude for patience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Of all literary qualities, this patience has thus far been rarest in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Therefore, there has been in our <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> literature scarcely any quiet power; if effects are produced, they must, in literature as in painting, be sensational, and cover acres of canvas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>As yet, the mass of our writers seek originality in mere externals; we think, because we live in a new country, we are unworthy of ourselves if we do not Americanize the grammar and spelling-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>In a republic, must the objective case be governed by a verb?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>We shall yet learn that it is not new literary forms we need, but only fresh inspiration, combined with cultivated taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The standard of good art is always much the same; modifications are trifling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Otherwise we could not enjoy any foreign literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>A fine phrase in <persName n="Aeschylus,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00044.00153" reg="mostcommon:Aeschylus,nomatch:0"><surname>Aeschylus</surname></persName> or <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00044.00154" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName> affects us as if we had read it in <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00044.00155" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Art has therefore its law; and eccentricity, though often promising as a mere trait of youth, is only a disfigurement to maturer years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>I do not mean merely that they speak without elegance, but that in moments of confidence they say <quote>We was,</quote> and <quote>Them things,</quote> and <quote>I done it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>With the present predominance of merely scientific studies, and the increasing distaste for the study of language, this will not soon diminish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>For all that, there are already visible, in the <rs>American</rs> temperament, <num value="2">two</num> points of great promise in respect to art in general, and literary art above all.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>If this is not yet brought to bear on literature, it is only because the time has not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>It is visible everywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The aim which <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0214.0002.00045.00160" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> avowed as his highest ambition for <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 5" reg="france">France</placeName>, to convert all trades into arts, is being rapidly fulfilled all around us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>It is clear that this same impulse, in higher and higher applications, must culminate in the artistic creation of beauty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>And to fortify this fine instinct, we may trust, secondly, in the profound earnestness which still marks our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>With all this flexibility, there is yet a solidity of principle beneath, that makes the subtile American mind as real and controlling as that of the robust race from which it sprang.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Though the present tendency of our art is towards foreign models, this is but a temporary thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>We must look at these till we have learned what they can <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> teach, but a race in which the moral nature is strongest will be its own guide at last.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>And it is a comfort thus to end in the faith that, as the foundation of all true greatness is in the conscience, so we are safe if we can but carry into science and art the same earnestness of spirit which has fought through the great civil war and slain slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>The voyager from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> who lands upon our shores perceives a difference in the sky above his head; the height seems loftier, the zenith more remote, the horizon-wall more steep; the moon appears to hang in middle air, beneath a dome that arches far beyond it. The sense of natural symbolism is so strong in us, that the mind seeks a spiritual significance in this glory of the atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>It is not enough to find the sky enlarged, and not the mind,--<foreign lang="la">coelum, non animum</foreign>. <num value="1">One</num> wishes to be convinced that here the intellectual man inhales a deeper breath, and walks with bolder tread; that philosopher and artist are here more buoyant, more fresh, more fertile; that the human race has here escaped at <num value="1">one</num> bound from the despondency of ages, as from their wrongs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>And the true and healthy Americanism is to be found, let us believe, in this attitude of hope; an attitude not necessarily connected with culture nor with the absence of culture, but with the consciousness of a new impulse given to all human progress.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>It seems unspeakably important that all persons among us, and especially the student and the writer, should be pervaded with Americanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Americanism includes the faith that national self-government is not a chimera, but that, with whatever inconsistencies and drawbacks, we are steadily establishing it here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>It includes the faith that to this good thing all other good things must in time be added.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>When a man is heartily imbued with such a national sentiment as this, it is as marrow in his bones and blood in his veins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>He may still need culture, but he has the basis of all culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>He is entitled to an imperturbable patience and hopefulness, born of a living faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>All that is scanty in our intellectual attainments, or poor in our artistic life, may then be cheerfully endured: if a man sees his house steadily rising on sure foundations, he can wait or let his children wait for the cornice and the frieze.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>It is a thing not to be forgotten, that for a long series of years the people of our Northern States were habitually in advance of their institutions of learning, in courage and comprehensiveness of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>There were long years during which the most cultivated scholar, so soon as he embraced an unpopular opinion, was apt to find the college doors closed against him, and only the country lyceum &mdash; the people's college &mdash; left open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The home of real thought was outside, not inside, <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> the college walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>It hardly embarrassed a professor's position if he defended slavery as a divine institution; but he risked his place if he denounced the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>In those days, if by any chance a man of bold opinions drifted into a reputable professorship, we listened sadly to hear his voice grow faint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>He usually began to lose his faith, his courage, his toleration,--in short, his Americanism,--when he left the ranks of the uninstructed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>That time is past; and the literary class has now come more into sympathy with the popular heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>It is perhaps fortunate that there is as yet but little <foreign lang="fr">esprit de corps</foreign> among our writers, so that they receive their best sympathy, not from each other, but from the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>When we American writers find grace to do our best, it is not so much because we are sustained by each other, as that we are conscious of a deep popular heart, slowly but surely answering back to ours, and offering a worthier stimulus than the applause of a coterie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>If we once lose faith in our audience, the muse grows silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Even the apparent indifference of this audience to culture and high finish may be in the end a wholesome influence, recalling us to those more important things, compared to which these are secondary qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>The indifference is only comparative; our public prefers good writing, as it prefers good elocution; but it values energy, heartiness, and action more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>The public is right; it is the business of the writer, as of the speaker, to perfect the finer graces without sacrificing things more vital.

<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> demand made by the public upon every composition is, of course, that it should be attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>If, therefore, in writing, you find it your mission to be abstruse, fight to render your statement clear and attractive, as if your life depended on it: your literary life does depend on it, and, if you fail, relapses into a dead language, and becomes, like that of <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0214.0004.00078.00240" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>, only a <hi rend="italics">Biographia Literaria</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Thus easily did mythology explain all troublesome inconsistencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>But it is much that it should even have recognized them, at so early an epoch, as needing explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>There are, to be sure, some flowers of rhetoric in the way. The obstacle <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> to the participation of women in the alphabet, or in any other privilege, has been thought by some to be the fear of impairing her delicacy, or of destroying her domesticity, or of confounding the distinction between the sexes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>I doubt it. These have been plausible excuses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>They have even been genuine, though minor anxieties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>But the whole thing, I take it, had always <num value="1">one</num> simple, intelligible basis,--sheer contempt for the supposed intellectual inferiority of woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>She was not to be taught, because she was not worth teaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>The learned <rs>Acidalius</rs>, aforesaid, was in the majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>According to <persName><foreName>Aristotle</foreName></persName> and the <name>Peripatetics</name>, woman was <foreign lang="la">animal occasionatum</foreign>, as if a sort of monster and accidental production.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>It was the same with political rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>The foundation of the <rs>Salic Law</rs> was not any sentimental anxiety to guard female delicacy and domesticity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>And the same principle was reaffirmed for our own institutions, in rather softened language, by <persName n="Parsons,,Theophilus,,," id="n0214.0005.00102.00349" reg="default:Parsons,Theophilus,,,"><foreName>Theophilus</foreName> <surname>Parsons</surname></persName>, in his famous defence of the rights of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> men (the <quote><persName n="Essex,,,,," id="n0214.0005.00102.00350" reg="mostcommon:Essex,nomatch:0"><surname>Essex</surname></persName> result,</quote> in <dateStruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></dateStruct>): <quote>Women, what <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> age soever they are of, are not considered as having a sufficient acquired discretion [to exercise the franchise].</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>Yet how can we wonder at these opinions, when the saints have been severer than the sages?--since the pious <rs>Fenelon</rs> taught that true virgin delicacy was almost as incompatible with learning as with vice; and <persName n="Channing,Doctor,,,," id="n0214.0005.00103.00354" reg="mostcommon:Channing,Edward,,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName> complained, in his <quote>Essay on exclusion and Denunciation,</quote> of <quote>women forgetting the tenderness of their sex,</quote> and arguing on theology.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Now this impression of feminine inferiority may be right or wrong, but it obviously does a good deal towards explaining the facts it assumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>If contempt does not originally cause failure, it perpetuates it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>All generations of women having been bred under the shadow of intellectual contempt, they have, of course, done much to justify it. They have often used <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> only for frivolous purposes even the poor opportunities allowed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Of course, if women know as much as men, without schools and colleges, there is no need of admitting them to those institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>If they work as well on half pay, it diminishes the inducement to give them the other half.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>As it was, the character of the war was, on the whole, humane; few towns were sacked or destroyed, the harvests were bounteous and freely gathered, and the population increased during the whole period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>There prevailed for a long time, in America, a certain superstition about collegiate education.
