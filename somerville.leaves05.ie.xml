<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The full title of this paper should be <q direct="unspecified">Old and Historic Trees in and about <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>,</q> for some of the trees mentioned are simply old, and have no connection with history properly speaking; that is, they are not connected with events of importance in the nation's annals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>There are a number of trees now standing which date back as far as the <name>Revolution</name>, a time which is rich in <q direct="unspecified">local color.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The <address><street n="Washington street">Washington</street></address> elm is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these to occur to the mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Of the trees simply ancient, the <rs type="place">Waverley oaks</rs> and the <name>Hemlock</name> wood of the <rs>Arnold Arboretum</rs> are prominent examples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Around these trees there is an atmosphere which fires the imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>We long for the genius and the pen of a <persName n="Muir,,John,,," id="n0305.0001.00001.00002" reg="default:Muir,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Muir</surname></persName> to penetrate the mystery and interpret the charm which surrounds these patriarchs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The emotion they awake is akin to awe, and is like that which inspired the writers of some of the grandest psalms, the psalms of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It stirs the reverent side of our being, while the feeling with which we view a tree like the <rs>Washington</rs> elm, in addition to our respect for its age, is that of pride and patriotism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>When we think of the events which have happened since the time of the early settlers, when this tree was young, or in its prime,&mdash;their struggles with nature and the <name>Indians</name>, sometimes with each other, the events which led to the <name>Revolution</name>, the birth of the constitution, the rise of the anti-slavery movement, and the final triumph of its advocates, the progress of science, the inventions which contribute so much to our happiness, the birth of <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> literature and art in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>,&mdash;when we think of what all this means, the thought of human achievement stimulates us to try to keep up to the high standard set by our predecessors, especially those who rocked the <q direct="unspecified">cradle of Liberty</q> in the troublous times preceding the <name>Revolution</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><num value="1">One</num> of these, represented as the largest, was the <q direct="unspecified">Old Elm</q> on Boston Common, blown down in the great storm of <dateStruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The <num value="2">two</num> others were near the middle of what is now <address><street n="Park street">Park street</street></address>, both long since victims of the march of time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><address><street n="Shawmut street">Shawmut</street></address>, as the new settlement was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> named, thus presented a striking contrast to <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, which is said to have been covered with timber at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Fuel was obtained from <placeName key="tgn,1006938" n="1.000 3" reg="deer island,new brunswick,canada,north and central america">Deer Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>So the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty of the new comers was to plant trees, and with an eye to domestic economy the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> trees planted: were probably fruit trees.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>There were large gardens on the summit of <placeName key="possibilities=40" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Beacon Hill</placeName>, and also some belonging to the residences along <address><street n="Summer street">Summer street</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We are higher up in the world than we had expected to be, and the water of the town cove comes in nearly to the foot of the hill on which we stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><pb id="p.3" n="3"/></p> 
<p>A more distant outlook is over the roofs of houses and the masts of ships to the beautiful land-locked harbor and island studded bay. In another direction, where we had thought to see the massive pile of the <placeName reg="new Court House">new Court House</placeName>, a steep, grassy knoll rises behind the scattered houses, which with their gardens lie between it and the road.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Let us enter the front gate of the nearest of these houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>An old gentle-woman and a child, perhaps <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> of age, are walking in the <rs>South</rs> garden which lieth under it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>While we are in this hill garden, let us take a look across the basin of the <rs>Charles</rs> and see if we cannot perceive the outlines of another orchard lying in the edge of <placeName reg="Watertown, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014591">Watertown</placeName>, which was planted about the same time on land which <persName n="Stone,,Simon,,," id="n0305.0001.00003.00008" reg="default:Stone,Simon,,,"><foreName>Simon</foreName> <surname>Stone</surname></persName> chose for his dwelling-place soon after his arrival in <dateStruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The old gardens on <placeName key="possibilities=40" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Beacon Hill</placeName> have long ago made room for modern buildings, but <num value="1">one</num> of the trees of the orchard in <placeName reg="Watertown, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014591">Watertown</placeName>, a pear tree, is still standing in <placeName reg="Old Cambridge Cemetery">Old Cambridge Cemetery</placeName>, twisted and gnarled by the storms of <measure n="260years" type="date">two hundred and sixty years</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Tree vandalism is not a new thing, for in <dateStruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></dateStruct> the town passed an order to <q direct="unspecified">prevent the trees planted in the settlement from being spoiled.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>So tree-planting went merrily on, with as little conception of the great events which should take place under their branches a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> or more later as we have when we plant for the future on Arbor Day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Of the other trees on Boston Common, the oldest are those in the <placeName reg="Beacon, Falls, Texas" key="tgn,2153022">Beacon</placeName> street mall, set out in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This was the mall which <persName n="Holmes,Doctor,,,," id="n0305.0001.00003.00009" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,William,B.,,:9"><roleName n="Doctor">Doctor</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> so loved, where the <rs>Autocrat</rs> and the <name>Schoolmistress</name> were walking that famous morning when <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> they decided to take the <q direct="unspecified">long path</q> for life, together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This mall was also the scene of the farewell parade of the regiment which afterward covered itself and its young commander with glory at the siege of <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName>, an event which is now fittingly commemorated by a magnificent bronze bas-relief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Several old trees once stood :close about the <name>Common</name>, planted probably soon after those <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ordinances for the purpose.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Opposite the <rs>Old Granary Burying Ground</rs> stood a row of fine trees, which originally formed an avenue known as <persName n="Paddock,,,,," id="n0305.0001.00004.00012" reg="nearbymention:Paddock,Adino,,,"><surname>Paddock</surname></persName>'s Mall, which were planted in <dateStruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Some of them survived until <dateStruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></dateStruct>, when they were removed, an act which excited the indignation of <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0305.0001.00004.00014" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,H.,W.,,:1"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>, and doubtless others, when he read in the morning paper the news of the felling of the last of the <name>Paddock</name> elms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>An elm, believed to have been <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>Paddock</name> elms transplanted, was sacrificed in the location of the <rs type="place">Congregational building</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Had it been within the <rs>Granary Burying Ground</rs>, perhaps it might have been saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>There is the contemplated division of the <num value="2">two</num>, sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The publick buildings and offices are all located at the extremity of the peninsula, and the inconvenience of this to the western section must be apparent to every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The number of inhabitants in this section will not vary much from <num value="1000">1,000</num>, and although the <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> number is small in comparison with the territory, yet when we consider its vicinity to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, its other natural and local advantages, this I think cannot be considered as an objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>The extent and singular form of this town running <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> into the country, land almost encircled by <num value="4">four</num> other townships, whilst the principal part of the population are confined to the eastern extremity, cannot, we think, but impress every mind with the necessity of a division.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>But these are considerations of but little importance in the eye of your petitioners, in comparison with others, the consequence of this; unnatural connection in which our interests are deeply involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We contend and we expect to prove to the satisfaction of the committee that we pay into the town treasury a much larger amount than is expended upon us. This is not idle assertion grounded on loose conjecture the rantings of a heated imagination, but a truth which we conceive to be incontrovertible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>By the assessors books of <dateStruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct>, the amount of taxes in the westerly section amounted to a fraction over <measure n="3500dollars" type="currency">$3,500</measure>. The expenditures in the same section during the same year (according to the printed account and other authentic sources) amounted to somewhat short of <measure n="1100dollars" type="currency">$1,100</measure>. This, the committee will discover, is not <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> part of the amount paid in, but we are aware that there are some other expenditures, such as our proportional part of the salaries of town officers and support of poor, which ought to be taken into this account, but after everything is included which the most scrupulous could suggest, we are confident the result will be decidedly in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>So sure are we of this that we challenge our opponents to prove the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Nor do we admit that we are contending for a trifle, for although we do not pretend that we can accurately ascertain the precise sum which we shall save by this change, yet we are sanguine it will not amount to less than from <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> to <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of our present burthens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>As this is an important point to sustain, I shall proceed to state some of the causes which produce this inequality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The <num value="2">two</num> sections are altogether different in their occupations, views, and habits&mdash;the lone is a seaport, the other an agricultural community: the <num value="1">one</num> by its contiguity with <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> imitates the <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> expenditures of the city, the bother, more frugal in their habits, disclaims all such rivalship; the <num value="1">one</num> has sources of expenditure peculiar to itself, the other participates only in a few of their mutual wants; perhaps it would not be an exaggeration to say that <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of our annual expenditures are devoted to objects in which we have no particular interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Some items of these expenditures which occur yearly are <rs n="night watch" type="product">night watch</rs>, lighting lamps, repair of pumps land <rs n="fire engines" type="product">fire engines</rs>, and those which occasionally occur, the purchase of such articles and a variety of expences to improve and orniment the peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>But this is not all. Apparent as it must be to every mind, from the causes just mentioned, that we are disadvantageously situated in reference to the peninsula, another view of the subject will show that on another point we are suffering by this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>We of the westerly section do not pretend to compete with the eastern in point of wealth, yet even on this subject what says the tax book?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>We pay <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> part of the burthens and yet contain not <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> part of the population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>How can this be, if the easterly section is the most wealthy, without impeaching the integrity of the assessors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>It is simply this, our property is seen land tangible, theirs unseen and therefore difficult to be traced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>We are taxed not only for what we own, but what we have in possession; they from the nature of their property frequently are not taxed to the extent of their wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Under these circumstances, I expect the committee will be surprised, will be astonished that the inhabitants of the westerly section have hot long since appeared at the bar of the <name>Legislature</name> to make known their grievances and to vindicate their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>This is to be attributed to a variety of causes, some of which are the smallness of our numbers, scattered population, local attachments and prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Some of these inequalities are so palpable and apparent that they have long been felt and acknowledged by all; others are of such a nature as to require investigation, but are equally oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>I will now draw the attention of the committee to the particular interests which are conflicting, and leave it to the candor of all to decide whether the suffering party has not the highest claims on the <name>Legislature</name>, not only for support and redress, but for <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> patronage and favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Agriculture or the cultivation of the soil has ever been considered in all ages and in a countries as the grand support and pillar of all governments; it is the aliment on which all the other classes depend and without which the ligaments of civilized society would fall asunder and man revert back again to his original barbarism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>In a government constituted like ours, where the rights of man are fully recognized, based on the principles of equality, it exhibits itself in another amiable point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Its gains being slow but sure if attended with industry and frugality, it keeps up that equality which the constitution recognizes, and which is the beau ideal of theorists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>In this point of view it may be considered as the safeguard of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> and the bulwark of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The commercial and manufacturing interests which we contend (in reference to our little community) are preying upon the vitals of their common father, in a national point of view are doubtless deserving the patronage and protection of government, but no <num value="1">one</num>, I presume, will contend that these interests are more important than that of agriculture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>In fact, wherever there is a conflict of interests in a municipal community, it is idle to pretend that <num value="1">one</num> part of the community should be taxed for the support of the establishments of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>This is so inconsistent in itself, so palpably absurd and unjust that few are to be found who would not be ashamed to avow such a principle, yet to what other cause can we attribute the present opposition to this measure from within the peninsula?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>I know they would endeavor to have a pretense because we are not united to a man in our own section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>But has this any weight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>What right have they to interfere in a question of interest which relates to ourselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>We expect satisfactorily to prove to the committee that this opposition is more in sound than reality; that more than <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the landed property and <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the taxable property are on the side of the petitioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>But admitting it was not so, admitting that we were equally divided upon this subject amongst ourselves, is it for the town of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> to decide which of the <num value="2">two</num> parties are the most disinterested and which the most selfish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>But what course has the town pursued on this subject?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, they <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> agreed to a seperation provided the line of demarkation and the terms and conditions could be settled between the parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>In accordance with this vote, a committee was chosen to confer with a committee of the petitioners to settle these points and to report to the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>After a laborious investigation, the parties agreed, and a report was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The town then, without making any substantial objections to those terms, rejected the report and instructed their representatives to oppose a seperation on any terms whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>I now ask, Where is the consistency, where the sincerity of the town in the course they have pursued?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>If they were determined to oppose us, why did they not take that stand at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and not have added insincerity to opposition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>For as the affair has terminated, can we believe otherwise than that they intended to play upon the credulity of the petitioners?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>That they intended that they should give them a pretense for opposition when they were already from pecuniary motives predisposed to oppose them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>Since the town has shown no substantial reasons why they oppose a seperation, we cannot but attribute it to an admission of <num value="1">one</num> of the committee who had thoroughly investigated the subject, namely, that the westerly section pays into the town treasury annually <measure n="2000dollars" type="currency">$2,000</measure> more than is expended upon them, which goes to support the general municipal concerns of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Whether an argument of this kind ought to have any weight upon this question, I leave it to the good sense of the committee to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>I shall now endeavor to develop some of the motives which actuate the remonstrants upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>In our opinion, the opposition from this quarter can be traced to a particular point,&mdash;<num value="2">two</num> individuals who have long enjoyed (we think from courtecy) certain privileges on a fishing stream are, we think, the backbone of the remonstrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>We do not pretend to say that all who are upon the remonstrance are influenced by these men, but we do contend, and we think truly, had it not been for this fishing stream, the remonstrance upon your table would not have been presented to the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>These individuals, <num value="1">one</num> of which, by the various offices he sustains in the town and his long being a member of the <name>Legislature</name>, has scattered his crude and <num value="1">one</num>-sided opinions far and <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>He has not seemed to hesitate at anything that would further his object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Not only has he roused local prejudices and presented bugbears to the weak, to influence their opinions, but he has made the grossest misrepresentations and descended to the meanest personalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>His course has been that of a factious demagogue engrossed by his own personal views of avarice and ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>At his heels he has carried a train of kindred or dependants, who have yielded to his influence or dread his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>The question then reverts, Shall an insignificant faction thus organized, grounded on ambition and selfishness, defeat an object of general utility, defeat the declared will of a suffering community who have made known their grievances and ask relief?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>It is a peculiar characteristic of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion that it discourages a spirit of conquest in nations and in rulers, and in private life inculcates the milder virtues of humility and forbearance.
