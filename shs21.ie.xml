<p>Many a noble officer, reading such a letter with a poor fellow of his command, at night fall, has realized how inadequate and powerless was the best sympathy and advice and comfort he could give, and when at next morning's roll call, that man failed to answer to his name, has felt far more of pity than of condemnation.

<p>Yes, I was sure of it now. Her eyes had gazed straight into mine&mdash;her head inclined and her eye-lids drooped a little now, and <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> there was something in her face that was not pain and was not fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>So I let myself out a little, and turning to the men, said:</p>

<p>I turned to look at her. It was all over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Her wifehood had conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>She had not been addressed this time, yet she answered instantly, with head raised high, face flushing, eyes flashing.</p>

<p>As she uttered these words, she put her hand in her bosom, and drawing out a folded paper, extended it toward me, saying:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/></p> 
<p>Before her hand reached mine, she drew it back, seeming to have changed her mind&mdash;but I caught her wrist, and, without much resistance on her part, possessed myself of the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>It had been much thumbed and was much worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>It was hardly legible, but I made it out. Again I turned to the men. <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>During the reading of this paper, the woman was transfigured, glorified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>No Madonna of old master was ever more sweetly radiant with all that appeals to what is best and holiest in man. Her bosom rose and fell with deep, quiet sighs&mdash;her eyes rained gentle, happy tears.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>The men felt it <hi rend="italics">all&mdash;all</hi>. They were all gazing upon her, but the dross was clean purified out of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>There was not, upon any <num value="1">one</num> of their faces, an expression that would have brought a blush to the cheek of the purest womanhood on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>I turned once more to the soldier's wife:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Suddenly, with a gasp of recovered consciousness, she snatched the paper from my hand, put it back hurriedly in her bosom, and, turning once more to her mother, said:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>A beneficent <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has mercifully decreed that Time shall be the great healer and consoler of almost every form of human woe. <measure n="5years" type="date">Five years</measure> ago our land was still reeling with the calamities <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> of war. The blood was hardly dry upon the battle-fields, the dead were not yet all buried, the smouldering ruins were still smoking, and the echoes of the closing cannonades had hardly ceased to resound in our ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>All was desolation in the present&mdash;doubt and fear for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>So sudden and so complete had been our fall that we lay stunned beneath the crushing blow, with no strength but to suffer, no energy but to despair!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>But time rolled on and brought healing upon his wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The ruined homesteads have been rebuilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>The ploughshare has turned up the soil enriched by the slaughter of war. The luxuriant grass has covered up the graves of the fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Some years more and a few slight ridges in the plain, a few mutilated trunks in the forest, will alone mark the spot where rose the bristling fortifications and the red-mouthed artillery shot out its thunders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>And not in the material world alone has the gentle hand of time closed the gaping wounds of war. It has also poured its balm in our sorrowing hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>It has soothed the agony of recent bereavement and defeat; it has showed us that we have still a country to live for&mdash;a country which, if we cannot, as we once fondly hoped, raise to power and proud independence, we can still love and render prosperous by the arts of peace, as we made her illustrious, even in defeat, by the fortitude of our struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>And now, though many bitter things are still to be endured and the regrets for what <hi rend="italics">might</hi> have been, can never cease to exist, yet the light of hope shines brighter and brighter before our eyes, and speaks to us of better days in the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>But with time and returning prosperity come also the waters of oblivion, whose rising tide threatens to engulf all the vestiges of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Here and there a stricken heart, wounded to its inmost core, and alone knowing its own bitterness, will cherish its sacred grief until time itself shall be no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>But without a proper effort on our part there is danger that the corroding cares of the present and the absorbing exertions for existence may make us or our descendants forget the rightfulness of our cause, and the heroic martyrs who fell in its defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>And beside all this, upon their fate and history lies there not the blight of failure and defeat?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Those who fall in the arms of victory and success need no monuments to preserve their memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The continued existence and prosperity of their country are sufficient epitaphs, and their names can never be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>But how shall those be remembered who failed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>It is their enemies who write their history&mdash;painting it with <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> their own colors&mdash;distorting it with their calumnies, their prejudices, and their passions, and it is this <num value="1">one</num>-sided version of the conquerors that the world at large accept as the truth, for in history as in the present, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Voe Victis</hi>!</q>&mdash;woe to the conquered!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>It is true that when we, the actors in the late contest, shall be sleeping in our graves little will it matter to us what the world may think of us or our motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>But methinks that we could hardly rest in peace, even in the tomb, should our descendants misjudge or condemn us. And yet, is there no possibility of this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>They will be told that their fathers were oligarchs, aristocrats, slave drivers, rebels, traitors, who, to perpetuate the monstrous sin of human slavery, tried to throttle out the life of the nation, and to rend asunder the government founded by <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0279.0004.00040.00460" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>; that they raised parricidal hands against the sacred ark of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; that they were the unprovoked aggressors, and struck the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sacrilegious blow against the <rs>Union</rs> and the flag of their country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>What if this be but false cant and calumny?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Constant repetition will give it something of the authority of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>We cannot doubt it. Our descendants will see these slanders repeated in Northern and probably in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> publications&mdash;perhaps even in the very text-books of their schools (for unfortunately we Southerners write too little), and they may be compelled, like ourselves, to look abroad for their intellectual nutriment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>It is true that our own immediate sons and daughters will not believe these falsifications of history, but perchance <hi rend="italics">their</hi> children or grandchildren may believe them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>And those who are still our enemies after <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> of peace, rely confidently upon this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>A so-called minister of the <rs>Prince</rs> of Peace, but whose early and persistent advocacy of war and bloodshed prove that he obtained his commission from a very opposite quarter, has dared to say that <q direct="unspecified">in a few years the relatives of those Southern men who fell in our struggle will be ashamed to be seen standing by the side of their dishonored graves.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>And he who said this, mark you, is no obscure driveller, but, on the contrary, <num value="1">one</num> of the highest representative men of the <rs>North</rs>; <num value="1">one</num> whom they delight to honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>No less a personage than <persName n="Beecher,Reverend,Henry,Ward,," id="n0279.0004.00040.00461" reg="default:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Ward</foreName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName>, who tendered his church as a shooting-gallery for bandits to acquire skill to murder Southern men in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>&mdash;Beecher, the abettor and panegyrist of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0279.0004.00040.00462" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, the chief of those bandits&mdash;Beecher, the burning and shining light of the <orgName n="Northern Church" type="church">Northern Church</orgName>, whose utterances attract <num value="1000">thousands</num> every Sabbath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>He says that in a few years the <rs>Southern</rs> <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> people will be ashamed to stand by the dishonored graves of their fallen champions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>Fellow Southerners, whose teachings and influence can accomplish more than all other agencies combined to hurl back this foul slander in the teeth of that reverend liar?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Who can best guard our posterity from the corrupting venom of falsehood?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>Who can so implant the right and justice of our lost cause into their souls as to prevail over all the calumnies of our detractors?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Your hearts reply like mine, <q direct="unspecified">It is the noble, patriotic, unwavering women of the <rs>South</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Yes, let me repeat this last epithet, for it belongs peculiar to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/><hi rend="italics">Unwavering</hi>, true to the right, true to the <rs>South</rs>, in the past and in the present, as they will be in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>This is neither the time nor the place for vapid compliments or fulsome eulogy, and I speak only <q direct="unspecified">the words of truth and soberness,</q> as all of you will testify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>We would be baser than the brutes that perish could we forget what the women of the <rs>South</rs> did to promote the success of our efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>By night and by day they labored with diligent hands to supply the deficiencies of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>They nursed the sick and wounded; they bore sorrows and privations of every kind without a murmur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>What they suffered no tongue, no pen can ever express.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>Yet they never faltered; they never gave up, and they continued to cheer the sinking hearts of their defenders, and to hope against all hope, even when all was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>And see how nobly they have kept their faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>While some men who once did gallant service in the <rs>Southern</rs> armies have, alas, turned false for filthy lucre, where are the renegades among Southern women?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Even we who have preserved our truth unstained, have we not grown colder and more forgetful?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Had it depended upon us alone, is there not much reason to fear that our brothers' bones would still lie unheeded where they fell?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>Not that we have grown indifferent or estranged, but the claims of the living and the anxieties of misfortune have absorbed our attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It is these blessed Southern women, whose tender hearts never forget, that deserve the credit of all that has been done among us to preserve from destruction the remains of our brave comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>Unwearied by all their labors and self-sacrifice during <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of war, they were, like <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at the graves of their beloved dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Therefore; to them we may safely entrust the holy ark of our Southern faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Yes, it is for you, wives, mothers, daughters of the <rs>South</rs>&mdash;it is for you far more than for us, to fashion the hearts and thoughts of our children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>We have neither the time nor the aptitude that you possess for training the infant mind from <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> the beginning and inclining the twig the way the tree should grow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>You are now, or will be some day, the mothers of future generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>See that you transmit to them the traditions and memories of our cause, and of our glorious, if unsuccessful, struggle, that they may in their turn transmit them unchanged to those who succeed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>And let them learn from you that although the same inscrutable <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> that once permitted the <rs>Grecian</rs> cross to go down before the <name>Moslem</name> crescent has decreed that we should yield to Northern supremacy, and that we should fail in our endeavor, yet, for all that, <hi rend="italics">we were right</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>And this points to another great lesson to be instilled into their minds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>The worship of success, no matter how achieved, is but too universal in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>In the <rs>North</rs> it is the great idol of the day. <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> whose luck it was to come upon the stage when they could oppose to the exhausted remnants of the <rs>South</rs> the unlimited resources of the <rs>North</rs>, have been magnified into demi-gods, and receive the daily adorations of the multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>So far does this idolatry blind the <rs>Northern</rs> people that they cannot understand our lack of admiration for the men whose ruthless course deluged our land with blood, and whose tracks were marked by the ashes of our desolate homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Still less can they comprehend the love, veneration, and enthusiasm that we still continue to feel for our own unsuccessful leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>The events of the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> have impressed upon the <rs>Northern</rs> mind that failure is ignominious, and that success, no matter how iniquitous, is the only criterion of right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>It is for you, Southern matrons, to guard your cherished ones against this foul idolatry, and to teach them a nobler and a higher moral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>As far as the eye can reach nothing to be seen but that dreary region of the <rs>Wilderness</rs> in which nature herself looks frowning, even in the jocund days of spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Blackened ruins, tottering chimneys, crumbling fortifications and shattered cannon-wheels alone mark the site where once stood the quiet hamlet of <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Trees riven and shorn a few feet about the ground as if by some gigantic scythe, bushes showing in every twig the fractures caused by some monstrous hail exhibit the terrible traces of artillery and musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>No sweet perfumes of spring flowers here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>To that peculiar acrid smell of the battle-field, never to be forgotten or mistaken by those who have once breathed it; to that mingled odor of burning leaves, fresh blood, and powder smoke has succeeded the far more repulsive scent of corruption and decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>The whole atmosphere is reeking with the putrid emanations from hundreds of dead horses and from <num value="1000">thousands</num> of shallow graves; for, as we ride this <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> over that wasted battle-field of a week ago, at every step we see the skeleton hands and feet washed out by the recent rains and already blackened and fleshless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>Not the pensive sound of holy bells on this Sabbath morning, but the sullen roar of the still unextinguished <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> forest, and the irregular crash of bursting shells as the flames reach and explode them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Such I remember this day <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> ago, on the banks of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName>, on the desolate field of the great battle.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>And yet, you remember, comrades&mdash;for some of you are present here to-day who were with me there&mdash;you well remember that our veterans, inured to all the vicissitudes of a soldier's life, were enjoying the temporary rest after the fierce conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>Our dead had been buried, our wounded transported to more remote hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>Our hopes were buoyant, for though our great leader was prostrated for the present by his wounds, we all looked forward to a time not far distant when he would again lead us to other victories, which would at last bring blessed peace to the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>In the camps of the division when evening came the usual song and jest were heard as before, exhibiting that careless gaiety so gratifying to behold, as indicating a cheerful readiness for all emergencies.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The sun rose cloudless on that Sabbath morning&mdash;obscured only by the smoke of the still smouldering woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>In most of our camps services were held by the chaplains, and attended by the troops in more than usual numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>None but the <name>Omniscient</name> can tell what prayers arose that day&mdash;many from hearts and lips unused to pray for themselves&mdash;on behalf of the beloved chieftain who, at that very moment, was descending into the shadow of the dark valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>But death, which he had so often looked in the face, had no terrors for him. Both for this world and the next he had fought the good fight, he had won the victory; and when in the supreme hour his soul beheld the weird river of death, his last words were: <q direct="unspecified">Let us cross over the river and rest under the trees.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/><num value="1">One</num> minute more and the cold stream was passed, and he rests forever under those heavenly trees whose leaves are for the healing of nations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>The sounds of merriment died away as if the <name>Angel</name> of Death himself had flapped his muffled wings over the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>A silence profound, mournful, stifling and oppressive as a funeral pall succeeded to the voices of cheerfulness, and many were the veterans who had followed him from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> to <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName> to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, whose bronzed cheeks were now wet <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> with burning tears, and whose dauntless breasts were heaving with uncontrollable sobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>Well, my fellow-citizens, oppressed and impoverished as we are, it is in our power to establish for ourselves and our posterity forever as unfading and significant a memorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>Let this day become the national Holy day of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Let it be celebrated each returning year by the prayers of the church for the prosperity of the land for which these martyrs gave their lives, and by the tribute of praise paid by eloquent lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Let young and old repair to these consecrated graves to decorate them with the graceful floral offerings of spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Let these pious and touching ceremonies be so engrafted upon our nation's customs that when our descendants shall ask, like the <name>Hebrew</name> children of old, <q direct="unspecified">What mean ye by this service?</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>And full well do they, whose hallowed dust lies entombed under our feet, deserve all the respect and veneration we can render to their memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Those whose scattered remains have been collected here by our Memorial Association belonged mainly to the rank and file of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Ah! whenever I think of them, the suffering and devoted soldiers of our army, my heart swells with tender and mournful emotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>I have lived with them and known them so well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>It was my fortune during the war to command at various times, troops from no less than <num value="9">nine</num> States of our late Confederacy, and in all of them, I recognized the same noble characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>So intrepid in danger, and yet so gentle, so obedient to those who know how to command them&mdash;so patriotic, so constant and enduring under hardships that can never be adequately described; and I feel a just pride in being able to say that, although always strict in my discipline, never was a single <num value="1">one</num> of our valiant soldiers subjected by any order of mine to a cruel or degrading punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>Yes, while yielding heartily the full meed of glory due to those chiefs whose genius crowned our arms with so many splendid victories, and to that illustrious body of gallant officers whose position and education made it their duty to command, as it was the duty of others to obey, I <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> believe that the rank and file of our troops were, as a mass, the real martyrs of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>The world will never know, never appreciate what they underwent for the vindication of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>To all the unspeakable calamities which inevitably follow in the bloody footsteps of war, were added all those evils resulting from our peculiar position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Cut off from all the world, they daily felt the want of all the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>The want of shoes, when the continual marches tore their bleeding feet; the want of warm clothing, when the pitiless blasts and the driving rains pierced them to the bone; the want of medicine, when the wounds and the diseases of army life stretched them upon the hard hospital bed&mdash;nay, more than this, the want of needful food to enable them to support the exhausting fatigues of war. Yes, fellow Southerners, the world will not credit, and even our own posterity, perhaps, will deem an exaggeration what is but the literal fact, as you well know, you that were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Yes, for more than <num value="2">two</num> long and weary years the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, as a whole, never knew what it was to have enough to eat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Where is another example in all history of an army, neither clothed nor paid, nor more than half fed&mdash;always unsatisfied, always hungering for bread enough, and yet keeping together and battling for more than <num value="2">two</num> lingering years of such unparalleled privations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>And remember how those starving, ragged, barefooted privates marched and toiled and fought, through the burning suns of summer&mdash;through the frozen blasts of winter&mdash;fought until over-powered by irresistible odds, having lost their best blood and the most of their brothers, they yielded at last, less to numbers than to famine, but saving bright and unstained from the fearful ruin their sacred honor, the honor of the <rs>Southern</rs> land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>And who, then, were they, these humble privates, these anonymous heroes, who were content to die unknown, expecting neither reward nor fame?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>Most of them possessed neither lands nor slaves, nor anything worth the risk of their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>But they thought not of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>They gave their lives for their country, their principles, their sacred right to self-government, inherited from the founders of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>Politicians may have been incapable or corrupt&mdash;commanders intemperate or incompetent&mdash;but let us never forget it, the rank and file, when properly led, never failed to do their whole duty as long as human nature could endure, with a heroism that has <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> never been equalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>Nearly the whole of the <num value="2">two</num> regiments were forced from their direct line of retreat and compelled to make a detour, or else stand the chance of running into the enemy, whose columns of attack to our left when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> started were several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> nearer the angle than we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>The General was in great danger, for we were under a lively fire as we formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/>Checking his horse, he threw his hand to his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3578"/>What has caused some confusion has been the fact that almost the same identical thing happened twice during that campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3583"/>It took less time to form that line than it has taken me to tell it. <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> When rising in his stirrups, <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0279.0019.00247.02761" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,John,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> gave the command, <q direct="unspecified">Forward!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3584"/>Guide right!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3585"/></p> 
<p>Those <num value="2">two</num> brigades had a herculean task ahead of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3586"/><num value="30000">Thirty thousand</num> troops, flushed with victory, held formidable works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3587"/>The brigades possibly at that time, for they had already lost heavily since the campaign opened, not more than <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> strong, were about to grapple with this force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3588"/>To <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0279.0019.00247.02762" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s practiced eye it must have seemed a forlorn hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3589"/>How they acquitted themselves the sequel will show.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3590"/>Immediately in front of our brigade was a dense growth of old field pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3591"/>When the order came to move forward, our boys stepped briskly to the front in perfect order, and were soon lost to view in the pine thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3592"/>It was not until we had emerged from the thicket, on the opposite side from us, that we saw the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3593"/>To make our position plainer, I will here state that we were moving in a somewhat oblique line to a line of works which were under construction, and extended from heel to heel of the horseshoe, which contained the works <rs>Johnson</rs> had lost; in other words it was a simple straightening of our line of battle, throwing off the horseshoe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3594"/>As we emerged from the pines we came suddenly upon this inner line, and which was heavily manned by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3595"/>I don't think I exaggerate when I say that the enemy poured a volley into our faces at not over <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards</measure>. It was then, and not till then, that the <q direct="unspecified">rebel yell</q> rose wild and clear upon the morning air. It makes my blood jump quicker as I recall that scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3596"/>Never pausing a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, our boys mounted the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3597"/>In a moment the blue and the gray were mixed in a dense struggling mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3598"/>What must have been <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0279.0019.00247.02763" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s feelings then, as he heard the crashing volley of the enemy, the wild cheer of his boys, and then comparative silence, for the boys were too busy to yell?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3599"/>Soon his practiced ear could detect a receding fire, as the enemy broke in confusion and were driven across the line of the horseshoe, towards <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3600"/>Here they followed the line of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0279.0019.00247.02764" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s work towards the famous <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Angle,,Bloody,,," id="n0279.0019.00247.02765" reg="default:Angle,Bloody,,,"><foreName>Bloody</foreName> <surname>Angle</surname></persName>,</q> our boys in hot pursuit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3601"/>As we advanced up a long slope, the ground gradually rising towards the <q direct="unspecified">bloody angle,</q> we discovered a dense mass of the enemy formed behind a worm fence, which struck <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0279.0019.00247.02766" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s works at right angles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3602"/>Somebody got it into his head that they had surrendered, and officers dashed in amongst our men yelling, <q direct="unspecified">Cease firing, they <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> have surrendered.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3603"/>After some time the firing ceased, but our men continued to advance, every man with his gun cocked and ready to bring it to his shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3604"/>I was reminded of a big bird hunt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3605"/>We were now, I think, in <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> of the mass I speak of, when a shot came from their lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3606"/>As quick as thought our boys blazed away, and raising a yell dashed at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3607"/>In another moment the blue and the gray became a dense, surging mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3608"/>The fighting here was desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3609"/>Pistols, guns, bayonets, swords, all came into play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3610"/>A lieutenant of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA52">Fifty-second Virginia</orgName> was just to my right, almost touching me. I saw him put his hand upon a <name>Yankee</name>'s shoulder, ordering him to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3612"/>I had a loaded revolver in my hand, and <num value="1">1</num> emptied it, in many instances close enough to burn their clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>I recollect thinking during that fight of a remark <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n0279.0019.00248.02767" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> was credited with making, that he had been in a <num value="100">hundred</num> battles and did not know whether he had ever killed a man. I saw then how that might easily happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>When so many bullets are flying it is impossible to say which did the work, and I am glad I did not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3615"/>The enemy broke again, retreating in the direction of the angle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>We were now, I think, probably about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">150 yards</measure> from it, when we became aware of a heavy fire from <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0279.0019.00248.02768" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s old works, and discovered that they were heavily manned by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>Turning from the pursuit of the mass in front of us we charged the works which were now to our left, killing, wounding and capturing everything in them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3618"/>At this juncture of affairs I am satisfied I was in less than <num value="50">fifty</num> steps of the angle, and I am perfectly certain I could have gone to the angle without encountering an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>The officer commanding our brigade that day was, I think, <persName n="Casey,Colonel,,,," id="n0279.0019.00248.02769" reg="mostcommon:Casey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Casey</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedford, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086267">Bedford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3620"/>Finding that our pursuit of the enemy had separated our brigade from the <name>Georgians</name>, he ordered us to close to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3621"/>In doing so, we increased the distance between our left and the angle to probably a <num value="100">hundred</num>, or possibly <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure>. Not long after this movement, about half an hour, I think, a large number of tile enemy made their appearance to our left and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3622"/>Running through the entire length of the <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse shoe</rs>, from toe to heel, was a skirt of timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>Under cover of this the enemy had crossed over at the angle, and passed down the centre about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>, coming out so as to strike our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3624"/>As they made their appearance, a part <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> of our left swung back from the works so as to front the advancing enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3625"/>A small party of us, on the extreme left, thought they were a party cut off, and were coming in to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>We were so sure of it that we stood our ground until they came in <num value="10">ten</num> steps of us. The foremost man was an Irishman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3627"/>He had a cap in <num value="1">one</num> hand and his musket in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3628"/>When he reached the point I have just mentioned, he called out, <q direct="unspecified">Surrinder!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>We soon saw our mistake; <num value="1">one</num> of our party quickly threw his gun to his shoulder, fired at the <name>Irishman</name> and missed him; the <name>Irishman</name> threw his gun up, but before he could fire, another <num value="1">one</num> of our party fired, killing him. We were too close to run, and knew that our men would open, and we would be between <num value="2">two</num> fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>So we dropped flat on the ground, the enemy passing by, and over us-just then our left opened on them, and they came back pell-mell, and as they passed us going back our party jumped up, and gave them a parting shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>It was a close call for us. Had our left given back, we would have gone on to reinforce <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0279.0019.00249.02770" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>This party of the enemy retreated, and crossed the works at the angle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>From that time out, during the entire day, neither side occupied the space between our left and the angle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>About this time <persName n="Casey,Colonel,,,," id="n0279.0019.00249.02771" reg="mostcommon:Casey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Casey</surname></persName> directed me to go in search of <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0279.0019.00249.02772" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,John,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>, or some officer on <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0279.0019.00249.02773" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s staff, and directed me to explain the situation, and ask for reinforcements to fill the vacant space on our left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>I started along the line of works and went towards <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Courthouse">Spotsylvania Courthouse</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/>As I approached the part of our line which was occupied by the <name>Georgians</name>, I noticed that they were all down behind the works, and as I advanced towards them they motioned to me to get down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>I couldn't understand what they meant, until all at once I discovered a line of the enemy lying flat in a tall growth of broom-sedge, which covered an old field in front of the <name>Georgians</name> .Balaam when he saw the angel standing in his way with the flaming sword was not more astonished than I was. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought which passed through my mind was why on earth couldn't I see those fellows?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>They were so close I could almost distinguish <num value="1">one</num> face from another, and why they didn't shoot me is a mystery, unless they thought I wasn't worth the ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3639"/>Under the circumstances I was very willing to overlook the slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>It has been said that <q direct="unspecified">Where ignorance is bliss, 'twere folly to be wise.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/>This was an exception to that rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>Ignorance was undoubtedly bliss in this case, but it would <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> have been very far from folly to have been wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3643"/>It took me very little while to disappear behind the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3644"/>I was now in a dilemma.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3645"/>I couldn't stay there, and after seeing what was out in the sedge I did not relish the idea of again taking the chances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3646"/>After creeping along the works for some distance I found a place where the ground sloped back from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3647"/>Here, by lying flat and working along snake fashion I could keep out of sight until I reached the skirt of timber alluded to above, when I, made good time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>Soon after leaving the <name>Georgians</name> I heard cheering and heavy firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>I think the enemy tried to break over the <name>Georgians</name>, and were driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>After accomplishing what I was sent for I returned to my position on the left of our brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3651"/>During the entire day there was an incessant fire on us, both from infantry and artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3652"/>With the exception of the ground just at the angle the enemy had been driven out of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0279.0019.00250.02774" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s entire line.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>The fire from the <name>Angle</name> annoyed us all day. A party of us went to our commanding officers and volunteered to take it. Our plan was to crawl from <num value="1">one</num> traverse to another (they being from <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <num value="20">twenty</num> steps apart all the way from our left to the angle) until we got up to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>He declined, however, thinking it not worth the risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>I feel sure it could have been done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>In giving my account of this day's work I have not mentioned anything except our own operations, the <name>Georgians</name> being out of sight, but that they did their share I have not the slightest doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>For they could always be depended upon to do as much as any command in our service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>Night closed <num value="1">one</num> of the most disagreeable days I ever spent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>As soon as it was dark we were taken from the horseshoe, and placed in the line I spoke of from heel to heel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>The next day was quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>Although nearly <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of a century ago, the press was alive, and wielded such an influence in the great war that the question as to <q direct="unspecified">which is the most powerful the pen or the sword?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>is as far from settlement as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>The general read us the <rs>Northern</rs> account, in which the army correspondent paid us, I think, a merited compliment when he said: <q direct="unspecified">The fighting of the <rs>Rebels</rs> was simply splendid.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>In his episcopal visits he went into a foreign country perhaps, annually; yet it probably never occurred to him that he passed on these occasions beyond the pale of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> to which he owed allegiance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>Enthusiastic as the bishop was in the cause of secession, his thoughts were turned to active participation in the conflict by an incident from which he and his family alone were sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>When war became a certainty he removed his wife and children from New Orleans to a house at <placeName reg="Sewanee, Franklin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101438">Sewanee, Tennessee</placeName>, on the lands where he had hoped to raise his proposed university, and they were barely settled before the house was burned over their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>The bishop himself wrote: <q direct="unspecified">I am satisfied that it was the work of an incendiary, and that it was prompted by the spirit of black Republican hate.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>Yet, so far as evidence of incendiarism goes, these volumes are so void of it as to suggest the need of a monograph carefully treating the question whether that fire which converted a bishop into a general was not accidental after all. But this wrathful beginning was not followed by hasty acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>The bishop deliberated long before taking up the sword; and when he did take it up he did so with the express determination of laying it down as soon as possible.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4773"/>As the time for his departure drew nigh we knelt in prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4774"/>Just before leaving he took a long lingering look around the walls of the cell, which had been to him <q direct="unspecified">the house of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the gate of Heaven.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4775"/>Then he called to his fellow prisoners, many of them by name, and bade them all an affectionate farewell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4776"/>On reaching the street he asked permission to look into his coffin, which was in the hearse before the door of the jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4777"/>The top was taken off, and he stood for some minutes and looked fondly at the daguerreotypes of his wife and children, which he had directed to be hung up around the inside of the coffin.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4785"/>I thought it was the most Christ-like forgiveness of injuries I had ever witnessed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4786"/>All the way out of the city the streets were filled with an idle crowd, many of whom, however, were mourners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4787"/>The windows of the houses on both sides of the streets were filled with women and children, among whom he recognized many of his patients, and, as they caught sight of him, they would break out into wailing and rush away, and the air was loaded with their bitter cries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/>He was constantly bowing to these, his old friends, and remarked to me: <q direct="unspecified">It is just as well that my mind is occupied in this way.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4789"/>Several times I repeated to him texts of Scripture and verses of hymns, as they occurred to me, among others the <num value="157" type="ordinal">157th</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>He asked the officer, who was in the carriage with us, if his body was to be given up to his friends for burial from the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4792"/>The officer said he had no such instructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4793"/>I told him that the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs> had, the night before, assured me that this request should be complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4794"/>He seemed grieved that it was not to be so, and said he desired that the prayers of the church should be said over his body in the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4795"/>I assured him I would see the <rs>General</rs>, and had no doubt he would order compliance with his request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4796"/>This seemed to satisfy him. It was very touching to hear him, after a few moments silence, repeat, as if to himself, the names of his children.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4797"/>And now, the time of his departure was near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/>He took leave of his clerical friends, embracing each <num value="1">one</num> of us most affectionately.

<p>

The members of the medical profession kept watch from this time till the funeral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4805"/>Hundreds of his patients and friends came into the church to show their respect for his memory, and to drop a tear on his coffin.
