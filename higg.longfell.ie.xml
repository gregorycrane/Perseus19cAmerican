<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>A life of <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0001.00000.00001" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> has been from the beginning included in the plan of the <q direct="unspecified">American Men of Letters</q> series, but it has been delayed through a variety of causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Like all memoirs of this poet, it must rest partly on the material amply furnished by the <q direct="unspecified">Life</q> so admirably prepared by his brother <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> ago, yet it may be well to explain that the present volume will be found marked by <num value="3">three</num> especial characteristics of its own. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, much additional material is here drawn from the manuscript correspondence of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Longfellow,Mrs.,,,," id="n0319.0001.00000.00002" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>, received from her family and bearing upon the poet's early married years and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit to <placeName>Europe</placeName>, during what was undoubtedly the formative period of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Secondly, there is a good deal of material obtained from the manuscript volumes known as the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> Papers</q> and preserved at the <rs type="place">University</rs> Library, elucidating the academical side of <pb n="iv"/> <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0001.00000.00003" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Thirdly, there is a series of extracts from his earlier writings, dating from college days and not hitherto brought together, but showing the origin and growth of his lifelong desire to employ American material and to help the creation of a native literature; the desire which had its final fulfilment in <q direct="unspecified">Evangeline</q> and <q direct="unspecified">Hiawatha.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>These <num value="3">three</num> sources will be found, if the author is not mistaken, to have afforded distinct contributions to our previous knowledge as to <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0001.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s character and work.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The death of <persName n="Longfellow,,Henry,Wadsworth,," id="n0319.0002.00001.00006" reg="default:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Wadsworth</foreName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> made the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> breach in that well-known group of poets which adorned <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and its vicinity so long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to go was also the most widely famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/><persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0319.0002.00001.00007" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:1"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> reached greater depths of thought; <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0319.0002.00001.00008" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,John,Greenleaf,,:1"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> touched the problems of the nation's life more deeply; <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0319.0002.00001.00009" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,:1"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName> came personally more before the public; <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0319.0002.00001.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,John,A.,,:2"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> was more brilliant and varied; but, taking the English-speaking world at large, it was <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0002.00001.00011" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> whose fame overshadowed all the others; he was also better known and more translated upon the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> than all the rest put together, and, indeed, than any other contemporary poet of the English-speaking race, at least if bibliographies afford any test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Add to this that his place of residence was so accessible and so historic, his <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> personal demeanor so kindly, his life so open and transparent, that everything really conspired to give him the highest accessible degree of contemporary fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There was no literary laurel that was not his, and he resolutely declined all other laurels; he had wealth and ease, children and grandchildren, health and a stainless conscience; he had also, in a peculiar degree, the blessings that belong to <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0319.0002.00002.00012" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,William,,,:1"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>'s estimate of old age, &mdash;<q direct="unspecified">honor, love, obedience, troops of friends.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Except for <num value="2">two</num> great domestic bereavements, his life would have been <num value="1">one</num> of absolutely unbroken sunshine; in his whole career he never encountered any serious rebuff, while such were his personal modesty and kindliness that no <num value="1">one</num> could long regard him with envy or antagonism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Among all the sons of song there has rarely been such an instance of unbroken and unstained success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Yet the fact that his death took place <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago may justly raise the question how far this wave of success has followed his memory, or how far the passage of time has impaired his traditional influence; and here we must compare a variety of tests and standards to ascertain the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Some analysis of this kind may well precede any new attempt to delineate his career.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>We cannot yet throw off our literary allegiance to Old England, we cannot yet remove from our shelves every book which is not strictly and truly American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/><name>English</name> literature is a great and glorious monument, built <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> up by the master-spirits of old time, that had no peers, and rising bright and beautiful until its summit is hid in the mists of antiquity.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>We are a plain people, that have had nothing to do with the mere pleasures and luxuries of life: and hence there has sprung up within us a quicksightedness to the failings of literary men, and an aversion to everything that is not practical, operative, and thoroughgoing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Whatever there may be in letters, over which time shall have no power, must be <q direct="unspecified">born of great endeavors,</q> and those endeavors are the offspring of liberal patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Genius, to be sure, must be born with a man; and it is its high prerogative to be free, limitless, irrepressible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Yet how is it moulded by the plastic hand of Nature!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>how are its attributes shaped and modulated, when a genius like <persName n="Canova,,,,," id="n0319.0004.00034.00194" reg="mostcommon:Canova,Anthony,,,:1"><surname>Canova</surname></persName>'s failed in the bust of the <name>Corsican</name>, and amid the splendor of the <rs>French</rs> metropolis languished for the sunny skies and vine-clad hills of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Men may talk of sitting down in the calm and quiet of their libraries, and of forgetting, in the eloquent companionship of books, all the vain cares that beset them in the crowded thoroughfares of life; but, after all, there is nothing which so frees us from the turbulent ambition and bustle of the world, nothing which so fills the mind with great and glowing conceptions, and at the same time so warms the heart with love and tenderness, as a frequent and close communion with natural scenery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The scenery of our own country, too, so rich as it is in everything beautiful and magnificent, and so full of quiet loveliness or of sublime and solitary awe, has for our eyes enchantment, for our ears an impressive and unutterable <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Its language is in high mountains, and in the pleasant valleys scooped out between them, in the garniture which the fields put on, and in the blue lake asleep in the hollow of the hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>There is an inspiration, too, in the rich sky that <q direct="unspecified">brightens and purples</q> o'er our earth, when lighted up with the splendor of morning, or when the garment of the clouds comes over the setting sun.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Our poetry is not in books alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It is in the hearts of those men, whose love for the world's gain,&mdash;for its business and its holiday, &mdash;has grown cold within them, and who have gone into the retirements of Nature, and have found there that sweet sentiment and pure devotion of feeling can spring up and live in the shadow of a low and quiet life, and amid those that have no splendor in their joys, and no parade in their griefs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Thus shall the mind take color from things around us,&mdash;from them shall there be a genuine birth of enthusiasm,&mdash;a rich development of poetic feeling, that shall break forth in song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Though the works of art must grow old and perish away from earth, the forms of nature shall keep forever their power over the human mind, and have their influence upon the literature of a people.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>For my part I have already hinted to you what would best please me.

<p>We repeat, then, that we wish our native poets would give a more national character to their writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>In order to effect this, they have only to write more naturally, to write from their own feelings and impressions, from the influence of what they see around them, and not from any preconceived notions of what poetry ought to be, caught by reading many books and imitating many models.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>This is peculiarly true in descriptions of natural scenery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>In these, let us have no more sky-larks and nightingales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>We wish, too, to see the figures and imagery of poetry a little more characteristic, as if drawn from nature and not from books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>The world considers grief unmanly, and is suspicious of that sorrow, which is expressed by words and outward signs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>The fact is a source of great sorrow to your friends and of no less embarrassment to the <name>Corporation</name> of the <rs type="place">College</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>The granting the leave of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> absence was effected, not without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>It was on this fact, and on this assurance alone, that assent of the <name>Corporation</name> was obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>An illustration of this reactionary tendency may be found in a letter addressed by <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0016.00178.00831" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,W.,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> to the <rs>President</rs> and Fellows, placing him distinctly on the side of freedom of choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>The supplement is <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> in some respects better edited than the original, because it gives the names of the translators, and because he had some better translators to draw upon, especially <persName n="Rossetti,,,,," id="n0319.0017.00190.00859" reg="mostcommon:Rossetti,Dante,G.,,:1"><surname>Rossetti</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>It can be said fairly of the whole book that it is intrinsically <num value="1">one</num> of the most attractive of a very unattractive class, a book of which the compiler justly says that, in order to render the literary history of the various countries complete, <q direct="unspecified">an author of no great note has sometimes been admitted, or a poem which a severer taste would have excluded.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>But friends and guests and children and college lectures had more and more filled up his time, so that he had no strength for poetry, and the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> had been very unproductive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>There was, moreover, all the excitement of his friend <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0319.0018.00206.00955" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s career, and of the fugitive slave cases in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and it is no wonder that he writes in his diary, with his usual guarded moderation, <q direct="unspecified">I am not, <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> however, very sure as to the result.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>He had been anxious for some years to carry out his early plan of works upon American themes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>He had, as will be remembered, made himself spokesman for the <name>Indians</name> on the college platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>His list of proposed subjects had included as far back as <dateStruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></dateStruct>, <q direct="unspecified">Tales of the <rs>Quoddy Indians</rs>,</q> with a description of Sacobezon, their chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>After <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> he wrote in his diary (<dateStruct value="1854-06-22"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="22">22</day>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>), <q direct="unspecified">I have at length hit upon a plan for a poem on the <rs>American Indians</rs> which seems to be the right <num value="1">one</num> and the only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>It is to weave together their <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> beautiful traditions into a whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>I have hit upon a measure, too, which I think the right <num value="1">one</num> and the only <num value="1">one</num> for the purpose.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>He had to draw for this delineation not merely upon the <name>Indians</name> seen in books, but on those he had himself observed in <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, the <name>Sacs</name> and Foxes he had watched on Boston Common, and an Ojibway chief whom he had entertained at his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>As for the poetic measure, a suitable <num value="1">one</num> had just been suggested to him by the <name>Finnish</name> epic of <q direct="unspecified">Kalevala,</q> which he had been reading; and he had been delighted by its appropriateness to the stage character to be dealt with and the type of legend to be treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/><q direct="unspecified">Hiawatha</q> was begun on <dateStruct value="1854-06-25"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, and published on <dateStruct value="-11-10"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="10">10</day></dateStruct> of that year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>He enjoyed the work thoroughly, but it evidently seemed to him somewhat tame before he got through, and this tendency to tameness was sometimes a subject of criticism with readers; but its very simplicity made the style attractive to children and gave a charm which it is likely always to retain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>With his usual frankness, he stated at the outset that the metre was not original with him, and it was of course a merit in the legends that they were not original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>The book received every form of attention; it was admired, laughed at, parodied, set to music, and publicly read, and his fame unquestionably rests far more securely on this <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> and other strictly American poems than on the prolonged labor of the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Legend,,Golden,,," id="n0319.0018.00209.00958" reg="default:Legend,Golden,,,"><foreName>Golden</foreName> <surname>Legend</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>The theme had crossed his mind in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, and he had begun to treat it in dramatic form and verse, under the name it now bears; but after a year's delay he tried it again under the name of <persName n="Priscilla,,,,," id="n0319.0018.00210.00967" reg="mostcommon:Priscilla,nomatch:0"><surname>Priscilla</surname></persName>, taking the name, possibly, from an attractive <persName n="Quakeress,,English,,," id="n0319.0018.00210.00968" reg="default:Quakeress,English,,,"><foreName>English</foreName> <surname>Quakeress</surname></persName>, <persName n="Green,,Priscilla,,," id="n0319.0018.00210.00969" reg="default:Green,Priscilla,,,"><foreName>Priscilla</foreName> <surname>Green</surname></persName>, whose sweet voice had charmed him in a public meeting, <q direct="unspecified">breaking now and then,</q> as he says, <q direct="unspecified">into a kind of rhythmic charm in which the voice seemed floating up and down on wings.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>If this be true, the only question that can be raised is whether this advantage has been won by a sacrifice of that degree of literalness which may fairly be demanded of a translation in poetic form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>Perfect and absolute literalness, it must be remembered, can only be expected of a prose version, and even after the most perfect metrical translation a prose version may be as needful as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>Let us consider for a moment the <num value="2">two</num> examples as given above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>It may be conceded at the outset that the adverb <hi rend="italics">gia</hi> is more strictly and carefully rendered by <q direct="unspecified">ere</q> than by <q direct="unspecified">oft,</q> but the difference is not important, as any <num value="1">one</num> old enough to describe a daybreak has undoubtedly seen more than <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>The difference between <q direct="unspecified">the approach of day</q> and <q direct="unspecified">as day began</q> is important, since the last moment of the approach coincides with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment of the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, <q direct="unspecified">la parte oriental</q> is both more literally and more tersely rendered by <q direct="unspecified">the orient sky,</q> than by the more awkward expression <q direct="unspecified">the eastern hemisphere,</q> unless it be claimed that <q direct="unspecified">sky</q> does not sufficiently recognize the earth as seen <pb id="p.231" n="231"/> in the view; to which it may justly be replied that the word <q direct="unspecified">hemisphere,</q> if applied only to the earth, equally omits the sky, and the <num value="2">two</num> defects balance each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/><q direct="unspecified">Tinged with rose</q> is undoubtedly a briefer expression for the untranslatable <q direct="unspecified">rosata</q> than <q direct="unspecified">stained with roseate hues</q> would be. The last line of the <num value="3">three</num> finds an identical rendering in the <num value="2">two</num> versions, and while <q direct="unspecified">bel sereno</q> is more literally rendered by <q direct="unspecified">fair serene</q> than by <q direct="unspecified">light serene,</q> yet the earlier phrase has the advantage of being better <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0319.0021.00231.01050" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, serene being there used as an adjective only, whereas in the later translation it is used as a noun, a practice generally regarded as obsolete in the dictionaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>Even where the word is thus employed, they tell us, it does not describe the morning light, but indicates, like the <rs>French</rs> word <q direct="unspecified">serein,</q> an evening dampness; as where <persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n0319.0021.00231.01051" reg="mostcommon:Daniel,nomatch:0"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName> says, <q direct="unspecified">The fogs and the serene offend us.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>Summing up the comparison, so far as this <num value="1">one</num> example goes, it would seem that the revised version of <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0021.00231.01052" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> has but very slight advantage over its predecessor, while the loss of vividness and charm is unquestionable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>To carry the test yet farther, let us compare the <num value="3">three</num> lines, in their <num value="2">two</num> successive versions, with the prose version of <persName n="Norton,Professor,,,," id="n0319.0021.00231.01053" reg="mostcommon:Norton,Andrews,,,:4"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Norton</surname></persName>, which reads as follows: <q direct="unspecified">I have seen ere now at the beginning of the day the eastern region all rosy, <pb id="p.232" n="232"/> while the rest of heaven was beautiful with fair, clear sky.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>Here the prose translator rightly discards the <q direct="unspecified">oft</q> of the earlier <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0021.00232.01054" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> version, but his <q direct="unspecified">at the beginning</q> is surely nearer to the <q direct="unspecified">at the approach</q> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> version than to the less literal <q direct="unspecified">as day began</q> of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>The prose <q direct="unspecified">the eastern region</q> conforms to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> version <q direct="unspecified">the eastern hemisphere,</q> but surely the <rs>Italian</rs> <q direct="unspecified">la parte oriental</q> is more nearly met by <q direct="unspecified">the orient sky</q> than by either of these heavier and more geographical substitutes, which have a flavor of the text-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>Both the <rs>Longfellow</rs> versions have <q direct="unspecified">the other heaven,</q> which is a literal rendering of <q direct="unspecified">l'altro ciel,</q> whereas <q direct="unspecified">the rest of heaven</q> is a shade looser in expression, and <q direct="unspecified">fair, clear sky</q> also forfeits the condensation of <q direct="unspecified">light serene</q> or <q direct="unspecified">fair serene,</q> of which <num value="2">two</num> phrases the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seems the better, for reasons already given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>On the whole, if we take <persName n="Norton,Professor,,,," id="n0319.0021.00232.01055" reg="mostcommon:Norton,Andrews,,,:4"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Norton</surname></persName>'s prose translation as the standard, <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0021.00232.01056" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s later version seems to me to gain scarcely anything upon the earlier in literalness, while it loses greatly in freshness and triumphant joyousness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>Nor is this in any respect an unreasonable criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>For what does a translation exist, after all, if not to draw us toward that quality in the original which the translator, even at his <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> best, can rarely reach?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>dear Sir,&mdash;Since it will be a satisfaction to me to express my delight in the success of your poem, you cannot well deny me the privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>When I heard the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> announcement of it as for coming, I said, <q direct="unspecified">Well, it is the grandest of all subjects; why has it never been attempted?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>The greater and the more delightful is my surprise at the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>You have managed the theme with really wonderful address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>The episodes, and the hard characters, and the partly imaginary characters, you had <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> your liberty in; and you have used them well to suffuse and flavor and poetize the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>And yet, I know not how it is, but the part which <hi rend="italics">finds</hi> me most perfectly, and is, in fact, the most poetic poetry of all, is the prose-poem,&mdash;the nearly rhythmic transcription of the simple narrative matter of the gospels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>Perhaps the true account of it may be that the handling is so delicately reverent, intruding so little of the poet's fine thinking and things, that the reverence incorporate promotes the words and lifts the ranges of the sentiment; so that when the reader comes out at the close, he finds himself in a curiously new kind of inspiration, born of modesty and silence.</p>

I am afraid I cannot fulfil the promise made for me of making a speech on this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>Not that there are wanting materials for a speech; there are materials of the richest description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>There are, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, the high character, the refinement, and the personal charm of the late illustrious poet,&mdash;if I may say so in the presence of those so near and so dear to him. There are also the characteristics of those works which have secured for him not a greater popularity in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> themselves than in this island and in all the English-speaking dependencies of the <rs>British Empire</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>There are, besides, very large views with regard to the literature which is common to both the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and ourselves, and with regard to the separate branches of literature which have sprung up in each country, and which act and react with so much advantage <num value="1">one</num> upon another; and there are, above all, those relations of a moral and intellectual character which become bonds stronger and greater every day between the intellectual and cultivated classes of these <num value="2">two</num> great countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>I am <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> happy to say that with such materials there are persons here infinitely more fitted to deal than I could have been even if I had had time to bestow upon the thought and the labor necessary to condense into the limits of a speech some of the considerations I have mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>I am glad that among those present there is <num value="1">one</num> who is not only the official representative of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but who speaks with more authority than any <num value="1">one</num> with regard to the literature and intellectual condition of that country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>I cannot but say how glad I am that I have been present at <num value="2">two</num> of the meetings held to inaugurate this work, and I am delighted to be present here to take part in the closing ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>With the greatest pleasure I make the offer of this memorial to the <name>Sub</name>-<persName n="Dean,,,,," id="n0319.0023.00251.01139" reg="mostcommon:Dean,nomatch:0"><surname>Dean</surname></persName>; and from the kindness we have received already from the authorities of <persName n="Abbey,,Westminster,,," id="n0319.0023.00251.01140" reg="default:Abbey,Westminster,,,"><foreName>Westminster</foreName> <surname>Abbey</surname></persName>, I have no doubt it will be received in the same spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>Having occasion to speak in this place some <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, I remember that I then expressed the hope that some day or other the <name>Abbey</name> of <placeName reg="Westminster, Carroll, Maryland" key="tgn,2049138">Westminster</placeName> would become the <name>Valhalla</name> of the whole Englishspeak-ing race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>I little expected then that a beginning would be made so soon,&mdash;a beginning at once painful and gratifying in the highest degree to myself,&mdash;with the bust of my friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>Though there be no Academy in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> which corresponds to that of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, yet admission to <persName n="Abbey,,Westminster,,," id="n0319.0023.00252.01146" reg="default:Abbey,Westminster,,,"><foreName>Westminster</foreName> <surname>Abbey</surname></persName> forms a sort of posthumous test of literary eminence perhaps as effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> of us has his own <persName n="Valhalla,Private,,,," id="n0319.0023.00252.01147" reg="mostcommon:Valhalla,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Private">private</roleName> <surname>Valhalla</surname></persName>, and it is not apt to be populous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>But the conditions of admission to the <name>Abbey</name> are very different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>We ought no longer to ask why is so-and-so here, and we ought always to be able to answer the question why such a <num value="1">one</num> is not here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>I think that on this occasion I should express the united feeling of the whole English-speaking race in confirming the choice which has been made,&mdash;the choice of <num value="1">one</num> whose name is dear to them all, who has inspired their lives and consoled their hearts, and who has been admitted to the fireside of all of them as a familiar friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>Nearly <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago I had occasion, in speaking of <persName n="Longfellow,Mister,,,," id="n0319.0023.00252.01148" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>, to suggest an analogy between him and the <rs>English</rs> poet <persName n="Gray,,,,," id="n0319.0023.00252.01149" reg="mostcommon:Gray,J.,C.,,:1"><surname>Gray</surname></persName>; and I <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> have never since seen any reason to modify or change that opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>There are certain very marked analogies between them, I think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>In the first place, there is the same love of a certain subdued splendor, not inconsistent with transparency of diction; there is the same power of absorbing and assimilating the beauties of other literature without loss of originality; and, above all, there is that genius, that sympathy with universal sentiments and the power of expressing them so that they come home to everybody, both high and low, which characterize both poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>There is something also in that simplicity,&mdash;simplicity in itself being a distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>But in style, simplicity and distinction must be combined in order to their proper effect; and the only warrant perhaps of permanence in literature is this distinction in style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>It is something quite indefinable; it is something like the distinction of good-breeding, characterized perhaps more by the absence of certain negative qualities than by the presence of certain positive ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>But it seems to me that distinction of style is eminently found in the poet whom we are met here in some sense to celebrate to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>This is not the place, of course, for criticism; still less is it the place for eulogy, for eulogy is but too often disguised apology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>But I have been struck particularly&mdash;if I may bring <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> forward <num value="1">one</num> instance&mdash;with some of my late friend's sonnets, which seem to me to be some of the most beautiful and perfect we have in the language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>His mind always moved straight towards its object, and was always permeated with the emotion that gave it frankness and sincerity, and at the same time the most ample expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>It seems that I should add a few words&mdash;in fact, I cannot refrain from adding a few words&mdash;with regard to the personal character of a man whom I knew for more than <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, and whose friend I was honored to call myself for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>. Never was a private character more answerable to public performance than that of <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0023.00254.01150" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>Never have I known a more beautiful character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>I was familiar with it daily,&mdash;with the constant charity of his hand and of his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>His nature was consecrated ground, into which no unclean spirit could ever enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>I feel entirely how inadequate anything that I can say is to the measure and proportion of an occasion like this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>But I think I am authorized to accept, in the name of the people of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, this tribute to not the least distinguished of her sons, to a man who in every way, both in public and private, did honor to the country that gave him birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>I cannot add anything more to what was so well said in a few words by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName>, for I do not <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> think that these occasions are precisely the times for set discourses, but rather for a few words of feeling, of gratitude, and of appreciation.</q></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>He could conceive that if the great poet were allowed to look down on the transactions of that day, he would not think it unsatisfactory that his memorial had been placed in that great <persName n="Abbey,,,,," id="n0319.0023.00255.01152" reg="nearbymention:Abbey,Westminster,,,"><surname>Abbey</surname></persName> among those of his brothers in poetry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>The <rs>Chancellor</rs> of the <name>Exchequer</name> moved a vote of thanks to the honorary secretary and the honorary treasurer, and said he thought he had been selected for the duty because he had spent <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of his life in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and a still longer time in some of the <rs>British</rs> colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>It gave him the greater pleasure to do this, having known <persName n="Longfellow,Mister,,,," id="n0319.0023.00255.01153" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and having from boyhood enjoyed his poetry, which was quite as much appreciated in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and her dependencies as in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>Wherever he had been in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and where-ever he had met <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0319.0023.00255.01154" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, he had found there was <num value="1">one</num> place at least which they looked upon as being as much theirs as it was <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s&mdash;that place was the <rs type="place">Abbey Church</rs> of <placeName reg="Westminster, Carroll, Maryland" key="tgn,2049138">Westminster</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/><pb id="p.256" n="256"/> It seemed, therefore, to him that the present occasion was an excellent beginning of the recognition of the <name>Abbey</name> as what it had been called, &mdash;the <name>Valhalla</name> of the English-speaking people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>He trusted this beginning would not be the end of its application in this respect.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>There is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the familiar fact that to-day we are adding another name to the great roll of illustrious men whom we commemorate within these walls, that we are adding something to that rich heritage which we have received of national glory from our ancestors, and which we feel bound to hand over to our successors, not only unimpaired, but even increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>There is then the novel and peculiar fact which attaches to the erection of a monument here to the memory of <persName n="Longfellow,,Henry,,," id="n0319.0023.00256.01156" reg="default:Longfellow,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>In some sense, poets&mdash;great poets like him&mdash; may be said to be natives of all lands; but never before have the great men of other countries, however brilliant and widespread their fame, been admitted to a place in <persName n="Abbey,,Westminster,,," id="n0319.0023.00256.01157" reg="default:Abbey,Westminster,,,"><foreName>Westminster</foreName> <surname>Abbey</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>A century ago <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> was just commencing her perilous path of independence and selfernment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>Is there not in this a very significant fact; is it not an emphatic proof of the oneness which belongs to our common race, and of the community of our national glories?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>Such a tendency has been traced in this volume from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> childish poetry through his chosen theme for a college debate, his commencement oration, his plans formed during a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> foreign trip, and the appeal made in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> really original paper in the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="North American Review" type="newspaper">North American Review</orgName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>All these elements of aim and doctrine were directly and explicitly American, and his most conspicuous poems, <q direct="unspecified">Evangeline,</q> <q direct="unspecified">The Courtship of Miles Standish,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Hiawatha,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">The <rs type="place">Wayside Inn</rs>,</q> were unequivocally American also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>In the group of poets to which he belonged, he was the most travelled and the most cultivated, in the ordinary sense, while <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0319.0024.00258.01160" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,John,Greenleaf,,:1"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> was the least so; and yet they are, as we have <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> seen, the <num value="2">two</num> who&mdash;in the English-speaking world, at least&mdash;hold their own best; the line between them being drawn only where foreign languages are in question, and there <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0024.00259.01161" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> has of course the advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>In neither case, it is to be observed, was this Americanism trivial, boastful, or ignoble in its tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>It would be idle to say that this alone constitutes, for an American, the basis of fame; for the high imaginative powers of <persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0319.0024.00259.01162" reg="mostcommon:Poe,Edgar,A.,,:1"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>, with his especial gift of melody, though absolutely without national flavor, have achieved for him <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> fame, at least in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, this being due, however, mainly to his prose rather than to his poetry, and perhaps also the result, more largely than we recognize, of the assiduous discipleship of a single Frenchman, just as <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0319.0024.00259.01163" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:2"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s influence in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> was due largely to <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0319.0024.00259.01164" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:1"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>Be this as it may, it is certain that the hold of both <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0319.0024.00259.01165" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> and <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0319.0024.00259.01166" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,John,Greenleaf,,:1"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> is a thing absolutely due, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to the elevated tone of their works, and secondly, that they have made themselves the poets of the people.
