<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>That <num value="1">one</num> was standing in <dateStruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></dateStruct> is inferred from references on the town books to repairs made thereon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>But the more I think of it, the more inclined I am to believe that, being a relic of earlier days, this <q direct="unspecified">block house</q> would naturally be located in the outskirts of such a community as we imagine this <num value="1">one</num> was. Another thing which seems to favor the theory that it may have stood on <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName> soil is the fact that some of the committee for making the necessary repairs were men who lived in this part of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>.
