<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I do not know when I have been more surprised than on being asked, the other day, whether <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00003.00002" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> was not physically very small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>It seemed at the moment utterly unconceivable that he should have been any thing less than the sombre and commanding personage he was. <persName n="Ellery Channing,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00003.00003" reg="mostcommon:Ellery Channing,nomatch:0"><surname>Ellery Channing</surname></persName> well describes him as a <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/></p><l>Tall, compacted figure, ably strung,</l> <l>To urge the <rs>Indian</rs> chase, or point the way.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/><num value="1">One</num> can imagine any amount of positive energy that of <persName n="Bonaparte,,Napoleon,,," id="n0216.0002.00003.00004" reg="default:Bonaparte,Napoleon,,,"><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>, for instance &mdash; as included within a small physical frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>But the self-contained purpose of <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00003.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>, the large resources, the waiting power,--these seem to the imagination to imply an ample basis of physical life; and certainly his stately and noble port is <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> inseparable, in my memory, from these characteristics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Vivid as this impression is, I yet saw him but twice, and never spoke to him. I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met him on a summer morning, in <placeName reg="Concord, Merrimack, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013647">Concord</placeName>, as he was walking along the road near the Old Manse, with his wife by his side, and a noble-looking baby-boy in a little wagon which the father was pushing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>I remember him as tall, firm, and strong in bearing; his wife looked pensive and dreamy, as she indeed was, then and always; the child was <persName n="Julian,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00004.00006" reg="mostcommon:Julian,nomatch:0"><surname>Julian</surname></persName>, then known among the neighbors as <quote><rs type="role" reg="Prince">the Prince</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>When I passed, <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00004.00007" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> lifted upon me his great gray eyes, with a look too keen to seem indifferent, too shy to be sympathetic-and that was all. But it comes back to memory like that <num value="1">one</num> glimpse of <persName n="Shelley,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00004.00008" reg="mostcommon:Shelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Shelley</surname></persName> which <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00004.00009" reg="mostcommon:Browning,Elizabeth,Barrett,,:1"><surname>Browning</surname></persName> describes, and which he likens to the day when he found an eagle's feather.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Again I met <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00004.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> at <num value="1">one</num> of the sessions of a short-lived <orgName n="Literary Club" type="club">literary club</orgName>; and I recall the imperturbable dignity and patience with which he sat through a vexatious discussion, whose details seemed as much dwarfed by his presence as if he had been a statue of <persName n="Zeus,,Olympian,,," id="n0216.0002.00004.00011" reg="default:Zeus,Olympian,,,"><foreName>Olympian</foreName> <surname>Zeus</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>After his death I had a brief but intimate acquaintance with that rare person, <persName n="Hawthorne,Mrs.,,,," id="n0216.0002.00004.00012" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>; and with <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> still more finely organized, and born to a destiny of sadness,--their elder daughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>I have staid at <quote>The Wayside,</quote> occupying a room in the small tower built by <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00005.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>, and containing his lofty and then deserted study, which still bore upon its wall the <name>Tennysonian</name> motto, <quote>There is no joy but calm,</quote> --this having been inscribed, however, not by himself, but by his son. It is not my purpose to dwell upon the facts of private life; and these circumstances are mentioned only because it is well to know at what angle of incidence any critic has been touched by the personality of a great author.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Perhaps it always appears to men, as they grow older, that there was rather more of positive force and vitality in their own generation and among their immediate predecessors, than among those just coming on the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This may be the reason why there seems to me a perpetual sense of grasp and vigor in <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00005.00014" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s most delicate sketches; while much of the most graceful writing now done in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> makes no such impression, but either seems like dainty confectionery, or like carving minute heads on cherry-stones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the tendency is just now to the opposite fault,--to a distrust of all nice attention to form in writing, as being necessarily a weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00005.00015" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> happily escaped both these dangerous alternatives; and, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> indeed, it is hard to see that his genius was much affected by his surroundings, after all. He had, to be sure, the conscientious fidelity of <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> in his veins, a thing equally important for literature and for life: without it he might have lavished and wasted himself like <persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00006.00016" reg="mostcommon:Poe,nomatch:0"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>. He had what <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00006.00017" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> once described as <quote>the still living merit of the oldest <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New-England</placeName> families;</quote> <note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> 
<p>The Dial, <num value="3">III</num>.<num value="101">101</num>.</p></note> he had moreover the unexhausted wealth of the <rs>Puritan</rs> traditions,--a wealth to which only he and <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00006.00018" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,nomatch:0"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> have as yet done any justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The value of the material to be found in contemporary American life he never fully recognized; but he was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> person to see that we really have, for romantic purposes, a past; <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> being really quite enough to constitute antiquity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This was what his <quote>environment</quote> gave him, and this was much.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But, after all, his artistic standard was his own: there was nobody except <persName n="Irving,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00006.00019" reg="mostcommon:Irving,nomatch:0"><surname>Irving</surname></persName> to teach him any thing in that way; and <persName n="Irving,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00006.00020" reg="mostcommon:Irving,nomatch:0"><surname>Irving</surname></persName>'s work lay rather on the surface, and could be no model for <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00006.00021" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s. Yet from the time when the latter began to write for <quote>The Token,</quote> at <num value="23">twenty-three</num>, his powers of execution, as of thought, appear to have been full-grown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The quiet ease is there, the pellucid language, the haunting quality: these gifts were born <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> in him; we cannot trace them back to any period of formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>And when we consider the degree to which they were developed, how utterly unfilled remains his peculiar throne; how powerless would be the accumulated literary forces of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, for instance, at this day, to produce a single page that could possibly be taken for <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00007.00022" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s,--we see that there must, after all, be such a thing as literary art, and that he must represent <num value="1">one</num> of the very highest types of artist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Through <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00007.00023" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s journals we trace the mental impulses by which he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> obtained his themes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Then in his unfinished <quote><persName n="Felton,,Septimius,,," id="n0216.0002.00007.00024" reg="default:Felton,Septimius,,,"><foreName>Septimius</foreName> <surname>Felton</surname></persName>,</quote> fortunately unfinished for this purpose,--we see his plastic imagination at work in shaping the romance; we watch him trying <num value="1">one</num> mode of treatment, then modifying it by another; always aiming at the main point, but sometimes pausing to elaborate the details, and at other times dismissing them to be worked out at leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There hangs before me, as I write, a photograph of <num value="1">one</num> of <persName><foreName>Raphael</foreName></persName>'s rough sketches, drawn on the back of a letter: there is a group of heads, then another group on a different scale; you follow the shifting mood of the artist's mind; and so it is in reading <quote><persName n="Felton,,Septimius,,," id="n0216.0002.00007.00025" reg="default:Felton,Septimius,,,"><foreName>Septimius</foreName> <surname>Felton</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In all <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00007.00026" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s completed works, the pencilling is rubbed out, and every trace of the preliminary labor has disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><pb id="p.8" n="8"/></p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the most characteristic of <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00008.00027" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s literary methods is his habitual use of guarded under-statements and veiled hints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is not a sign of weakness, but of conscious strength, when he surrounds each delineation with a sort of penumbra, takes you into his counsels, offers hypotheses, as, <quote>May it not have been?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>or, <quote>Shall we not rather say?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>and sometimes, like a conjurer, urges particularly upon you the card he does not intend you to accept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He seems not quite to know whether <persName n="Dimmesdale,,Arthur,,," id="n0216.0002.00008.00028" reg="default:Dimmesdale,Arthur,,,"><foreName>Arthur</foreName> <surname>Dimmesdale</surname></persName> really had a fiery scar on his breast, or what finally became of <persName><foreName>Miriam</foreName></persName> and her lover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He will gladly share with you any information he possesses, and, indeed, has several valuable hints to offer; but that is all. The result is, that you place yourself by his side to look with him at his characters, and gradually share with him the conviction that they must be real.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Then, when he has you thus in possession, he calls your attention to the profound ethics involved in the tale, and yet does it so gently that you never think of the moral as being obtrusive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>All this involved a trait which was always supreme in him,--a marvellous self-control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He had by nature that gift which the musical composer Jomelli went to a teacher to seek,--<quote>the art of not being embarrassed by his own ideas.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00009.00029" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> told me that her husband grappled alone all winter with <quote>The scarlet letter,</quote> and came daily from his study with a knot in his forehead; and yet his self-mastery was so complete that every sentence would seem to have crystallized in an atmosphere of perfect calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We see the value of this element in his literary execution, when we turn from it to that of an author so great as <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00009.00030" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName>, for instance, and see him often entangled and weighed down by his own rich thoughts, his style being overcrowded by the very wealth it bears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00009.00031" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> never needed Italic letters to distribute his emphasis, never a footnote for assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There was no conception so daring that he shrank from attempting it; and none that he could not so master as to state it, if he pleased, in terms of monosyllables.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>For all these merits he paid <num value="1">one</num> high and inexorable penalty,--the utter absence of all immediate or dazzling success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>His publisher, <persName n="Goodrich,,,,," id="n0216.0002.00009.00032" reg="mostcommon:Goodrich,nomatch:0"><surname>Goodrich</surname></persName>, tells us, in his <quote>Reminiscences,</quote> <note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It has always seemed to me the greatest triumph of his <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> genius, not that he bore poverty without a murmur, -for what right has a literary man, who can command his time and his art, to sigh after the added enjoyments of mere wealth?-but that he went on doing work of such a quality for an audience so small or so indifferent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Whether more immediate applause would have modified the result, it is now impossible to say. Having so much, why should we ask for more?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>An immediate popularity might possibly have added a little more sunshine to his thought, a few drops of redder blood to his style; thus averting the only criticism that can ever be justly made on either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Yet this very privation has made him a nobler and tenderer figure in literary history; and a source of more tonic influence for young writers, through all coming time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It happens to us rarely in our lives to come consciously into the presence of that extraordinary miracle we call genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Among the many literary persons whom I have happened to meet, at home or abroad, there are not half a dozen who have left an irresistible sense of this rare quality; and, among these few, <persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0216.0003.00012.00050" reg="mostcommon:Poe,nomatch:0"><surname>Poe</surname></persName> stands next to <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0216.0003.00012.00051" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,nomatch:0"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> in the vividness of personal impression he produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>There was much curiosity to see him; for his prose-writings had been eagerly read, at least among college-students, and his poems were just beginning to excite still greater attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>After a rather solid and very partisan address by <persName n="Cushing,,Caleb,,," id="n0216.0003.00012.00052" reg="default:Cushing,Caleb,,,"><foreName>Caleb</foreName> <surname>Cushing</surname></persName>, then just returned from his <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> embassy, the poet was introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I distinctly <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> recall his face, with its ample forehead, brilliant eyes, and narrowness of nose and chin; an essentially ideal face, not noble, yet any thing but coarse; with the look of over-sensitiveness which when uncontrolled may prove more debasing than coarseness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It was a face to rivet <num value="1">one</num>'s attention in any crowd, yet a face that no <num value="1">one</num> would feel safe in loving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>I remember that when introduced he stood with a sort of shrinking before the audience, and then began in a thin, tremulous, hardly musical voice, an apology for his poem, and a deprecation of the expected criticism of the <rs>Boston</rs> public; reiterating this in a sort of persistent, querulous way, which did not seem like satire, but impressed me at the time as nauseous flattery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It was not then generally known, nor was it established for a long time after, -even when he had himself asserted it,--that the poet was himself born in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>; and no <num value="1">one</num> can now tell, perhaps, what was the real feeling behind the apparently sycophantic attitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>But the conductor of the leading literary magazine of a nation is very apt to escape this wholesome ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Delicacy of course forbids his admitting any mention of himself, whether for praise or blame, within his own pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Moreover, his leading literary contemporaries are also his contributors; and for them to discuss him freely, even elsewhere, is like publicly debating the character of <num value="1">one</num>'s habitual host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Compare the position, in this respect, of <persName n="Howells,Mister,,,," id="n0216.0005.00032.00176" reg="mostcommon:Howells,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Howells</surname></persName> and <persName n="James,Mister,Henry,,," id="n0216.0005.00032.00177" reg="default:James,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>James</surname>, <genName>Jr.</genName></persName> Their writings are equally conspicuous before the community; their merits <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> are equally marked, and so also are their demerits, real or attributed; yet what a difference in the amount of criticism awarded to each!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Each new book by <persName n="Howells,Mister,,,," id="n0216.0005.00033.00178" reg="mostcommon:Howells,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Howells</surname></persName> is received with an almost monotonous praise, as if it had no individuality, no salient points; while each story by <persName n="James,Mister,,,," id="n0216.0005.00033.00179" reg="nearbymention:James,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>James</surname></persName> is debated through and through the newspapers, as if it were a fresh Waverley novel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>I see no reason for this difference, except that <persName n="Howells,Mister,,,," id="n0216.0005.00033.00180" reg="mostcommon:Howells,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Howells</surname></persName> edits <quote>The <orgName n="Atlantic monthly" type="newspaper">Atlantic Monthly</orgName>,</quote> and that all other American writers are, as it were, sitting at his table, or wishing themselves there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>He must himself regret this result, for he is too essentially an artist not to prize honest and faithful criticism; and it is almost needless to say that his career as an author has been thoroughly modest and free from all the arts of self-praise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The peculiar charm of his prose style has also, doubtless, had its effect in disarming criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>This is attributing to him only what he has been careful to claim for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>He tells his methods very frankly, and his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> literary principle has been to look away from great passions, and rather to elevate the commonplace by minute touches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Not only does he prefer this, but he does not hesitate to tell us sometimes, half jestingly, that it is the only thing to do. <quote>As in literature the true artist will shun the use even of real events if they are of an improbable character, so the sincere observer of man will not desire to look upon his heroic or occasional phases, but will seek him in his habitual moods of vacancy and tiresomeness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>That he has finally escaped this peril, is due to the <hi rend="italics">fact</hi> that his method went, after all, deeper than he admitted: he was not merely a good-natured observer, like Geoffrey Crayon, Gentleman, but he had thoughts and purposes, something to protest against, and something to say.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The truth is, that the modern novel has risen with the advance of democratic society, on the ruins of feudalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Another defect is seen from time to time, when, in criticising some well-known book, he misses its special points of excellence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Take, for instance, his remarks on that masterly and <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> repulsive novel, <quote><persName n="Bovary,Madame,,,," id="n0216.0007.00054.00248" reg="mostcommon:Bovary,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <surname>Bovary</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>There is not a character in modern fiction developed more essentially from within than that of this heroine: all her sins and sorrows are virtually predicted in the early chapters; even <persName n="James,Mister,,,," id="n0216.0007.00054.00249" reg="nearbymention:James,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>James</surname></persName> has to admit that it <quote>could not have been otherwise</quote> <note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>She has just felt a <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> twinge of remorse, after receiving an affectionate letter from her father; when suddenly this commonplace husband is presented to her eyes in a wholly new light,--that of an unappreciated man of genius, who has by a single act won a place among the great surgeons of his time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>All that is left undepraved in her nature is touched and roused by this: she will do any thing, bear any thing, for such a husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The illusion lasts but a few days, and is pitilessly torn away: the husband proves a mere vulgar, ignorant quack, even duller, emptier, more hopeless, than she had dreamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The reaction takes her instantly downward, and with that impulse she sinks to rise no more.
