<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>this biography differs from most works of the kind, in embracing fragments of so many lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00001" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> lived almost entirely for others; and it is a striking illustration of the fact, that I have found it impossible to write his biography without having it consist largely of the adventures of other people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I have not recounted his many good deeds for the mere purpose of eulogizing an honored friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>I have taken pleasure in preserving them in this form, because I cherish a hope that they may fall like good seed into many hearts, and bring forth future harvests in the great field of humanity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Most of the strictly personal anecdotes fell from his lips in familiar and playful conversation with his sister, or his grandchildren, or his intimate friends, and I noted them down at the time, without his knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In this way I caught them in a much more fresh and natural form, than I could have done if he had been conscious of the process.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The narratives and anecdotes of fugitive slaves, which form such a prominent portion of the book, were originally written <pb n="vi"/> by Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00002" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> himself, and published in newspapers, under the title of <q direct="unspecified">Tales of Oppression.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>I have re-modelled them all; partly because I wished to present them in a more concise form, and partly because the principal actor could be spoken of more freely by <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> person, than he could speak of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Moreover, he had a more dramatic way of <hi rend="italics">telling</hi> a story than he had of <hi rend="italics">writing</hi> it; and I have tried to embody his unwritten style as nearly as I could remember it. Where-ever incidents or expressions have been added to the published narratives, I have done it from recollection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The facts, which were continually occurring within Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00003" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>'s personal knowledge, corroborate the pictures of slavery drawn by <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Stowe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Her descriptions are no more fictitious, than the narratives written by Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>She has taken living characters and facts of every-day occurrence, and combined them in a connected story, radiant with the light of genius, and warm with the glow of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>But is a landscape any the less real, because there is sunshine on it, to bring out every tint, and make every dew-drop sparkle?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Who that reads the account here given of <persName n="Benson,,Daniel,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00006" reg="default:Benson,Daniel,,,"><foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>Benson</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Anderson,,William,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00007" reg="default:Anderson,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, can doubt that slaves are capable of as high moral excellence, as has ever been ascribed to them in any work of fiction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Who that reads <persName><foreName>Zeke</foreName></persName>, and the <rs>Quick Witted Slave</rs>, can pronounce them a stupid race, unfit for freedom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Who that reads the adventures of the <rs>Slave Mother</rs>, and of poor <persName n="Manuel,,,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Manuel,nomatch:0"><surname>Manuel</surname></persName>, a perpetual mourner for his enslaved children, can say that the bonds of nature are less <pb n="vii"/> strong with them, than with their more fortunate white brethren?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Who can question the horrible tyranny under which they suffer, after reading The Tender Mercies of a Slaveholder, and the suicide of Romaine?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0001.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> labored zealously for many, many years; and <num value="1000">thousands</num> have applied their best energies of head and heart to the same great work; yet the slave-power in this country is as strong as ever&mdash;nay, stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Its car rolls on in triumph, and priests and politicians outdo each other in zeal to draw it along, over its prostrate victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But, lo!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>from under its crushing wheels, up rises the bleeding spectre of <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, and all the world turns to look at him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Verily, the slave-power is strong; but <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and truth are stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>While their house was being built, they took shelter for a few days, in a meeting-house that was little used, and dug a pit for a temporary cellar, according to the custom of new settlers in the forest.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> was early remarked as a very precocious child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He was always peeping into everything, and inquiring about everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>He was only <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> old, when the new log-house was built; but when he saw them laying the foundation, his busy little mind began to query whether the grass would grow under it; and straightway he ran to see whether grass grew under the floor of the hen-house where he was born.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>He was put to work on the farm as soon as he could handle a hoe; but though he labored hard, he <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> had plenty of time and strength left for all manner of roguery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>While he was a small fellow in petticoats, he ran into a duck-pond to explore its depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>His mother pulled him out, and said, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, if you ever go there again, I will make you come out faster than you went in.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>So into the pond he went, as soon as the words were out of her mouth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>A girl by the name of <persName n="Polly,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00004.00079" reg="mostcommon:Polly,nomatch:0"><surname>Polly</surname></persName> assisted about the housework.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>She was considered <num value="1">one</num> of the family, and always ate at the same table, according to the kindly custom of those primitive times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>She always called her mistress <q direct="unspecified">Mammy,</q> and served her until the day of her death; a period of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>His mother went out immediately to ascertain whether the girl was seriously injured.&mdash; <q direct="unspecified">Oh, mammy, that little rogue tickled the cow, and made her do it,</q> exclaimed <persName n="Polly,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00005.00082" reg="mostcommon:Polly,nomatch:0"><surname>Polly</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Whereupon, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> had a spanking, and was sent to bed without his supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>When he was <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old, his uncle's wife came <num value="1">one</num> day to the house on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>She was a fat, clumsy woman, and got on and off her horse with difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> knew that all the family were absent; but when he saw her come ambling along the road, he took a freak not to tell her of it. He let down the bars for her; she rode up to the horse-block with which every farm-house was then furnished, rolled off her horse, and went into the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>She then discovered, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, that there was no <num value="1">one</num> at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>After resting awhile, she mounted to depart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>But <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, as full of mischief as Puck, put the bars up, so that she could not ride out. In vain she coaxed, scolded, and threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Finding it was all to no purpose, she rode up to the block and rolled off from her horse again.&mdash; <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, having the fear of her whip before his eyes, ran and hid himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>She let down the bars for herself, but before she could remount, the mischievous <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> urchin had put the bars up again and run away.&mdash; This was repeated several times; and the exasperated visitor could never succeed in catching her tormentor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>His parents came home in the midst of the frolic, and he had a sound whipping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>He had calculated upon this result all the time, and the uneasy feeling had done much to mar his sport; but on the whole, he concluded such rare fun was well worth a flogging.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The boys at school were apt to neglect their lessons while they were munching apples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>In order to break up this disorderly habit, the master made it a rule to take away every apple found upon them.&mdash; He placed such forfeited articles upon his desk, with the agreement that any boy might have them, who could succeed in abstracting them without being observed by him. <num value="1">One</num> day, when a large rosy-cheeked apple stood temptingly on the desk, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> stepped up to have his pen mended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>He stood very demurely at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but soon began to gaze earnestly out of the window, behind the desk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The master inquired what he was looking at. He replied, <q direct="unspecified">I am watching a flock of ducks trying to swim on the ice. How queerly they waddle and slide about!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/><q direct="unspecified">Ducks swim on ice!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>exclaimed the schoolmaster; and he turned to observe such an unusual spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>It was only for an instant; but the apple meanwhile was transferred to the pocket of his cunning pupil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>He <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> smiled as he gave him his pen, and said, <q direct="unspecified">Ah, you rogue, you are always full of mischief!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/></p> 
<p>The teacher was accustomed to cheer the monotony of his labors by a race with the boys during play hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>There was a fine sloping lawn in front of the school-house, terminating in a brook fringed with willows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The declivity gave an impetus to the runners, and as they came among the trees, their heads swiftly parted the long branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> tied a brick-bat to <num value="1">one</num> of the pendant boughs, and then invited the master to run with him. He accepted the invitation, and got the start in the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>As he darted through the trees, the brick merely grazed his hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>If it had hit him, it might have cost him his life; though his mischievous pupil had not reflected upon the possibility of such a result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>There was a bridge across the brook consisting of a single rail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/><num value="1">One</num> day, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> sawed this nearly in <num value="2">two</num>; and while the master was at play with the boys, he took the opportunity to say something very impertinent, for which he knew he should be chased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>He ran toward the brook, crossed the rail in safety, and instantly turned it over, so that his pursuer would step upon it when the cut side was downward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It immediately snapped under his pressure, and precipitated him into the stream, while the young rogue stood by almost killing himself with laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But this joke also came very near having a melancholy <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> termination; for the master was floated down several rods into deep water, and with difficulty saved himself from drowning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>There was a creek not far from his father's house, where it was customary to load sloops with wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Upon <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions, he persuaded a party of boys to pry up a pile of wood and tip it into a sloop, in a confused heap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Of course, it must all be taken out and reloaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>When he saw how much labor this foolish trick had caused, he felt some compunction; but the next temptation found the spirit of mischief too strong to be resisted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Coming home from his uncle's <num value="1">one</num> evening, he stopped to amuse himself with taking a gate off its hinges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>When an old <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> came out to see who was meddling with his gate, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> fired a gun over his head, and made him run into the house, as if an evil spirit were after him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It was his delight to tie the boughs of trees together in narrow paths, that people travelling in the dark, might hit their heads against them; and to lay stones in the ruts of the road, when he knew that farmers were going to market with eggs, in the darkness of morning twilight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>If any mischief was done for miles round, it was sure to be attributed to <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,,," id="n0266.0003.00008.00084" reg="default:Hopper,Isaac,,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>There was no malice in his fun; but he had such superabounding life within him, that it <hi rend="italics">would</hi> overflow, even when he knew that he must <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> suffer for it. His boyish activity, strength, and agility were proverbial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Long after he left his native village, the neighbors used to tell with what astonishing rapidity he would descend high trees, head foremost, clinging to the trunk with his feet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The fearlessness and firmness of character, which he inherited from both father and mother, manifested itself in many ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>He had a lamb, whose horns were crooked, and had a tendency to turn in. His father had given it to him for his own, on condition that he should keep the horns carefully filed, so that they should not hurt the animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>He had a small file on purpose, and took such excellent care of his pet, that it soon became very much attached to him, and trotted about after him like a dog. When he was about <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> old, <name>British</name> soldiers came into the neighborhood to seize provisions for the army, according to their custom during our revolutionary war. They tied the feet of the tame lamb, and threw it into the cart with other sheep and lambs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> came up to them in season to witness this operation, and his heart swelled with indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>He sprang into the cart, exclaiming, <q direct="unspecified">That's <hi rend="italics">my</hi> lamb, and you shan't have it!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The men tried to push him aside; but he pulled out a rusty jack-knife, which he had bought of a pedlar for <measure n="2d." type="currency"><num value="2">two</num>-pence</measure>, and cut the rope that bound the poor lamb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>A British officer rode up, and seeing a little boy struggling so <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> resolutely with the soldiers, he inquired what was the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/><q direct="unspecified">They've stolen my lamb!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>exclaimed <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>; <q direct="unspecified">and they shan't have it. It's <hi rend="italics">my</hi> lamb!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Is</hi> it your lamb, my brave little fellow?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>said the officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, they shan't have it. You'll make a fine soldier <num value="1">one</num> of these days.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/></p> 
<p>So <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> lifted his lamb from the cart, and trudged off victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>He had always been a whig; and after this adventure, he became more decided than ever in his politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>He often used to boast that he would rather have a paper continental dollar, than a golden <name>English</name> guinea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The family amused themselves by exciting his zeal, and <persName n="Polly,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00010.00085" reg="mostcommon:Polly,nomatch:0"><surname>Polly</surname></persName> made him believe he was such a famous whig, that the <rs>British</rs> would certainly carry him off to prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>He generally thought he was fully capable of defending himself; but when he saw <num value="4">four</num> soldiers approaching the house <num value="1">one</num> day, he concluded the force was rather too strong for him, and hastened to hide himself in the woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>His temper partook of the general strength and vehemence of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Having put a small quantity of gunpowder on the stove of the schoolhouse, it exploded, and did some injury to the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Going home from school, he <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> seized the informer as they were passing through a wood, tied him up to a tree, and gave him a tremendous thrashing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The boy threatened to tell of it; but he assured him that he would certainly kill him if he did; so he never ventured to disclose it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>In general, his conscience reproved him as soon as he had done anything wrong, and he hastened to make atonement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>A poor boy, who attended the same school, usually brought a very scanty dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/><num value="1">One</num> day, the spirit of mischief led <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> to spoil the poor child's provisions by filling his little pail with sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It proved a lucky joke for <persName><foreName>Billy</foreName></persName>; for from that day henceforth, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> always helped him plentifully from his own stock of provisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> and his elder brother were accustomed to set traps in the woods to catch partridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/><num value="1">One</num> day, when he was about <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> old, he went to look at the traps early in the morning and finding his empty, he took a plump partridge from his brother's trap, put it in his own and carried it home as his.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>After he went to bed, his conscience scorched him for what he had done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>As soon as he rose in the morning, he went to his mother and said, <q direct="unspecified">What shall I do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>I have told a lie, and I feel dreadfully about it. That <hi rend="italics">was</hi> <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>'s partridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/></p> 
<p>Accordingly, he went to his brother, and said, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>, here's your partridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>I did take it out of my trap; but I put it in there <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>His brother gave him a talking, and then forgave him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Being a very bright, manly boy, he was intrusted to carry grain several miles to mill, when he was only <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/><q direct="unspecified">Just let me drive in before you shut it,</q> said <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">and then I shall have no need to get down from my wagon.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The boy patiently held the gate for him to pass through; but, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, without stopping to thank him, whipped up his horse, arrived at the mill post haste, and claimed the right to be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> served, because he was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> comer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>When the other boy found he was compelled to wait, he looked very much dissatisfied, <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> but said nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> chuckled over his victory at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but his natural sense of justice soon suggested better thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>He asked himself whether he had done right thus to take advantage of that obliging boy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The longer he reflected upon it, the more uncomfortable he felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>At last, he went up to the stranger and said frankly, <q direct="unspecified">I did wrong to drive up to the mill so fast, and get my corn ground, when you were the <num value="1">one</num> who arrived <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; especially as you were so obliging as to hold the gate open for me to pass through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>I was thinking of nothing but fun when I did it. Here's sixpence to make up for it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The boy was well pleased with the amend thus honorably offered, and they parted right good friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>At <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> old, he began to drive a wagon to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, to sell vegetables and other articles from his father's farm; which he did very satisfactorily, with the assistance of a neighbor, who occupied the next stall in the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>According to the fashion of the times, he wore a broad-brimmed hat, and small-clothes with long stockings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Being something of a dandy, he prided himself upon having his shoes very clean, and his white dimity small clothes without spot or blemish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>He caught rabbits, and sold them, till he obtained money enough to purchase brass buckles for his knees, and for the straps of his shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time he made <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> his appearance in the city with this new finery, he felt his ambition concerning personal decoration completely satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The neatness of his dress, and his manly way of proceeding, attracted attention, and induced his customers to call him <q direct="unspecified">the little Governor.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>For several years, he was universally known in the market by that title.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Fortunately, his father had no wish to obtain undue advantage in the sale of his produce; for had it been otherwise, his straight-forward little son would have proved a poor agent in transacting his affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/><num value="1">One</num> day, when a citizen inquired the price of a pair of chickens, he answered, with the utmost simplicity, <q direct="unspecified">My father told me to sell them for <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> if I could; and if not, to take <num value="40">forty</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Well done, my honest little fellow!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>said the gentleman, smiling, <q direct="unspecified">I will give you whatever is the current price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>I shall look out for you in the market; and whenever I see you, I shall always try to trade with you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>And he kept his word.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>When quite a small boy, he was sent some distance of an errand, and arrived just as the family were about to sit down to supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>There were several pies on the table, and they invited him to partake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The long walk had whetted his appetite, and the pies looked exceedingly tempting; but the shyness of childhood led him to say, <q direct="unspecified">No, I thank you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>When he had delivered his message, <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> he lingered, and lingered, hoping they would ask him again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>But the family were <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>, and they understood yea to mean yea, and nay to mean nay. They would have considered it a mere worldly compliment to repeat the invitation; so they were silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> started for home, much repenting of his bashfulness, and went nearly half of the way revolving the subject in his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He then walked back to the house, marched boldly into the supper-room, and said, <q direct="unspecified">I told a lie when I was here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>I did want a piece of pie; but I thought to be sure you would ask me again.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>This explicit avowal made them all smile, and he was served with as much pie as he wished to eat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The steadfastness of his whig principles led him to take a lively interest in anecdotes concerning revolutionary heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>His mother had a brother in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, who lived in a house formerly occupied by <persName n="Penn,,William,,," id="n0266.0003.00015.00087" reg="default:Penn,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Penn</surname></persName>, at the corner of <address><street n="2 Street">Second Street</street></address> and <placeName reg="Norris Alley">Norris Alley</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>This uncle frequently cut and made garments for <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0266.0003.00015.00088" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Bushrod,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <persName n="Franklin,,Benjamin,,," id="n0266.0003.00015.00089" reg="default:Franklin,Benjamin,,,"><foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and other distinguished men. Nothing pleased <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> better than a visit to this city relative; and when there, his boyish mind was much occupied with watching for the famous men, of whom he had heard so much talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Once, when <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0266.0003.00015.00090" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Bushrod,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> came there to order some garments, he followed him a long distance from the shop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> General had observed his wonder and veneration, and was amused by it. Coming to a corner of the street, he turned round suddenly, touched his hat, and made a very low bow. This playful condescension so completely confused his juvenile admirer, that he stood blushing and bewildered for an instant, then walked hastily away, without remembering to return the salutation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The tenderness of spirit often manifested by him, was very remarkable in such a resolute and mischievous boy. There was an old unoccupied barn in the neighborhood, a favorite resort of swallows in the <rs type="place">Spring</rs>-time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>When he was about <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> old, he invited a number of boys to meet him the next <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, to go and pelt the swallows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>They set off on this expedition with anticipations of a fine frolic; but before they had gone far, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> began to feel a strong conviction that he was doing wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>He told his companions he thought it was very cruel sport to torment and kill poor little innocent birds; especially as they might destroy mothers, and then the little ones would be left to starve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>There was a Quaker meeting-house about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> distant, and he proposed that they should all go there, and leave the swallows in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>But the boys only laughed at him, and ran off shouting, <q direct="unspecified">Come on!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Come on!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>He looked after them sorrowfully for some minutes, reproaching himself for the suffering he had caused the poor birds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>He <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> then walked off to meeting alone; and his faithfulness to the light within him was followed by a sweet peacefulness and serenity of soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The impression made by this incident, and the state of mind he enjoyed while in meeting, was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest influences that drew him into the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>.&mdash; When he returned home, he heard that <num value="1">one</num> of the boys had broken his arm while stoning the swallows, and had been writhing with pain, while he had been enjoying the consolations of an approving conscience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>At an early age, he was noted for being a sure shot, with bow and arrow, or with gun. A pair of king-birds built in his father's orchard, and it was desirable to get rid of them, because they destroy honey-bees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> watched for an opportunity, and <num value="1">one</num> day when the birds flew away in quest of food for their young, he transfixed them both at once with his arrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, he was much delighted with this exploit; but his compassionate heart soon became troubled about the orphan little ones, whom he pictured to himself as anxiously expecting the parents that would never return to feed them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>This feeling gained such strength within him, that he early relinquished the practice of shooting, though he found keen excitement in the pursuit, and was not a little proud of his skill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Once, when he had entrapped a pair of partridges, he put them in a box, intending to keep them there <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> But he soon began to query with himself whether creatures accustomed to fly must not necessarily be very miserable shut up in such a limited space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>He accordingly opened the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/><num value="1">One</num> of the partridges immediately walked out, but soon returned to prison to invite his less ventursome mate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The box was removed a few days after, but the birds remained about the garden for months, often coming to the door-step to pick up crumbs that were thrown to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>When the mating-season returned the next year, they retired to the woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>From earliest childhood he evinced great fondness for animals, and watched with lively interest all the little creatures of the woods and fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>He was familiar with all their haunts, and they gave names to the localities of his neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>There was Turkey Causeway, where wild turkies abounded; and <placeName reg="Rabbit Swamp">Rabbit Swamp</placeName>, where troops of timid little rabbits had their hiding places; and <placeName reg="Squirrel Grove">Squirrel Grove</placeName>, where many squirrels laid in their harvest of acorns for the winter; and <placeName reg="Panther Bridge">Panther Bridge</placeName>, where his grandfather had killed a panther.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Once, when his father and the workmen had been cutting down a quantity of timber, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> discovered a squirrel's nest in a hole of <num value="1">one</num> of the trees that had fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It contained <num value="4">four</num> new-born little ones, their eyes not yet opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>He was greatly tempted to carry them home, but they were so young that they <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> needed their mother's milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>So after examining them, he put them back in the nest, and with his usual busy helpfulness went to assist in stripping bark from the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>When he went home from his work, toward evening, he felt curious to see how the mother squirrel would behave when she returned and found her home was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>He accordingly hid himself in a bush to watch her proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>About dusk, she came running along the stone wall with a nut in her mouth, and went with all speed to the old familiar tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Finding nothing but a stump remaining there, she dropped the nut and looked around in evident dismay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>She went smelling all about the ground, then mounted the stump to take a survey of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>She raised herself on her hind legs and snuffed the air, with an appearance of great perplexity and distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>She ran round the stump several times, occasionally raising herself on her hind legs, and peering about in every direction, to discover what had become of her young family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>At last, she jumped on the prostrate trunk of the tree, and ran along till she came to the hole where her babies were concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>What the manner of their meeting was nobody can tell; but doubtless the mother's heart beat violently when she discovered her lost treasures all safe on the warm little bed of moss she had so carefully prepared for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>After staying a few minutes to give them their supper, she came out, <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> and scampered off through the bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>In about <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>, she returned and took <num value="1">one</num> of the young ones in her mouth, and carried it quickly to a hole in another tree, <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> off, and then came back and took the others, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, till she had conveyed them all to their new home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The intelligent instinct manifested by this little quadruped excited great interest in <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s observing mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>When he drove the cows to pasture, he always went by that tree, to see how the young family were getting along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>In a short time, they were running all over the tree with their careful mother, eating acorns under the shady boughs, entirely unconscious of the perils through which they had passed in infancy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Some time after, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> traded with another boy for a squirrel taken from the nest before its eyes were open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>He made a bed of moss for it, and fed it very tenderly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, he was afraid it would not live; but it seemed healthy, though it never grew so large as other squirrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>He did not put it in a cage; for he said to himself that a creature made to frisk about in the green woods could not be happy shut up in a box. This pretty little animal became so much attached to her kind-hearted protector, that she would run about after him, and come like a kitten whenever he called her. While he was gone to school, she frequently ran off to the woods and played <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> with wild squirrels on a tree that grew near his path homeward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Sometimes she took a nap in a large knot-hole, or, if the weather was very warm, made a cool bed of leaves across a crotch of the boughs, and slept there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>When <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> passed under the tree, on his way from school, he used to call <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Bun">Bun</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/><placeName reg="Bun">Bun</placeName>! <placeName reg="Bun">Bun</placeName>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>If she was there, she would come to him immediately, run up on his shoulder, and so ride home to get her supper.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>It seemed as if animals were in some way aware of his kindly feelings, and disposed to return his confidence; for on several occasions they formed singular intimacies with him. When he was <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> old, he spied a crow's nest in a high tree, and according to his usual custom, he climbed up to make discoveries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>He found that it contained <num value="2">two</num> eggs, and he watched the crow's movements until her young ones were hatched and ready to fly. Then he took them home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/><num value="1">One</num> was accidentally killed a few days after, but he reared the other, and named it <persName n="Cupid,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00021.00091" reg="mostcommon:Cupid,nomatch:0"><surname>Cupid</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The bird became so very tame, that it would feed from his hand, perch on his shoulder, or his hat, and go everywhere with him. It frequently followed him for miles, when he went to mill or market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>He was never put into a cage, but flew in and out of the house, just as he pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>If <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> called <q direct="unspecified">Cu!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Cu!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>he would hear him even if he were up in the highest tree, would croak a friendly answer, <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> and come down directly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>If <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> winked <num value="1">one</num> eye, the crow would do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>If he winked his other eye, the crow also winked with his other eye. Once when <persName n="Cupid,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00022.00092" reg="mostcommon:Cupid,nomatch:0"><surname>Cupid</surname></persName> was on his shoulder, he pointed to a snake lying in the road, and said <q direct="unspecified">Cu!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Cu!</q>&mdash; The sagacious bird pounced on the head of the snake and killed him instantly; then flew back to his friend's shoulder, cawing with all his might, as if delighted with his exploit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>If a stranger tried to take him, he would fly away, screaming with terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Sometimes <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> covered him with a handkerchief and placed him on a stranger's shoulder; but as soon as he discovered where he was, he seemed frightened most to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>He usually chose to sleep on the roof of a shed, directly under <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s bed-room window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/><num value="1">One</num> night he heard him cawing very loud, and the next morning he said to his father, <q direct="unspecified">I heard <persName n="Cupid,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00022.00093" reg="mostcommon:Cupid,nomatch:0"><surname>Cupid</surname></persName> talking in his sleep last night.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>His father inquired whether he had seen him since; and when <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> answered, <q direct="unspecified">No,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">Then I am afraid the owls have taken him.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The poor bird did not make his appearance again; and a few days after, his bones and feathers were found on a stump, not far from the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>This was a great sorrow for <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>It tried his young heart almost like the loss of a brother.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>His intimacy with animals was of a very pleasant nature, except on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when he thrust his <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> arm into a hollow tree, in search of squirrels, and pulled out a large black snake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>He was so terrified, that he tumbled headlong from the tree, and it was difficult to tell which ran away fastest, he or the snake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>This incident inspired the bold boy with fear, which he vainly tried to overcome during the remainder of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>There was a thicket of underbrush between his father's farm and the village of <placeName reg="Woodbury, Cannon, Tennessee" key="tgn,2102167">Woodbury</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Once when he was sent of an errand to the village, he was seized with such a dread of snakes, that before entering among the bushes, he placed his basket on an old rail, knelt down and prayed earnestly that he might pass through without encountering a snake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>When he rose up and attempted to take his basket, he perceived a large black snake lying close beside the rail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>It may well be believed that he went through the thicket too fast to allow any grass to grow under his feet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>When he drove the cows to and from pasture, he often met an old colored man named <placeName key="tgn,2119233" n="1.000 1" reg="mingo, randolph, west virginia">Mingo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>His sympathizing heart was attracted toward him, because he had heard the neighbors say he was stolen from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> when he was a little boy. <num value="1">One</num> day, he asked <placeName key="tgn,2119233" n="1.000 1" reg="mingo, randolph, west virginia">Mingo</placeName> what part of the world he came from; and the poor old man told how he was playing with other children among the bushes, on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, when white men pounced upon them suddenly and dragged them off to a ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>He held fast hold <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> of the thorny bushes, which tore his hands dreadfully in the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The old man wept like a child, when he told how he was frightened and distressed at being thus hurried away from father, mother, brothers and sisters, and sold into slavery, in a distant land, where he could never see or hear from them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>This painful story made a very deep impression upon <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s mind; and, though he was then only <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> old, he made a solemn vow to himself that he would be the friend of oppressed Africans during his whole life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>He was as precocious in love, as in other matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Not far from his home, lived a prosperous and highly respectable <placeName reg="Quaker, Wayne, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119674">Quaker</placeName> family, named <persName n="Tatum,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00024.00094" reg="nearbymention:Tatum,Sarah,,,"><surname>Tatum</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>There were several sons, but only <num value="1">one</num> daughter; a handsome child, with clear, fair complexion, blue eyes, and a profusion of brown curly hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>She was <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s cousin, twice removed; for their great-grandfathers were half-brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>When he was only <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old, and she was not yet <num value="5">five</num>, he made up his mind that little <persName n="Tatum,,Sarah,,," id="n0266.0003.00024.00095" reg="default:Tatum,Sarah,,,"><foreName>Sarah</foreName> <surname>Tatum</surname></persName> was his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>He used to walk a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> every day, on purpose to escort her to school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>When they rambled through the woods, in search of berries, it was his delight to sit beside her on some old stump, and twist her glossy brown ringlets over his fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>A lovely picture they must have made in the green, leafy frame-work of the woods&mdash;that fair, blue-eyed girl, and the handsome, <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> vigorous boy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>When he was <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> old, he wrote to her his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> love-letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>The village schoolmaster taught for very low wages, and was not remarkably well-qualified for his task; as was generally the case at that early period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s labor was needed on the farm all the summer; consequently, he was able to attend school only <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> during the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>He was, therefore, so little acquainted with the forms of letter-writing, that he put <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>'s name inside the letter, and his own on the outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>She, being an only daughter, and a great pet in her family, had better opportunities for education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>She told her young lover that was not the correct way to write a letter, and instructed him how to proceed in future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>From that time, they corresponded constantly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> likewise formed a very strong friendship with his <persName n="Whitall,Cousin,Joseph,,," id="n0266.0003.00025.00096" reg="default:Whitall,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Cousin">cousin</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Whitall</surname></persName>, who was his schoolmate, and about his own age. They shared together all their joys and troubles, and were companions in all boyish enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Thus was a happy though laborious childhood passed in the seclusion of the woods, in the midst of home influences and rustic occupations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>His parents had no leisure to bestow on intellectual culture; for they had a numerous family of children, and it required about all their time to feed and clothe them respectably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>But they were worthy, kind-hearted people, whose moral precepts <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> were sustained by their upright example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>His father was a quiet man, but exceedingly firm and energetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>When he had made up his mind to do a thing, no earthly power could turn him from his purpose; especially if any question of conscience were involved therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>During the revolutionary war, he faithfully maintained his testimony against the shedding of blood, and suffered considerably for refusing to pay military taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s mother was noted for her fearless character, and blunt directness of speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>She was educated in the <rs>Presbyterian</rs> faith, and this was a source of some discordant feeling between her and her husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>The preaching of her favorite ministers seemed to him harsh and rigid, while she regarded <placeName reg="Quaker, Wayne, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119674">Quaker</placeName> exhortations as insipid and formal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>But as time passed on, her religious views assimilated more and more with his; and about <measure n="24years" type="date">twenty-four years</measure> after their marriage, she joined the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>, and frequently spoke at their meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>She was a spiritual minded woman, always ready to sympathise with the afflicted, and peculiarly kind to animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>They were both extremely hospitable and benevolent to the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> evenings, they convened all the family to listen to the <name>Scriptures</name> and other religious books.&mdash; In his journal <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> alludes to this custom, and says: <q direct="unspecified">My mind was often solemnized by these opportunities, <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> and I resolved to live more consistently with the principles of christian sobriety.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/></p> 
<p>When he was <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> old, it became a question to what business he should devote himself.&mdash; There was a prospect of obtaining a situation for him in a store at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>; and for that purpose it was deemed expedient that he should take up his abode for a while with his maternal uncle, whose house he had been so fond of visiting in early boyhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>He did not succeed in obtaining the situation he expected, but remained in the city on the look-out for some suitable employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Meanwhile, he was very helpful to his uncle, who, finding him diligent and skillful, tried to induce him to learn his trade.&mdash; It was an occupation ill-adapted to his vigorous body and active mind; but he was not of a temperament to fold his hands and wait till something <q direct="unspecified">turned up;</q> and as his uncle was doing a prosperous business, he concluded to accept his proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>About the same time, his beloved cousin, <persName n="Whitall,,Joseph,,," id="n0266.0003.00027.00097" reg="default:Whitall,Joseph,,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Whitall</surname></persName>, was sent to <placeName reg="Trenton, Gibson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101856">Trenton</placeName> to study law. This was rather a severe trial to <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Not that he envied his superior advantages; but he had sad forebodings that separation would interrupt their friendship, and that such a different career would be very likely to prevent its renewal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>They parted with mutual regret, and did not meet again for several years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>When <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> bade adieu to the paternal roof, his <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> mother looked after him thoughtfully, and remarked to <num value="1">one</num> of his sisters, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> is no common boy.&mdash; He will do something great, either for good or evil.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>She called him back and said, <q direct="unspecified">My son, you are now going forth to make your own way in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Always remember that you are as good as any other person; but remember also that you are no better.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>With this farewell injunction, he departed for <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, where he soon acquired the character of a faithful and industrious apprentice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>But his boyish love of fun was still strong within him, and he was the torment of all his fellow apprentices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, named <persName n="Roberts,,William,,," id="n0266.0003.00028.00098" reg="default:Roberts,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Roberts</surname></persName>, proposed that they should go together into the cellar to steal a pitcher of cider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> pulled the spile, and while <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> was drawing the liquor, he took an unobserved opportunity to hide it. When the pitcher was full, he pretended to look all around for it, without being able to find it. At last, he told his unsuspecting comrade that he must thrust his finger into the hole and keep it there, while he went to get another spile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/><persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> waited and waited for him to return, but when an hour or more had elapsed, his patience was exhausted, and he began to Halloo!&mdash; The noise, instead of bringing <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> to his assistance, brought the mistress of the house, who caught the culprit at the cider-barrel, and gave him a severe <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> scolding, to the infinite gratification of his mischievous companion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Once, when the family were all going away, his uncle left the house in charge of him and another apprentice, telling them to defend themselves if any robbers came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Having a mind to try the courage of the lads, he returned soon after, and attempted to force a window in the back part of the house, which opened upon a narrow alley inclosed by a high fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>As soon as <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> heard the noise, he seized an old harpoon that was about the premises, and told his companion to open the window the instant he gave the signal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>His orders were obeyed, and he flung the harpoon with such force, that it passed through his uncle's vest and coat, and nailed him tight to the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>When he told the story, he used to say he never afterward deemed it necessary to advise <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> to defend himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Among the apprentices was <num value="1">one</num> much older and stouter than the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>He was very proud of his physical strength, and delighted to play the tyrant over those who were younger and weaker than himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>When <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> saw him knocking them about, he felt an almost irresistible temptation to fight; but his uncle was a severe man, likely to be much incensed by quarrels among his apprentices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>He knew, moreover, that a battle between him and <persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00029.00099" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName> would be very unequal; so he restrained his indignation <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> as well as he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>But <num value="1">one</num> day, when the big bully knocked him down, without the slightest provocation, he exclaimed, in great wrath, <q direct="unspecified">If you ever do that again, I'll kill you. Mind what I say. I tell you I'll kill you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/></p> 
<p><persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00030.00100" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName> snapped his fingers and laughed, and the next day he knocked him down again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/><persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> armed himself with a heavy window-bar, and when the apprentices were summoned to breakfast, he laid wait behind a door, and levelled a blow at the tyrant, as he passed through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>He fell, without uttering a single cry. When the family sat down to breakfast, <persName n="Tatem,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0003.00030.00101" reg="mostcommon:Tatem,Rachel,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tatem</surname></persName> said, <q direct="unspecified">Where is <persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00030.00102" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/></p> 
<p>His nephew coolly replied, <q direct="unspecified">I've killed him.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Killed him!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>exclaimed the uncle.

<p><q direct="unspecified">I told him I would kill him if he ever knocked me down again,</q> rejoined <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>; <q direct="unspecified">and I <hi rend="italics">have</hi> killed him.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/></p> 
<p>They rushed out in the utmost consternation, and found the young man entirely senseless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>A physician was summoned, and for some time they feared he was really dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>The means employed to restore him were at last successful; but it was long before he recovered from the effects of the blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>When <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> saw him so pale and helpless, a terrible remorse filled his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>He shuddered to think how nearly he had committed murder, in <num value="1">one</num> rash moment <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> of unbridled rage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>This awful incident made such a solemn and deep impression on him, that from that time he began to make strong and earnest efforts to control the natural impetuosity of his temper; and he finally attained to a remarkable degree of selfcontrol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Weary hours of debility brought wiser thoughts to <persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00031.00103" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName> also; and when he recovered his strength, he never again misused it by abusing his companions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>In those days, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> did not profess to be a Quaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>He used the customary language of the world, and liked to display his well-proportioned figure in neat and fashionable clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>The young women of his acquaintance, it is said, looked upon him with rather favorable eyes; but his thoughts never wandered from <persName n="Tatum,,Sarah,,," id="n0266.0003.00031.00104" reg="default:Tatum,Sarah,,,"><foreName>Sarah</foreName> <surname>Tatum</surname></persName> for a single day. Once, when he had a new suit of clothes, and stylish boots, the tops turned down with red, a young man of his acquaintance invited him to go home with him on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> and spend <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>He accepted the invitation, and set out well pleased with the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>The young man had a sister, who took it into her head that the visit was intended as an especial compliment to herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>The brother was called out somewhere in the neighborhood, and as soon as she found herself alone with their guest, she began to specify, in rather significant terms, what she should require of a man who wished to marry her.&mdash; <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> Her remarks made <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> rather fidgetty; but he replied, in general terms, that he thought her ideas on the subject were very correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/><q direct="unspecified">I suppose you think my father will give me considerable money,</q> said she; <q direct="unspecified">but that is a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Whoever takes me must take me for myself alone.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/></p> 
<p>The young man tried to stammer out that he did not come on any such errand; but his wits were bewildered by this unexpected siege, and he could not frame a suitable reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>She mistook his confusion for the natural timidity of love, and went on to express the high opinion she entertained of him. <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> looked wistfully at the door, in hopes her brother would come to his rescue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>But no relief came from that quarter, and fearing he should find himself engaged to be married without his own consent, he caught up his hat and rushed out. It was raining fast, but he splashed through mud and water, without stopping to choose his steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Crossing the yard in this desperate haste, he encountered the brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>who called out, <q direct="unspecified">Where are you going?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">I'm going home,</q> he replied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/><q direct="unspecified">Going home!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>exclaimed his astonished friend, <q direct="unspecified">Why it is raining hard; and you came to stay all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>What does possess you, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Come back!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Come back, I say!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">I won't come back!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>shouted <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, from the distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/><q direct="unspecified">I'm going home.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>And home he went.&mdash; <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> His new clothes were well spattered, and his red-top boots loaded with mud; but though he prided himself on keeping his apparel in neat condition, he thought he had got off cheaply on this occasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>Soon after he went to reside in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, a sea captain by the name of <persName n="Cox,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00033.00105" reg="mostcommon:Cox,nomatch:0"><surname>Cox</surname></persName> came to his uncle's on a visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>He at once accused him of being a runaway slave, and ordered him to go to the house with him. <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName> called him his old friend, and seemed much pleased at the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>He said there was a vessel then in port, which would sail for <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName> in a few days, and told <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName> he had better go and stay with him at <placeName><persName n="Tatem,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0003.00033.00107" reg="mostcommon:Tatem,Rachel,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tatem</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, while he made inquiries about it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>When <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> entered the kitchen that evening, he found <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName> sitting there, in a very disconsolate attitude; <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> and watching him closely he observed tears now and then trickling down his dark cheeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/><persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName> gave him an earnest look of distress and scrutiny, which his young benefactor never forgot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>Again he assured him, most solemnly, that he might trust him. Then <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName> ventured to acknowledge that he was a fugitive slave, and had great dread of being returned into bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>He said his master let him out to work on board a ship going to <placeName key="tgn,7007567;tgn,7007568" n="0.164 000000.8180	placename;tgn,7007567;new york, kings, new york,Kings,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.041 000000.2045	placename;tgn,7007568;new york,United States,North and Central America" reg="new york, kings, new york,Kings,New York,United States,North and Central America;new york,United States,North and Central America">New-York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>He had a great desire for freedom, and when the vessel arrived at its destined port, he made his escape, and travelled to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, in hopes of finding some <num value="1">one</num> willing to protect him.

<p>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> had of carrying into effect his early resolution to befriend the oppressed <rs>Africans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>But though some of her admirers abounded in worldly goods, her mind never swerved from the love of her childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>The bright affectionate school-boy, who delighted to sit with her under the shady trees, and twist her shining curls over his fingers, retained his hold upon her heart as long as its pulses throbbed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Her father at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> felt some uneasiness, lest his daughter should marry out of the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>At that period, there were several remarkable individuals among <placeName reg="Quaker, Wayne, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119674">Quaker</placeName> preachers in that part of the country, and their meetings were unusually lively and spirit-stirring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, named <persName n="Nicholas,,,,," id="n0266.0003.00036.00114" reg="mostcommon:Nicholas,nomatch:0"><surname>Nicholas</surname></persName> <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> Waln, was educated in the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>, but in early life seems to have cared little about their principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>He was then an ambitious, money-loving man, remarkably successful in worldly affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>But the principles inculcated in childhood probably remained latent within him; for when he was rapidly acquiring wealth and distinction by the practice of law, he suddenly relinquished it, from conscientious motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>This change of feeling is said to have been owing to the following incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>He had charge of an important case, where a large amount of property was at stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>In the progress of the cause, he became more and more aware that right was not on the side of his client; but to desert him in the midst was incompatible with his ideas of honor as a lawyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>This produced a conflict within him, which he could not immediately settle to his own satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>A friend, who met him after the case was decided, inquired what was the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>He replied, <q direct="unspecified">I did the best I could for my client.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>I have gained the cause for him, and have thereby defrauded an honest man of his just dues.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>He seemed sad and thought-&gt; ful, and would never after plead a cause at the bar. He dismissed his students, and returned to his clients all the money he had received for unfinished cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>For some time afterward, he appeared to take no interest in anything but his own religious state of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>He eventually became a preacher, very popular <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> among Friends, and much admired by others.&mdash; His sermons were usually short, and very impressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>A cotemporary thus describes the effect of his preaching: <q direct="unspecified">The whole assembly seemed to be baptized together, and so covered with solemnity, that when the meeting broke up, no <num value="1">one</num> wished to enter into conversation with another.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>He was particularly zealous against a paid ministry, and not unfrequently quoted the text, <q direct="unspecified">Put me in the priest's office, I pray thee, that I may eat a piece of bread.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/><num value="1">One</num> of his most memorable discourses began with these words: <q direct="unspecified">The lawyers, the priests, and the doctors, these are the deceivers of men.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>He was so highly esteemed, that when he entered the court-house, as he occasionally did, to aid the poor or the oppressed in some way, it was not uncommon for judges and lawyers to rise spontaneously in token of respect.&mdash; <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> had great veneration for his character, and was much edified by his ministry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Her exhortations took deep hold of his youthful feelings, and strongly influenced him to a religious life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>But more powerful than all other agencies was the preaching of <persName n="Savery,,William,,," id="n0266.0003.00038.00116" reg="default:Savery,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Savery</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>If poverty tempted him to this false step, the owner will keep the whole transaction secret, and will gladly put him in the way of obtaining money by means more likely to bring him peace of mind.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>This singular advertisement attracted considerable attention; but the culprit alone knew whence the benevolent offer came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>When he read it, his heart melted within him, and he was filled with contrition for what he had done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>A few nights afterward, as the tanner's family were about retiring to rest, they heard a timid knock, and when the door was opened, there stood <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0266.0003.00039.00118" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> with a load of hides on his shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Without looking up, he said, <q direct="unspecified">I have brought these back, <persName n="Savery,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0003.00039.00119" reg="nearbymention:Savery,William,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Savery</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>They offered to pay a large sum for his ransom; but his savage master refused to release him on any terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>This sober, industrious man, guiltless of any crime, was hand-cuffed and had his <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> arms tied behind him with a rope, to which another rope was appended, for his master to hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>While they were fastening his fetters, he spoke a few affectionate words to his weeping wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>In the midst of his parting words, his master seized the rope, mounted his horse, snapped his whip, and set off, driving poor <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> before him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>He was soon beyond the reach of his tyrant, and might have escaped easily if a company had not immediately formed to pursue him. They chased him from the shelter of the bushes to a swamp, where he was hunted like a fox, till night with friendly darkness overshadowed him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>The master resorted to various stratagems to recapture his victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Finding that he could not gain his object by deception, he forgot to sustain the quiet character he had assumed, but gave vent to his anger in a great deal of violent and profane language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>He let himself to a worthy farmer, and soon gained the confidence and good will of all the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>He ate at the same table with them, and sat with them on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> afternoons, listening to their reading of the <name>Scriptures</name> and other religious books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>This system of equality did not diminish the modesty of his deportment, but rather tended to increase his habitual humility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>He remained there several months, during which time he never dared to visit his family, though only <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles distant</measure> from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>This was a great source of unhappiness; for he was naturally affectionate, <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> and was strongly attached to his wife and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>At length, he ventured to hire a small house in a very secluded situation, not far from the village of <placeName key="tgn,2064886" n="1.000 2" reg="haddonfield, camden, new jersey">Haddonfield</placeName>; and once more he gathered his family around him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>While at his work in the day-time, he sometimes started at the mere rustling of a leaf; and in the night time, he often woke up in agony from terrifying dreams.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>The false friend, who betrayed him to his cruel master, likewise suffered greatly from fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>He dreamed that his abused friend came with a knife in <num value="1">one</num> hand and a torch in the other, threatening to murder him and burn the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>These ideas took such hold of his imagination, that he often started up in bed and screamed aloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>But <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> was too sincerely religious to cherish a revengeful spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>His friend represented to him the unchristian character of such violent measures, and advised him not to bring remorse on his soul by the shedding of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>The poor hunted fugitive seemed to be convinced, though it was a hard lesson to learn in his circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>He had early in life manifested a religious turn of mind; and this was probably increased by his continual perils and narrow escapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>He mourned over every indication of dishonesty, profanity, or dissipation, among people of his own color; and this feeling grew upon him, until he felt as if it were a duty to devote his life to missionary labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/></p> 
<p>Of course, the master was very angry, and so was the magistrate, who had inadvertently written the recognizance just as it was dictated to him. They charged Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0028.00154.00573" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> with playing a trick upon them, and threatened to prosecute him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>The magistrate asked, <q direct="unspecified">How could you say you believed the woman had a right to her freedom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>You have brought forward no evidence whatever to prove your assertion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/></p> 
<p>He replied, <q direct="unspecified">I did not say I believed she had a <hi rend="italics">legal</hi> right to her freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>That she had a <hi rend="italics">just</hi> right to it, I did believe; for I think every human being has a just claim to freedom, unless guilty of some crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>The system of slavery is founded on the grossest and most manifest injustice.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">It is sanctioned by the law of the land,</q> answered the claimant; <q direct="unspecified">and you have no right to fly in the face of the laws.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/></p> 
<p>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0028.00155.00574" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> contented himself with saying, <q direct="unspecified">If I have broken any law, I stand ready to meet the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/></p> 
<p>The speculator spent several days in fruitless search after the fugitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>When he had relinquished all hopes of finding her, he called on <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0028.00155.00575" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName> and offered to manumit her for <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>After considerable controversy he finally agreed to take <measure n="150dollars" type="currency">one hundred and fifty dollars</measure>. The money was paid, and the deed of <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> manumission made out in due form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>At parting, the claimant said, with a very bitter smile, <q direct="unspecified">I hope I may live to see you south of the <rs>Potomac</rs> some day.</q>

<p>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0028.00156.00576" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> replied, <q direct="unspecified">Thou hadst better go home and repent of sins already committed, instead of meditating the commission of more.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/></p> 
<p>When telling this story in after years, he was wont to say, <q direct="unspecified">I am aware that some will disapprove of the part I acted in that case; because they will regard it as inconsistent with the candor which men ought always to practice toward each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>I can only say that my own conscience has never condemned me for it. I could devise no other means to save the poor victim.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/></p> 
<p>Before we decide to blame Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0028.00156.00577" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> more than he blamed himself in this matter, it would be well to imagine how we ourselves should have felt, if we had been witnesses of the painful scene, instead of reading it in cool blood, after a lapse of years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>If a handsome and modest woman stood before us with her weeping little ones, asking permission to lead a quiet and virtuous life, and a pitiless law was about to tear her from husband and children and consign her to the licentious tyrant from whom she had escaped, should we not be strongly tempted to evade such a law by any means that offered at the moment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>When he called for him, with authority to take him back to the <rs>South</rs>, the poor fellow seemed dreadfully distressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>He told the keeper that his master was very severe, and he knew that terrible sufferings awaited him if he was again placed in his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>He hesitated long before he followed the keeper to the iron gate, through which he was to pass out of prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>When he saw his oppressor standing there with fetters in his hand, ready to take him away, he stopped and pleaded in the most piteous tones for permission to find a purchaser in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>His owner took not the slightest notice of these humble entreaties, but in a peremptory manner ordered him to come out.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>All this time, the keeper had stood with his hand on the key of the iron door, very reluctant to open it. But at last he unlocked it, and told the poor terrified creature that he must go. He rushed to the door in the frenzy of desperation, gazed in his master's face for an instant, then flew back, took a sharp knife, which he had concealed about him, and drew it across his throat with such force, that he fell senseless near his master's feet, spattering his garments with blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>All those who witnessed this awful scene, supposed the man was dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/><rs type="role">Dr.</rs> Church, physician of the prison, examined the wound, and said there was scarcely a possibility that he could survive, though the wind-pipe was not entirely separated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>But even the terrible admonition of that ghastly spectacle produced no relenting feelings in the hard heart of the slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>He still demanded to have his victim delivered up to him. When the keeper declined doing it, and urged the reason that the physician said he could not be moved without imminent danger to his life, the brutal tyrant exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">Damn him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/></p> 
<p>As he had the mayor's warrant for taking him, the keeper dared not incur the responsibility of disobeying his requisitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>He convened the inspectors for consultation; and they all agreed that any attempt to remove the wounded man would render them accessory to his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>They laid the case before the mayor, who ordered that the prisoner should remain undisturbed till the physician pronounced him out of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>When the master was informed of this, he swore that nobody had any right to interfere between him and his property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>He cursed the mayor, threatened to prosecute the keeper, and was in a furious rage with every body.</p>

<p>He replied, <q direct="unspecified">It is true the man is not my debtor; but the court has greatly erred in supposing that the step I have taken was merely intended to produce unnecessary delay and expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>The <rs>Recorder</rs> will doubtless recollect that Congress has passed an act prohibiting the introduction of foreign slaves into this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>It is my belief that the case now before the court is embraced within the provisions of that act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/></p> 
<p>The counsel for the claimant said a newspaper was not legal evidence of the existence of a law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/></p> 
<p>After some discussion, the court ordered a copy of the law to be procured.; but the attorney abandoned the case, and the slave was set at liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>As soon as this decision was announced, the throng of spectators, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">colored</rs>, began to shout, <q direct="unspecified">Hurra for <persName n="Hopper,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0030.00163.00593" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>He sent for a constable, who came to his door with a carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>The lad had just come up from the cellar with an armful of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>When he entered the parlor, the constable ordered him to put it down and go with him.

<p>Though reared amid the proudest distinctions of rank, he felt no inclination to smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>He blushed and was silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>The heartless conventionalities of the world stood rebuked in the presence of affectionate simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>He conveyed her to her humble home, and bade her farewell, with a thankful consciousness that he had done no irretrievable injury to her future prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>The remembrance of her would soon be to him as the recollection of last year's butterflies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>With her, the wound was deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>In the solitude of her chamber she wept in bitterness of heart over her ruined air-castles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>And that dress, which she had stolen to make an appearance befitting his bride!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>Oh, what if she should be discovered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>And would not the heart of her poor widowed mother break, if she should ever know that her child was a thief?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>Alas, her wretched forebodings proved too true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>The silk was traced to her; she was arrested on her way to the store and dragged to prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>There she refused all nourishment, and wept incessantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>On the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="2">fourth</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time>, the keeper called upon <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0047.00232.00830" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>, and informed him that there was a young girl in prison, who appeared to be utterly friendless, <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> and determined to die by starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>The kindhearted Friend immediately went to her assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>He found her lying on the floor of her cell, with her face buried in her hands, sobbing as if her heart would break.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>He tried to comfort her, but could obtain no answer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/><q direct="unspecified">Leave us alone,</q> said he to the keeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/><q direct="unspecified">Perhaps she will speak to me, if there is no <num value="1">one</num> to hear.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>When they were alone together, he put back the hair from her temples, laid his hand kindly on her beautiful head, and said in soothing tones, <q direct="unspecified">My child, consider me as thy father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>Tell me all thou hast done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>If thou hast taken this silk, let me know all about it. I will do for thee as I would for my own daughter; and I doubt not that I can help thee out of this difficulty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/></p> 
<p>After a long time spent in affectionate entreaty, she leaned her young head on his friendly shoulder, and sobbed out, <q direct="unspecified">Oh, I wish I was dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>What will my poor mother say when she knows of my disgrace?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Perhaps we can manage that she never shall know it,</q> replied he. Alluring her by this hope, he gradually obtained from her the whole story of her acquaintance with the nobleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>He bade her be comforted, and take nourishment; for he would see that the silk was paid for, and the prosecution withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2577"/><pb id="p.234" n="234"/></p> 
<p>He went immediately to her employer, and told him the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/><q direct="unspecified">This is her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offence,</q> said he. <q direct="unspecified">The girl is young, and she is the only child of a poor widow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2580"/>I will see that thou art paid for the silk.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2581"/>The man readily agreed to withdraw the prosecution, and said he would have dealt otherwise by the girl, if he had known all the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/><q direct="unspecified">Thou shouldst have inquired into the merits of the case,</q> replied Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0047.00234.00831" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.

<p>The kind-hearted man next proceeded to the hotel, and with <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> simplicity of speech inquired for <persName n="Stuart,,Henry,,," id="n0266.0047.00234.00832" reg="default:Stuart,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>The servant soon returned and conducted him to the chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>The nobleman appeared surprised that a stranger, in the plain <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> costume, should thus intrude upon his luxurious privacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>When he heard his errand, he blushed deeply, and frankly admitted the truth of the girl's statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>His benevolent visitor took the opportunity to <q direct="unspecified">bear a testimony</q> against the selfishness and sin of profligacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>He did it in such a kind and fatherly manner, that the young man's heart was <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> touched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>He excused himself, by saying that he would not have tampered with the girl, if he had known her to be virtuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/><q direct="unspecified">I have done many wrong things,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">but thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, no betrayal of confiding innocence weighs on my conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>I have always esteemed it the basest act of which man is capable.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/>The imprisonment of the poor girl, and the forlorn situation in which she had been found, distressed him greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/></p> 
<p>When the girl was arrested, she had sufficient presence of mind to assume a false name, and by that means, her true name had been kept out of the newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>Years after these events transpired, a lady called at <placeName reg="Friend Hopper's house">Friend Hopper's house</placeName>, and asked to see him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>He replied that he did not. She fixed her tearful eyes earnestly upon him, and said, <q direct="unspecified">You once helped me when in great distress.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>But the good missionary of humanity had helped too many in distress, to be able to recollect her without more precise information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>With a tremulous voice, she bade her son go into the next room for a few minutes; then dropping on her knees, she hid her face in his lap, and sobbed out, <q direct="unspecified">I am the girl who stole <pb id="p.237" n="237"/> the silk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>Oh, where should I now be, if it had not been for you!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>They became embarrassed, and the flaws in their evidence were very obvious.

<p>He gave particular directions that they should be placed in a room by themselves, apart from the contagion of more hardened offenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>To prevent unprofitable conversation, they were constantly employed in the noisy occupation of heading nails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>From time to time, the humane inspector spoke soothing and encouraging words to them, and commended their good behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2664"/>It was his custom to take a ramble in the country with his children every <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>. All who were old enough to walk joined the troop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00244.00848" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> put it away, saying he would examine it and attend to it as soon as he had leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>The man called again a short time after, and stated that he had need of <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">six dollars</measure>, and was willing to give a receipt for the whole if that sum were advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>This proposition excited suspicion, and the administrator decided in his own mind that he would pay nothing till he had examined the papers of the deceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>Searching carefully among these, he found a receipt for the money, mentioning the identical items, date, and circumstances of the transaction; stating that a due-bill had been given and lost, and was to be restored by the creditor when found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>When the man called again for payment, <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> said to him, in a quiet way, <q direct="unspecified">Friend <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00244.00849" reg="mostcommon:Jones,Absalom,,,:1"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>, I understand thou hast become pious lately.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, he also was dipped some time ago,</q> rejoined Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00245.00852" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>; <q direct="unspecified">but his neighbors say they did n't get the crown of his head under water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>The devil crept into the unbaptized part, and has been busy within him ever since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>I think thou hadst better be dipped again.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/></p> 
<p>As he spoke, he held up the receipt for <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure>. The countenance of the professedly pious man became scarlet, and he disappeared instantly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>A Dutchman once called upon Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00245.00853" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>, and said, <q direct="unspecified">A tief have stole mine goots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>They tell me you can help me, may be.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>Upon inquiring the when and the where, Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00245.00854" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> concluded that the articles had been stolen by a man whom he happened to know the police had taken up a few hours previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>But being disposed to amuse himself, he inquired very seriously, <quote>What time of the moon was it, when thy goods were stolen?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>Having received information concerning that particular, he took a slate and began to cipher diligently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>After a while, he looked up, and pronounced in a very oracular manner, <q direct="unspecified">Thou wilt find thy goods.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Shall I find mine goots?</q>

<p><q direct="unspecified">Art thou quite sure about the age of the moon?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>inquired the pretended magician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>Being assured there was no mistake on that point, he ciphered again for a few minutes, and then answered, <q direct="unspecified">Thou wilt find the thief in the hands of the police.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/></p> 
<p>The <rs>Dutchman</rs> went away, evidently inspired with profound reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>Having found his goods and the thief, according to prediction, he returned and asked for a private interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/><q direct="unspecified">Tell me dat secret,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">and I will pay you a heap of money.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">What secret?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>inquired Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00246.00855" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/><q direct="unspecified">The plain truth is, I guessed it,</q> was the reply; <q direct="unspecified">because I had heard there was a thief at the police office, with such goods as thou described.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/></p> 
<p>Though repeatedly assured that it was done only for a joke, he went away unsatisfied: and to the day of his death, he fully believed that the facetious <rs>Quaker</rs> was a conjuror.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>When Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00246.00856" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> hired <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> houses <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> where the back yards were not separated, he found himself considerably incommoded by the disorderly habits of his next neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>The dust and dirt daily swept into the yard were allowed to accumulate there in a heap, which the wind often scattered over the neater premises adjoining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>The mistress of the house was said to be of an irritable temper, likely to take offence if asked to adopt a different system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>He accordingly resolved upon a course, which he thought might cure the evil without provoking a dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/><num value="1">One</num> day, when he saw his neighbor in her kitchen, he called his own domestic to come out into the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>Pointing to the heap of dirt, he exclaimed, loud enough to be heard in the next house, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Betsy</foreName></persName>, art thou not ashamed to sweep dust and litter into such a heap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>See how it is blowing about our neighbor's yard!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>Art thou not ashamed of thyself?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">I didn't sweep any dirt there,</q> replied the girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/><q direct="unspecified">They did it themselves.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Pshaw! Pshaw! don't tell me that,</q> rejoined he. <q direct="unspecified">Our neighbor wouldn't do such an untidy thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>I wonder she hasn't complained of thee before now. Be more careful in future; for I should be very sorry to give her any occasion to say she couldn't keep the yard clean on our account.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/></p> 
<p>The domestic read his meaning in the roguish expression of his eye, and she remained silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>The <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> lesson took effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>The heap of dirt was soon removed, and never appeared afterward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>Such a character as <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00248.00857" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was of course well known throughout the city where he lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>Every school-boy had heard something of his doings, and as he walked the street, everybody recognized him, from the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Justice">chief justice</rs> to the chimney-sweep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>His personal appearance was calculated to attract attention, independent of other circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/><persName n="Bonaparte,,Joseph,,," id="n0266.0048.00248.00858" reg="default:Bonaparte,Joseph,,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>, who then resided at <placeName key="tgn,7013444" n="1.000 18" reg="bordentown, burlington, new jersey">Bordentown</placeName>, was attracted toward him the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment he saw him, on account of a strong resemblance to his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>They often met in the steamboat going down the <rs>Delaware</rs>, and on such occasions, the ex-king frequently pointed him out as the most remarkable likeness of the emperor, that he had ever met in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> or <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>He expressed the opinion that with <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s uniform on, he might be mistaken for him, even by his own household; and if he were to appear thus in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, nothing could be easier than for him to excite a revolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>But the imperial throne, even if it had been directly offered to him, would have proved no temptation to a soul like his. In some respects, his character, as well as his person, strongly resembled <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00248.00859" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>But his powerful will was remarkably under the control of conscience, and his energy was tempered <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> by an unusual share of benevolence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>If the other elements of his character had not been balanced by these <num value="2">two</num> qualities, he also might have been a skilful diplomatist, and a successful leader of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>Fortunately for himself and others, he had a nobler ambition than that of making widows and orphans by wholesale slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>The preceding anecdotes show how warmly he sympathized with the poor, the oppressed, and the erring, without limitation of country, creed, or complexion; and how diligently he labored in their behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>But from the great amount of public service that he rendered, it must not be inferred that he neglected private duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>Perhaps no man was ever more devotedly attached to wife and children than he was. His <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>, as he was wont to call her, was endowed with qualities well calculated to retain a strong hold on the affections of a sensible and conscientious man. Her kindly disposition, and the regular, simple habits of her life, were favorable to the preservation of that beauty, which had won his boyish admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>Her wavy brown hair was softly shaded by the delicate transparent muslin of her <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> cap; her face had a tender and benign expression; and her complexion; was so clear, that an old gentleman, who belonged to the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>, and who was of course not much addicted to poetic comparisons, used to say he could never look at her without thinking of the <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> clear pink and white of a beautiful conch-shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>She was scrupulously neat, and had something of that chastened coquetry in dress, which is apt to characterize the handsome women of her orderly sect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>Her drab-colored gown, not high in the neck, was bordered by a plain narrow tucker of fine muslin, visible under her snow-white neckerchief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>A white under-sleeve came just below the elbow, where it terminated in a very narrow band, nicely stitched, and fastened with <num value="2">two</num> small silver buttons, connected by a chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>She was a very industrious woman, and remarkably systematic in her household affairs; thus she contrived to find time for everything, though burdened with the care of a large and increasing family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>The apprentices always sat at table with them, and she maintained a perfect equality between them and her own children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>She said it was her wish to treat them precisely as she would like to have <hi rend="italics">her</hi> boys treated, if <hi rend="italics">they</hi> should become apprentices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> evenings, which they called <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Day evenings, the whole family assembled to hear Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00250.00860" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> read portions of scripture, or writings of the early Friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>On such occasions, the mother often gave religious exhortations to the children and apprentices, suited to the occurrences of the week, and the temptations to which they were peculiarly subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>During the last <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> of her life, she was a recommended minister of the <name>Society</name> of <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> Friends, and often preached at their meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>Her manners were affable, and her conversation peculiarly agreeable to young people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>But she knew when silence was seemly, and always restrained her discourse within the limits of discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>When any of her children talked more than was useful, she was accustomed to administer this concise caution: <q direct="unspecified">My dear, it is a nice thing to say nothing, when thou hast nothing to say.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>Her husband was proud of her, and always manifested great deference for her opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>She suffered much anxiety on account of the perils to which he was often exposed in his contests with slaveholders and kidnappers; and for many years, the thought was familiar to her mind that she might <num value="1">one</num> day see him brought home a corpse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>While the yellow fever raged in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, she had the same anxiety concerning his fearless devotion to the victims of that terrible disease, who were dying by hundreds around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>But she had a large and sympathizing heart, and she never sought to dissuade him from what he considered the path of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>When <num value="1">one</num> of his brothers was stricken with the fever, and the family with whom he resided were afraid to shelter him, she proposed to have him brought under their own roof, where he was carefully nursed till he died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>She was more reluctant to listen to his urgent entreaties that she would retire into the country with the children, and <pb id="p.252" n="252"/> remain with them beyond the reach of contagion; for her heart was divided between the husband of her youth and the nurslings of her bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>But his anxiety concerning their children was so great, that she finally consented to pursue the course most conducive to his peace of mind; and he was left in the city with a colored domestic to superintend his household affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>Through this terrible ordeal of pestilence he passed unscathed, though his ever ready sympathy brought him into frequent contact with the dying and the dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>Besides this public calamity, which darkened the whole city for a time, Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00252.00861" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> shared the common lot of humanity in the sad experiences of private life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>Several of his children died at that attractive age, when the bud of infancy is blooming into childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>Relatives and friends crossed the dark river to the unknown shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>On <dateStruct value="1797-01-01"><occasion>New Year's day</occasion>, <year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct>, his mother departed from this world at <measure n="56years" type="date">fifty-six years</measure> old. In <dateStruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>, his father died at <measure n="75years" type="date">seventy-five years</measure> of age. His physical vigor was remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>When he had weathered <num value="70">seventy</num> winters, he went to visit his eldest son, and being disappointed in meeting the stage to return, as he expected, he walked home, a distance of <measure n="28miles" type="distance">twenty-eight miles</measure>. At that advanced age, he could rest <num value="1">one</num> hand on his cane and the other on a fence, and leap over as easily as a boy. He had long flowing black hair, which <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> fell in ringlets on his shoulders; and when he died, it was merely sprinkled with gray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>When his private accounts were examined after his decease, they revealed the fact that he had secretly expended hundreds of dollars in paying the debts of poor people, or redeeming their furniture when it was attached.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>But though many dear ones dropped away from his side, as Friend <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> moved onward in his pilgrimage, many remained to sustain and cheer him. Among his wife's brothers, his especial friend was <persName n="Tatum,,John,,," id="n0266.0048.00253.00862" reg="default:Tatum,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Tatum</surname></persName>, who lived in the vicinity of his native village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>This worthy man had great sympathy with the colored people, and often sheltered the fugitives whom his brother-in-law had rescued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>He was remarkable for his love of peace; always preferring to suffer wrong rather than dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>The influence of this pacific disposition upon others was strikingly illustrated in the case of <num value="2">two</num> of his neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>They were respectable people, in easy circumstances, and the families found much pleasure in frequent intercourse with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>But after a few years, <num value="1">one</num> of the men deemed that an intentional affront had been offered him by the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>Instead of goodna-tured frankness on the occasion, he behaved in a sullen manner, which provoked the other, and the result was that eventually neither of them would speak when they met. Their fields joined, and when they were on friendly terms, the boundary was marked <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> by a fence, which they alternately repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>But when there was feud between them, neither of them was willing to mend the other's fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>So each <num value="1">one</num> built a fence for himself, leaving a very narrow strip of land between, which in process of time came to be generally known by the name of <placeName reg="Devils Lane, San Juan, Utah" key="tgn,2285755">Devil's Lane</placeName>, it allusion to the bad temper that produced it. A brook formed another portion of the boundary between their farms, and was useful to both of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>But after they became enemies, if a freshet occurred, each watched an opportunity to turn the water on the other's land, by which much damage was mutually done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>They were so much occupied with injuring each other in every possible way, that they neglected their farms and grew poorer and poorer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/><num value="1">One</num> of them became intemperate; and everything about their premises began to wear an aspect of desolation and decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>At last, <num value="1">one</num> of the farms was sold to pay a mortgage, and <persName n="Tatum,,John,,," id="n0266.0048.00254.00863" reg="default:Tatum,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Tatum</surname></persName>, who was then about to be married, concluded to purchase it. Many people warned him of the trouble he would have with a quarrelsome and intemperate neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>But, after mature reflection, he concluded to trust to the influence of a peaceful and kind example, and accordingly purchased the farm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>Soon after he removed thither, he proposed to do away the <rs type="place">Devil's Lane</rs> by building a new fence on the boundary, entirely at his own expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>His <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> neighbor acceded to the proposition in a very surly manner, and for a considerable time seemed determined to find, or make some occasion for quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>But the young <rs>Quaker</rs> met all his provocations with forbearance, and never missed an opportunity to oblige him. Good finally overcame evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>The turbulent spirit, having nothing to excite it, gradually subsided into calmness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>In process of time, he evinced a disposition to be kind and obliging also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>Habits of temperance and industry returned, and during the last years of his life he was considered a remarkably good neighbor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00255.00864" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>'s attachment to the religious society he had joined in early life was quite as strong, perhaps even stronger, than his love of kindred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>The Yearly Meeting of Friends at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> was a season of great satisfaction, and he delighted to have his house full of guests, even to overflowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>On these occasions, he obeyed the impulses of his generous nature by seeking out the least wealthy and distinguished, who would be less likely than others to receive many invitations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>In addition to these, who were often personal strangers to him, he had his own familiar and cherished friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>A day seldom passed without a visit from <persName n="Waln,,Nicholas,,," id="n0266.0048.00255.00865" reg="default:Waln,Nicholas,,,"><foreName>Nicholas</foreName> <surname>Waln</surname></persName>, who had great respect and affection for him and his wife, and delighted in their society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>He cordially approved of their consistency in carrying out their conscientious <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> convictions into the practices of daily life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>Some of <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>'s relatives and friends thought he de-. voted rather too much time and attention to philanthropic missions, but <persName n="Waln,,Nicholas,,," id="n0266.0048.00256.00866" reg="default:Waln,Nicholas,,,"><foreName>Nicholas</foreName> <surname>Waln</surname></persName> always stood by him, a warm and faithful friend to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>He was a true gentleman, of courtly, pleasing manners, and amusing conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>Notwithstanding his weight of character, he was so playful with the children, that his visits were always hailed by them, as delightful opportunities for fun and frolic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>He looked beneath the surface of society, and had learned to estimate men and things according to their real value, not by a conventional standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>His wife did not regard the pomps and vanities of the world with precisely the same degree of indifference that he did. She thought it would be suitable to their wealth and station to have a footman behind her carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>This wish being frequently expressed, her husband at last promised to comply with it. Accordingly, the next time the carriage was ordered, for the purpose of making a stylish call, she was gratified to see a footman mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>He said he himself had once received a lesson on this subject, which did him much good.

<p>He often used to inculcate the same moral by relating another incident, which happened in old times, when <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName> were accustomed to wear cocked hats turned up at the sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>A Friend bought a hat of <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> this description, without observing that it was looped up with a button.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>As he sat in meeting with his hat on, as usual, he observed many eyes directed toward him, and some with a very sorrowful expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>When consciousness began to return, he felt grieved that he was obliged to come back to this state of being, and he was never after able to feel the same interest in terrestrial things, that he had felt before he obtained this glimpse of the spiritual world.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>As he approached the village, he met a funeral procession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>He had no knowledge whatever of the deceased; but it was suddenly revealed to him that the occupant of the coffin before him was a woman whose life had been saddened by the suspicion of a crime, which she never committed.

<p>The woman in question had gone out in the fields <num value="1">one</num> day, with her infant in her arms, and she returned without it. She said she had laid it down on a heap of dry leaves, while she went to pick a few flowers; and when she returned, the baby was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>The fields and woods were searched in vain, and neighbors began to whisper that she had committed infanticide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>Then rumors arose that she was dissatisfied with her marriage; that her heart remained <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> with a young man to whom she was previously engaged; and that her brain was affected by this secret unhappiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>She was never publicly accused; partly because there was no evidence against her, and partly because it was supposed that if she did commit the crime, it must have been owing to aberation of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>But she became aware of the whisperings against her, and the consciousness of being an object of suspicion, combined with the mysterious disappearance of her child, cast a heavy cloud over her life, and made her appear more and more unlike her former self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>This she confided to her clergyman, in the interview shortly preceding her death; and she likewise told him that the young man, to whom she had been engaged, had never forgiven her for not marrying him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>He was much surprised, and asked why she thought so. She could give no explanation of it, except that it had been suddenly revealed to her mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>I have heard and read many such stories of <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>, which seem too well authenticated to admit of doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>They themselves refer all such cases to <q direct="unspecified">the inward light;</q> and that phrase, as they understand it, conveys a satisfactory explanation to their minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>These strong impressions on individual minds constitute their only call and consecration to the ministry, and have directed them in the application of moral principles to a variety of subjects, such as intemperance, war, and slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>Men and women were impelled by the interior monitor to go about preaching on these topics, until their individual views became what are called <q direct="unspecified">leading testimonies</q> in the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>In the course of their visits, they concluded to pass by <num value="1">one</num> of their members, who held only <num value="1">one</num> slave, and he was very old.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>He accordingly went alone to the master, and stated how the subject appeared to him, in the inward light of his own soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>The Friend was not easily convinced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>He brought forward many reasons for not emancipating his slave; and <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest was that the man was too feeble to labor for his own support, and therefore freedom would be of no value to him. <persName n="Jackson,,Isaac,,," id="n0266.0048.00264.00879" reg="default:Jackson,Isaac,,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> replied, <q direct="unspecified">He labored for thee without wages, while he had strength, and it is thy duty to support him now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/><pb id="p.265" n="265"/></p> 
<p>These friendly remonstrances produced such effect, that the master agreed to manumit his bondman, and give a written obligation that he should be comfortably supported during the remainder of his life, by him or his heirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>When the papers were prepared the slave was called into the parlor, and <persName n="Jackson,,Isaac,,," id="n0266.0048.00265.00880" reg="default:Jackson,Isaac,,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> inquired, <q direct="unspecified">Would'st thou like to be free?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>He promptly answered that he should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>The Friend suggested that he was now too feeble to labor much, and inquired how he would manage to obtain a living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>The old man meekly replied, <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has been kind to me thus far; and I am willing to trust him the rest of my life.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/></p> 
<p>This was so unexpected, that the aged bondman was completely overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>For a few moments, he remained in profound silence; then, with a sudden impulse, he fell on his knees, and poured forth a short and fervent prayer of thanksgiving to his <name n="God" type="God">Heavenly Father</name>, for prolonging his life till he had the happiness to feel himself a free man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>The master and his adviser were both surprised and affected by this eloquent outburst of grateful feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>The poor old servant had seemed so comfortable and contented, that no <num value="1">one</num> supposed freedom <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> was of great importance to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>When he had been in that city some time; he mentioned that his wife owned land in <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>, which he was very desirous to cultivate, but was prevented by conscientious scruples concerning slave-labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>He said if he could induce some colored people from <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> to go there and work for him as free laborers, it would be an advantage to him, and a benefit to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>He urged Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00266.00885" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> <pb id="p.267" n="267"/> to exert his influence over them to convince them that such precautions could be taken, as would prevent any danger of their being reduced to slavery; saying that if he would consent to do so, he doubtless could obtain as many laborers as he wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>The plan appeared feasible, and Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00267.00886" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was inclined to assist him in carrying it into execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>Nothing had occurred to change his opinion of the man, or to excite distrust concerning his agricultural scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>But an impression came upon his mind that the laborers had better not go; an impression so strong, that he thought it right to be influenced by it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>This greatly surprised the man who wished to employ them, and he called to expostulate on the subject; repeating his statement concerning the great advantage they would derive from entering into his service.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>This last letter stated that the writer had no thoughts of stealing the horse <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> before he did it.

But when he was arrested, and so unexpectedly set at liberty, tile crushing weight was taken from him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>He made strenuous efforts to improve his condition, and succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>He was then teaching school, was assessor of the township where he resided, and no <num value="1">one</num> suspected that he had ever committed a dishonest action.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>No sect has ever arisen which so nearly approached the character of primitive christianity, in all relations with each other and with their fellow men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>Having become established and respected by the world, the humble and selfde-nying spirit which at the outset renounced and contended with the world gradually departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>Many of them were rich, and not unfrequently their fortunes were acquired by trading with slave-holders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/><pb id="p.274" n="274"/> Such men were well satisfied to have the testimonies of their spiritual forefathers against slavery read over among themselves, at stated seasons; but they felt little sympathy with those of their cotemporaries, who considered it a duty to remonstrate publicly and freely with all who were connected with the iniquitous system.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>A strong and earnest preacher, by the name of <persName n="Hicks,,Elias,,," id="n0266.0048.00274.00901" reg="default:Hicks,Elias,,,"><foreName>Elias</foreName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName>, made himself more offensive than others in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>He appears to have been a very just and conscientious man, with great reverence for <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and exceedingly little for human authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>Everywhere, in public and in private, he lifted up his voice against the sin of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>He would eat no sugar that was made by slaves, and wear no garment which he supposed to have been produced by unpaid labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>In a remarkable manner, he showed this <q direct="unspecified">ruling passion strong in death.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>A few hours before he departed from this world, his friends, seeing him shiver, placed a comfortable over him. He felt of it with his feeble hands, and made a strong effort to push it away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>When they again drew it up over his shoulders, he manifested the same symptoms of abhorrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, who began to conjecture the cause, inquired, <q direct="unspecified">Dost thou dislike it because it is made of cotton?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>He was too far gone to speak, but he moved his head in token of assent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>When they removed the article of slave produce, <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> and substituted a woolen blanket, he remained quiet, and passed away in peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>He was accustomed to say, <q direct="unspecified">It takes <hi rend="italics">live</hi> fish to swim up stream;</q> and unquestionably he and his friend <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00275.00902" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName> were both very much alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>The quiet boldness of this man was altogether unmanageable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>In <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> or <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>, he preached more earnestly and directly against slavery, than he did in <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName> or <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, for the simple reason that it seemed to be more needed there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>Upon <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions, a slaveholder who went to hear him from curiosity, left the meeting in great wrath, swearing he would blow out that fellow's brains if he ventured near his plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>When the preacher heard of this threat, he put on his hat and proceeded straightway to the forbidden place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>In answer to his inquiries, a slave informed him that his master was then at dinner, but would see him in a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>He seated himself and waited patiently until the planter entered the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>With a calm and dignified manner, he thus addressed him: <q direct="unspecified">I understand thou hast threatened to blow out the brains of <persName n="Hicks,,Elias,,," id="n0266.0048.00275.00903" reg="default:Hicks,Elias,,,"><foreName>Elias</foreName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName>, if he comes upon thy plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/></p> 
<p>The Virginian acknowledged that he did make such a threat, and said he considered it perfectly justifiable to do such a deed, when a man came to preach rebellion to his slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/><pb id="p.276" n="276"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">I came to preach the <name>Gospel</name>, which inculcates forgiveness of injuries upon slaves as well as upon other men,</q> replied the <rs>Quaker</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/></p> 
<p>This led to a long argument, maintained in the most friendly spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>At parting, the slaveholder shook hands with the preacher, and invited him to come again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>His visits were renewed, and <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> after, the <rs>Virginian</rs> emancipated all his slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>When preaching in the free states, he earnestly called upon all to abstain from slave-produce, and thus in a measure wash their own hands from participation in a system of abominable wickedness and cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>His zeal on this subject annoyed some of his brethren, but they could not make him amena ble to discipline for it; for these views were in accordance with the earliest and strongest testimonies of the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>; moreover, it would have been discreditable to acknowledge <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a ground of offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>But the secret dissatisfaction showed itself in a disposition to find fault with him. Charges were brought against his doctrines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>He was accused of denying the authority of Scripture, and the divinity of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00276.00905" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>It was a departure from the original basis of the <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> Society to assume any standard whatsoever concerning creeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>It is true that the early <rs>Quakers</rs> wrote volumes of controversy against many of the prevailing opinions of their day; such as the doctrine of predestination, and of salvation depending upon faith, rather than upon works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>All the customary external observances, such as holy days, baptism, and the <rs>Lord</rs>'s Supper, they considered as belonging to a less spiritual age, and that the time had come for them to be done away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>Concerning the <rs>Trinity</rs>, there appears to have been difference of opinion among them from the earliest time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>But though various popular doctrines naturally came in their way, and challenged discussion, while they were endeavoring to introduce a new order of things, the characteristic feature of their movement was attention to practical righteousness rather than theological tenets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>They did not require their members to profess faith in any <pb id="p.278" n="278"/> creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>They had but <num value="1">one</num> single bond of union; and that was the belief that every man ought to be guided in his actions, and in the interpretation of Scripture, by the light within his own soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>Their history shows that they mainly used this light to guide them in the application of moral principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>Upon the priesthood, in every form, they made unsparing warfare; believing that the gifts of the <name>Spirit</name> ought never to be paid with money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>They appointed committees to visit the sick, the afflicted, and the destitute, and to superintend marriages and funerals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>The farmer, the shoemaker, the physician, or the merchant, followed his vocation diligently, and whenever the <name>Spirit</name> moved him to exhort his brethren, he did so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>Women were placed on an equality with men, by being admitted to this free Gospel ministry, and appointed on committees with men, to regulate the affairs of the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>They abjured war under all circumstances, and suffered great persecution rather than pay military taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>They early discouraged the distillation or use of spirituous liquors, and disowned any of their members who distilled them from grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>Protests against slavery were among their most earnest testimonies, and it was early made a rule of discipline that no member of the <name>Society</name> <pb id="p.279" n="279"/> should hold slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>When the <name>Quakers</name> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arose, it was a custom in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, as it still is on the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, to say <hi rend="italics">thou</hi> to an inferior, or equal, and <hi rend="italics">you</hi> to a superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>To the conservatives of their day, this spiritual democracy seemed like deliberate contempt of authority; and as such, deserving of severe punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/>More strenuously than all other things, they denied the right of any set of men to prescribe a creed for others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>The only authority they recognized was <q direct="unspecified">the light within;</q> and for freedom to follow this, they were always ready to suffer or to die.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>On all these subjects, there could be no doubt that <persName n="Hicks,,Elias,,," id="n0266.0048.00279.00912" reg="default:Hicks,Elias,,,"><foreName>Elias</foreName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName> was a Quaker of the old genuine stamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>He attached less importance to miracles, than did many of his brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>He said he had learned more of his own soul, and had clearer revelations of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and duty, while following his plough, than from all the books he had ever read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>He reverenced the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> as a <pb id="p.280" n="280"/> record of divine power and goodness, but did not consider a knowledge of it essential to salvation; for he supposed that a Hindoo or an African, who never heard of the <name>Scriptures</name>, or of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00280.00914" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, might become truly a child of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, if he humbly and sincerely followed the divine light within, given to every human soul, according to the measure of its faithfulness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>Many of his brethren, whose views assimilated more with orthodox opinions, accused him of having departed from the principles of early Friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>But his predecessors had been guided only by the light within; and he followed the same guide, without deciding beforehand precisely how far it might lead him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>The probability seems to be that the influence of <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00281.00917" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> sects, and of Orthodox sects had, in the course of years, gradually glided in among the <name>Quakers</name>, and more or less fashioned their theological opinions, though themselves were unconscious of it; as we all are of the surrounding air we are constantly inhaling.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>But it was not the <name>Unitarianism</name> of <persName n="Hicks,,Elias,,," id="n0266.0048.00281.00918" reg="default:Hicks,Elias,,,"><foreName>Elias</foreName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName> that his adherents fought for, or considered it necessary to adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>They simply contended for his right to express his own convictions, and denied the authority of any man, or body of men, to judge his preaching by the assumed standard of any creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>Therefore, the real ground of the struggle seems to have been resistance to ecclesiastical power; though theological opinions unavoidably became intertwisted with it. It was a new form of the old battle, perpetually renewed ever since the world began, between authority and individual freedom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>The agitation, which had for some time been heaving under the surface, is said to have been brought into open manifestation by a sermon which <persName n="Hicks,,Elias,,," id="n0266.0048.00281.00919" reg="default:Hicks,Elias,,,"><foreName>Elias</foreName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName> preached against the use of slave produce, in <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>A bitter warfare followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>Those <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> who refused to denounce his opinions were accused of being infidels and separatists; and they called their accusers bigoted and intolerant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3041"/>With regard to disputed doctrines, both claimed to find sufficient authority in the writings of early Friends; and each side charged the other with mutilating and misrepresenting those writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>As usual in theological controversies, the skein became more and more entangled, till there was no way left but to cut it in <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>Thenceforth, the members were divided into <num value="2">two</num> distinct sects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>In others, his opponents had a majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>Each party claimed to be the genuine <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>, and denied the other's right to retain the title.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>The latter repudiated the title, because they did not acknowledge him as their standard of belief, though they loved and reverenced his character, and stood by him as the representative of liberty of conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/>They called themselves <q direct="unspecified">Friends,</q> and the others <q direct="unspecified">the <name>Orthodox</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/></p> 
<p>The question which was the genuine <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName> was more important than it would seem to a mere looker on; for large pecuniary interests were <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> involved therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/>It is well known that <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName> form a sort of commonwealth by themselves, within the civil commonwealth by which they are governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>They pay the public school-tax, and in addition build their own school-houses, and employ teachers of their own Society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>They support their own poor, while they pay the same pauper tax as other citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>They have burying grounds apart from others, because they have conscientious scruples concerning monuments and epitaphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>Of course, the question which of the <num value="2">two</num> contending parties was the true <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName> involved the question who owned the meeting-houses, the burying grounds, and the school funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>Lawsuits were brought in various parts of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>What a bitter state of animosity existed may be conjectured from the fact that the <q direct="unspecified">Orthodox</q> in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> refused to allow <q direct="unspecified">Hicksites</q> to bury their dead in the ground belonging to the undivided <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>On the occasion of funerals, they refused to deliver up the key; and after their opponents had remonstrated in vain, they forced the lock.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>I believe in almost every instance, where the <q direct="unspecified">Hicksites</q> were a majority, and thus had a claim to the larger share of property, they offered to divide <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> in proportion to the relative numbers of the <num value="2">two</num> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/>After the separation in <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>, they renewed this offer, which had once been rejected; and the <q direct="unspecified">Orthodox</q> finally agreed to accept a stipulated sum for their interest in the property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>Some, who were styled <q direct="unspecified">The Evangelical Party,</q> went much beyond their brethren in conformity with the prevailing denominations of Christians called Orthodox.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>Many of them considered a knowledge of the letter of Scripture essential to salvation; and some even approved of baptism by water; a singular departure from the total abrogation of external rites, which characterized Quakerism from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/></p> 
<p>As the adherents of <persName n="Hicks,,Elias,,," id="n0266.0048.00285.00927" reg="default:Hicks,Elias,,,"><foreName>Elias</foreName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName> at that time represented freedom of conscience, of course <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00285.00928" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName> belonged to that party, and advocated it with characteristic zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/>In fact, he seems to have been the <rs>Napoleon</rs> of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/>It was not in his nature intentionally to misrepresent any man; and even when the controversy was raging most furiously, I believe there never was a time when he would not willingly have acknowledged a mistake the moment he perceived it. But his temperament was such, that wherever he deemed a principle of truth, justice, or freedom was at stake, he could never quit an adversary till he had demolished him completely, and <hi rend="italics">convinced</hi> him that he was demolished; though he often felt great personal kindness toward the individual thus prostrated, and was always willing to render him any friendly service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>He used to say that his resistance in this controversy was principally <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> roused by the disposition which he saw manifested <q direct="unspecified">to crush worthy, innocent Friends, for mere difference of opinion;</q> and no <num value="1">one</num>, who knew him well, could doubt that on this subject, as on others, he was impelled by a sincere love of truth and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>But neither he nor any other person ever entered the lists of theological controversy without paying dearly for the encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>Perpetual strife grieved and disturbed his own spirit, while his energy, perseverance, and bluntness of speech, gained him many enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>Wherever this unfortunate sectarian schism was introduced, it divided families, and burst asunder the bonds of friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/>For a long time, they seemed to be a Society of Enemies, instead of a <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>In this respect, no <num value="1">one</num> suffered more acutely than <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00286.00929" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>It was his nature to form very strong friendships; and at this painful juncture, many whom he had long loved and trusted, parted from him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>They had no personal altercation, but their intimacy gradually cooled off, and they became as strangers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>He had encountered other difficulties also, at a former period of his life, the shadows of which still lay across his path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>About <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> after his marriage, his health began to fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>His <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> vigorous frame pined away to a mere shadow, and he was supposed to be in a consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>At the same time, he found himself involved in pecuniary difficulties, the burden of which weighed very heavily upon him, for many reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>His strong sense of justice made it painful for him to owe debts he could not pay. He had an exceeding love of imparting to others, and these pecuniary impediments tied down his large soul with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> lilliputian cords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>He had an honest pride of independence; which chafed under any obligation that could be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>His strong attachment to the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName> rendered him sensitive to their opinion; and at that period their rules were exceedingly strict concerning any of their members, who contracted debts they were unable to pay. People are always ready to censure a man who is unprosperous in worldly affairs; and if his character is such as to render him prominent, he is all the more likely to be handled harshly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>Of these trials Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00287.00931" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> had a large share, and they disturbed him exceedingly; but the consciousness of upright intentions kept him from sinking under the weight that pressed upon him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>He was always a very industrious man, and whatever he did was well done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>But the fact was, the claims upon his time and attention were too numerous to be met by any <num value="1">one</num> mortal man. He had a large family to support, and during many years his <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> house was a home for poor <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>, and others, from far and near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>He had much business to transact in the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>, of which he was then an influential and highly respected member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> of the founders and secretary of a society for the employment of the poor; overseer of the <rs type="place">Benezet school</rs> for colored children; teacher, without recompense, in a <orgName n="Free School" type="school">free school</orgName> for colored adults; inspector of the prison, without a salary; member of a fire-company; guardian of abused apprentices; the lawyer and protector of slaves and colored people, upon all occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>When pestilence was raging, he was devoted to the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>The poor were continually calling upon him to plead with importunate landlords and creditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>He was not unfrequently employed to settle estates involved in difficulties, which others were afraid to undertake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>He had occasional applications to exert influence over the insane, for which he had peculiar tact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>When he heard of a man beginning to form habits likely to prove injurious to himself or his family, he would go to him, whether his rank were high or low, and have private conversations with him. He would tell him some story, or suppose some case, and finally make him feel, <q direct="unspecified">Thou art the man.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>He had a great gift in that way, and the exertion of it sometimes seasonably recalled those who were sliding into dangerous paths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/><pb id="p.289" n="289"/></p> 
<p>When <num value="1">one</num> reflects upon the time that must have been bestowed on all these avocations, do his pecuniary embarrassments require any further explanation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>A member of his own Society summed up the case very justly in few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>Hearing him censured by certain individuals, she replied, <q direct="unspecified">The whole amount of it is this:&mdash;the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> requires us to love our neighbor as well as ourselves; and Friend <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> has loved them better.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/></p> 
<p>These straitened circumstances continued during the remainder of his residence in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>; and his family stood by him nobly through the trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>Household expenses were reduced within the smallest possible limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>His wife opened a tea-store, as an available means of increasing their income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>The simple dignity of her manners, and her pleasing way of talking, attracted many ladies, even among the fashionable, who liked to chat with the handsome <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> matron, while they were purchasing household stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>The elder daughters taught school, and took upon themselves double duty in the charge of a large family of younger children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>How much they loved and honored their father, was indicated by their zealous efforts to assist and sustain him. I have heard him tell, with much emotion, how <num value="1">one</num> of them slipped some of her earnings into his pocket, while he slept in his arm-chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>She was anxious to save him from the pain of being unable to meet necessary <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> expenses, and at the same time to keep him ignorant of the source whence relief came.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>His spirit of independence never bent under the pressure of misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>He was willing to deprive himself of everything, except the simplest necessaries of life; but he struggled manfully against incurring obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>There was a Quaker fund for the gratuitous education of children; but when he was urged to avail himself of it, he declined, because he thought such funds ought to be reserved for those whose necessities were greater than his own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>The government added its exactions to other pecuniary annoyances; but it had no power to warp the inflexibility of his principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>He had always refused to pay the militia tax, because, in common with all conscientious <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>, he considered it wrong to do anything for the support of war. It seems no more than just that a sect, who pay a double school-tax, and a double pauper-tax, and who almost never occasion the state any expense by their crimes, should be excused for believing themselves bound to obey the injunction of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, to return good for evil; but politicians have decided that practical Christianity is not always consistent with the duty of citizens: Accordingly, when Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00290.00932" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> refused to pay for guns and swords, to shoot and stab his fellow men, they seized his goods to pay the tax. The articles chosen were often of much greater value <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> than their demand, and were sacrificed by a hurried and careless sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>His wife had received a handsome outfit from her father, at the time of her marriage; but she was destined to see <num value="1">one</num> article of furniture after another seized to pay the military fines, which were alike abhorrent to her heart and her conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>Among these articles, was a <rs n="looking glass" type="product">looking glass</rs>, of an unusually large and clear plate, which was valuable as property, and dear to her as a bridal gift from her parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>She could not see it carried off by the officer, to meet the expenses of military reviews, without a sigh-perhaps a tear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>But she was not a woman ever to imply a wish to have her husband compromise his principles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>Thus bearing up bravely against the pelting storms of life, he went on, hand in hand with his beloved <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>But at last, he was called to part with the steady friend and pleasant companion of his brightest and his darkest hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>Toward the close of her life, the freshness of her complexion was injured by continual suffering; but though pale, she remained a handsome <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> woman to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>During her long illness, she received innumerable marks of respect and affection from friends and neighbors; for she was beloved by all who knew her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>While her bereaved husband was still under the shadow of this great grief, he was called to part with his son <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, who in little more than a year, followed his mother, at the early age of <num value="15">fifteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>He was a sedate gentle lad, and had always been a very pleasant child to his parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>His father cherished <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> his memory with great tenderness, and seldom spoke of him without expressing his conviction that if he had lived he would have become a highly acceptable minister in the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>; a destiny which would have been more agreeable to his parental feelings, than having a son <rs type="role2">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>About this period northern hostility to slavery took a new form, more bold and uncompromising than the old Abolition Societies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>He told him that a meeting had been established there many years ago, but he supposed there were not <pb id="p.320" n="320"/> half a dozen members remaining, and probably they had no ministry; for the original settlers had died, or left <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> on account of their testimony against slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>But as <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName> believe that silent worship is often more blessed to the soul, than the most eloquent preaching, he had a strong desire that his son should attend the meeting constantly, even if he found but <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> to unite with him. The young man promised that he would do so. Accordingly, when he arrived in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, he inquired for the meeting-house, and was informed that it was well nigh deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3434"/>On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time> of the week, he went to the place designated, and found a venerable, kind-looking Friend seated under the preachers' gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3486"/>The evidence was satisfactory that he belonged to no anti-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">slavery society</orgName>, and that his business in <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> had no connection whatever with that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3487"/>As for the pamphlet about <placeName key="tgn,1000191" n="1.000 1" reg="sierra leone,africa">Sierra Leone</placeName>, the mayor said he considered that evidence in his favor; because it was written in support of colonization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3488"/>Before the examination closed, there came a driving rain, which dispersed the mob lying in wait round the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3489"/>Aided by this lucky storm their destined victim passed out <pb id="p.326" n="326"/> without being observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3490"/>At parting, the mayor said to him, <q direct="unspecified">Young man, you may consider it a miracle that you have escaped with your life.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3491"/></p> 
<p>He took refuge on board the <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Angelique</rs>, bound for <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>, and was received with much kindness and sympathy by <persName n="Nichols,Captain,,,," id="n0266.0048.00326.01010" reg="mostcommon:Nichols,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Nichols</surname></persName>, the commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3492"/>There was likewise a sailor on board, who happened to be <num value="1">one</num> of the many that owed a debt of gratitude to Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00326.01011" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>; and he swore he would shoot anybody that attempted to harm his son. In a short time, a messenger came from the mayor to announce that the populace had discovered where <persName n="Hopper,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00326.01012" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was secreted, and would probably attack the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3493"/>In this emergency, the captain behaved nobly toward his hunted fellow-citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>He requested him to lie down flat in the bottom of a boat, which he himself entered and conducted to a brig bound for <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>The captain was a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New-England</placeName> man, but having been long engaged in Southern trade, his principles on the subject of slavery were adapted to his interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/>He gave the persecuted young traveller a most ungracious reception, and said if he thought he was an abolitionist he would send him directly back to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>However, the representations of <persName n="Nichols,Captain,,,," id="n0266.0048.00326.01013" reg="mostcommon:Nichols,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Nichols</surname></persName> induced him to consent that he should be put on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>They had a tedious passage of <measure n="35days" type="date">thirty-five days</measure>, during which there was a long and violent storm, <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> that seemed likely to wreck the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>The mob had robbed <persName n="Hopper,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00327.01014" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName> of his money and clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>He had no comfortable garments to shield him from the severe cold, and his hands and feet were frozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>At last, he arrived at <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, and went on board the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Benjamin Franklin</rs>, bound for <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/>There he had the good fortune to meet with a colored waiter, whose father had been redeemed from slavery by Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00327.01015" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>'s exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3503"/>He was assiduously devoted to the son of his benefactor, and did everything in his power to alleviate his distressed condition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>When the traveller arrived at his home, he was so haggard and worn down with danger and fatigue, that his family scarcely recognized him. His father was much excited and deeply affected, when he heard what perils he had gone through merely on account of his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>He soon after addressed the following letter to the mayor of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>:

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>Friend,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>My object in addressing thee is to express my heartfelt gratitude for thy exertions in saving the life of my son, which I have cause to believe was in imminent peril, from the violence of unreasonable men, while in your city a few weeks ago. I am informed that very soon after his arrival in <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> the fact became known to a marshal of this city, who was then there, and who, by his misrepresentations, excited the rabble to a determination to perpetrate the most inhuman outrage upon him, and in all probability to take his life; and that preparations were made, which, if carried into effect, would doubtless have produced that result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>Tar and feathers, as a mode of punishment, I am inclined to think is rather of modern invention; and I am doubtful whether they will be more efficient than whipping, cutting off ears, the rack, the halter, and the stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>Superstition and intolerance have long ago called in all these to their aid, in suppressing reformation in religion; but they were unable to accomplish the end designed; and if I am not greatly mistaken, they would prove entirely insufficient to stop the progress of emancipation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>If it is the determination of the people of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> to deliver up to a lawless and blood-thirsty mob every person coming among them whose sentiments are opposed to slavery, I apprehend there are very few at the <rs>North</rs> who would not be obnoxious to their hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>For I believe they all view slavery as an evil that must be abolished at no very distant day. Would it not be well for the people of the <rs>South</rs> to reflect upon the tendency of their conduct?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>Where such aggressions upon humanity are committed, the slaves will naturally inquire into the <pb id="p.329" n="329"/> cause; and when they are informed that it is in consequence of their oppressed and degraded condition, and that the persons thus persecuted are charged with being their friends, they cannot feel indifferent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/><num value="1">One</num> such scene as was witnessed in the case of my son would tend more to excite a spirit of insurrection and insubordination among them, than <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> <quote>incendiary pamphlets,</quote> not <num value="1">one</num> word of which any of them could read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>My son went to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> solely on his own private business, without any intention of interfering with the slaves, or with the subject of slavery in any way. But even supposing the charge to have been true, do not your laws award sufficient punishment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>How could you stand silently by, and witness proceedings that would put to blush the <name>Arab</name>, or the untutored inhabitant of the wilderness in our own country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>The negroes, whom you affect to despise so much, would set an example of benevolence and humanity, when on their own soil, if a stranger came among them, which you cannot be prepared to imitate, till you have made great improvements in civilization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>The people of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> profess Christianity; but what avails profession, where latitude is given to the vilest and most depraved passions of the human heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>Suppose the mob had murdered my son; a. young man who went among you in the ordinary course of his business, and who, even according to <pb id="p.330" n="330"/> <hi rend="italics">your</hi> understanding of the term, had done no evil; a young man of fair reputation, with numerous near relatives and friends to mourn over the barbarous deed; would you have been guiltless?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>I think the just witness in your consciences would answer No.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>I have long deplored the evils of slavery, and my sympathy has often been much excited for the master, as well as the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>I am aware of the difficulties attending the system, and I should rejoice if I could aid in devising some mode of relief, that would satisfy the claims of justice and humanity, and at the same time be acceptable to the inhabitants of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>It is certainly cause of deep regret that the <rs>Southern</rs> people suffer their angry passions to become so highly excited on this subject, which, of all others, ought to be calmly considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>For it remains a truth that <quote>the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,</quote> neither can it open his eyes to see in what his best interest consists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>O, that your ears may be open to the voice of wisdom before it is too late!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>The language of an eminent statesman, who was a slaveholder, often occurs to me: <quote>I tremble for my country when I reflect that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is just, and that his justice will not sleep forever.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>Surely we have high authority for believing that <quote>For the crying of the poor, and the sighing of <pb id="p.331" n="331"/> the needy, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> will arise.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>I hope I shall not be suspected of entertaining hostile or unkind feelings toward the people of the <rs>South</rs>, when I say that I believe slavery must and will be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>As sure as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is merciful and good, it is an evil that cannot endure forever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>An inspired apostle says, that our gracious Creator <quote>hath made of <num value="1">one</num> blood all nations of men;</quote> and our Saviour gave this commandment: <quote>As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>If we believe these declarations, and I hope none doubt their authority, I should think reasoning unnecessary to convince us that to oppress and enslave our fellow men cannot be pleasing to Him, who is just and equal in all his ways.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>My concern for the welfare of my fellow men is not confined to color, or circumscribed by geographical lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>I can never see human suffering without feeling compassion, and I would always gladly alleviate it, if I had it in my power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>I remember that we are all, without distinction of color or locality, children of the same Universal Parent, who delights to see the human family dwell together in peace and harmony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>I am strongly inclined to the opinion that the proceedings of that portion of the inhabitants of the <rs>North</rs> who are called abolitionists, would not produce so much agitation and excitement at the <rs>South</rs>, if the people there felt entirely satisfied that <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> slavery was justifiable in the sight of infinite purity and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>An eminent minister of the <name>Gospel</name>, about the middle of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century, often urged upon the attention of people this emphatic injunction: <quote>Mind the light</quote> <quote>All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>Now, if this light, or spirit of truth, <quote>a manifestation of which is given to every man to profit withal,</quote> should be found testifying in your consciences against injustice and oppression, regard its admonitions!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>It will let none remain at ease in their sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>It will justify for well doing; but to those who rebel against it, and disregard its reproofs, it will become the <quote>worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>I am aware that complaints are often made, because obstacles are thrown in the way of Southerners reclaiming their fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>But bring the matter home to yourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>Suppose a white man resided among you, who, for a series of years, had conducted with sobriety, industry, and probity, and had given frequent evidence of the kindness of his heart, by a disposition to oblige whenever opportunity offered; suppose he had a wife and children dependent upon him, and supported them comfortably and respectably; could you see that man dragged from his bed, and from the bosom of his family, in the dead time of night, manacled, and hurried away <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> into a distant part of the country, where his family could never see him again, and where they knew he must linger out a miserable existence, more intolerable than death, amid the horrors of slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>I ask whether you could witness all this, without the most poignant grief?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>This is no picture of the fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>It is a sober reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>The only difference is, the men thus treated are black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>But in my view, this does not diminish the horrors of such cruel deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>Can it be expected then, that the citizens of this state, or indeed of any other, would witness all this, without instituting the severest scrutiny into the legality of the proceedings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>More especially, when it is known that the persons employed in this nefarious business of hunting up fugitive slaves are men destitute of principle, whose hearts are callous as flint, and who would send a free man into bondage with as little compunction as they would a slave, if they could do it with impunity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>Of latter time, we hear much said about a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>Far better, in my view, that this should take place, if it can be effected without violence, than to remain as we are; when a peaceable citizen cannot enter your territory on his own lawful business, without the risk of being murdered by a ruthless mob.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>With reverent thankfulness to Him, who numbers the hairs of our heads, without whose notice not <pb id="p.334" n="334"/> even a sparrow falls to the ground, and to whose providence I consider myself indebted for the redemption of my beloved son from the hands of barbarians, permit me again to say that I feel sincerely grateful to thee and others, who kindly lent aid, though late, in rescuing him from the violence of unreasonable and wicked men, who sought his life without a cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>I may never have it in my power to do either of you personally a kindness; but some other member of the great family of mankind may need assistance in a way that I can relieve him. If this should be the case, I hope I shall not fail to embrace the opportunity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>With fervent desires that the beneficent Creator and Father of the <name>Universe</name> may open the eyes of all to see that <quote>the fast which he hath chosen is to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>Soon after the circumstances above related, the mayor of <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName> revoked the warrant of the marshal, who had been so conspicuous in the outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>This step was taken in consequence of his own admissions concerning his conduct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>In <dateStruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></dateStruct>, a little incident occurred, which may be interesting to those who are curious concerning phrenology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/><pb id="p.335" n="335"/> At a small social party in <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>, a discussion arose on that subject; and, as usual, some were disposed to believe and others to ridicule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>At last the disputants proposed to test the question by careful experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00335.01017" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the party, and they asked him to have his head examined by the well-known <persName n="Fowler,,O.,S.,," id="n0266.0048.00335.01018" reg="default:Fowler,O.,S.,,"><foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Fowler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>Having a good-natured willingness to gratify their curiosity, he consented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>It was agreed that he should not speak during the operation, lest the tones of his voice might serve as an index of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>It was further stipulated that no person in the room should give any indication by which the phrenologist might be enabled to judge whether he was supposed to be speaking correctly or not. The next day, <persName n="Fowler,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00335.01019" reg="nearbymention:Fowler,O.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fowler</surname></persName> was introduced blindfolded into a room, where <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00335.01020" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was seated with the party of the preceding evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>Having passed his hands over the strongly developed head, he made the following statement, which was taken down by a rapid writer, as the words fell from his lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p></p> 
<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and strongest manifestation of this character is efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> man in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> is capable of accomplishing so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>The strong points are very strong; the weak points are weak; so that he is an eccentric and peculiar character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>The pole-star of his character is moral courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/><pb id="p.336" n="336"/></p> 
<p>He has very little reverence, and stands in no awe of the powers that be. He pays no regard to forms or ceremonies, or established customs, in church or state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>He renders no homage to great names, such as D. D.; L. L.D.; or <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>He treats his fellow men with kindness and affection, but not with sufficient respect and courtesy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/>He is emphatically republican in feeling and character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>He makes himself free and familiar with every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>He often lets himself down too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3575"/>This constitutes a radical defect in his character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3576"/>He will assert and maintain human rights and liberty at every hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3577"/>In this cause, he will stake anything, or suffer anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3578"/>This constitutes the leading feature of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3579"/>Every other element is blended into this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3580"/>I should consider him a very cautious man in fact, though in appearance he is very imprudent; especially in remarks on moral subjects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3581"/>He is too apt to denounce those whom he considers in error; to apply opprobrious epithets and censure in the strongest terms, and the boldest manner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3582"/>I have seldom, if ever, met with a larger organ of conscientiousness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3583"/>Nothing so much delights him as to advocate and propagate moral principles; no matter how unpopular the principles may be. <pb id="p.337" n="337"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3584"/>He has very little credulity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3585"/>He is <num value="1">one</num> of the closest observers of men and things anywhere to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3586"/>He sees, as it were by intuition everything that passes around him, and understands just when and where to take men and things; just how and where to say things with effect; and in all he says, he speaks directly to the point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3587"/>He says and does a great many severe and cutting things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3588"/>If anybody else said and did such things, they would at once get into hot water; but he says and does them in such a manner, that even his enemies, and those against whom his censures are aimed, cannot be offended with him. He is always on the verge of difficulty, but never <hi rend="italics">in</hi> difficulty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3589"/>He is hated mainly by those not personally acquainted with him. A personal interview, even with his greatest enemies, generally removes enmity; because of the smoothness and easiness of his manners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3590"/>He has at command a great amount of welldi-gested information on almost every subject, and makes admirable use of his knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3591"/>He has a great many facts, and always brings them in their right place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3592"/>His general memory of particulars, incidents, places, and words, is really wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3593"/>But he has a weak memory concerning names, dates, <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> numbers, and colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3594"/>He never recognizes persons by their dress, or by the color of anything pertaining to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3595"/>He tells a story admirably, and acts it out to the life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3596"/>He makes a great deal of fun, and keeps others in a roar of laughter, while he is sober himself For his fun, he is as much indebted to the manner as to the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3597"/>He makes his jokes mainly by happy comparisons, striking illustrations, and the imitative power with which he expresses them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3598"/>He possesses a great amount of native talent, but it is so admirably distributed, that he appears to have more than he actually possesses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3599"/>His attachment to his friends is remarkably strong and ardent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3600"/>But he will associate with none except those whose moral characters are unimpeachable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3601"/>He expects and anticipates a great deal; enters largely into things; takes hold of every measure with spirit; and is always overwhelmed with business.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3603"/>That this description was remarkably accurate in most particulars will be obvious to those who have read the preceding anecdotes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3604"/>It is not true, however, that he was enthusiastic in character, or that he had the appearance of being so. He was far too <pb id="p.339" n="339"/> practical and self-possessed, to have the reputation of being <q direct="unspecified">half crazy,</q> even among those who are prone to regard everything as insane that is out of the common course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3605"/>Neither do I think he was accustomed to <q direct="unspecified">let himself down too much;</q> for according to my radical ideas, a man <hi rend="italics">cannot</hi> <q direct="unspecified">let himself down,</q> who <q direct="unspecified">associates only with those whose moral characters are unimpeachable.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3606"/>It is true that he was pleasant and playful in conversation with all classes of people; but he was remarkably free from any tinge of vulgarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>A proportionate reward was offered for the recovery of any part of the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3639"/>Though no names were mentioned, he had reason to conjecture that <persName n="Hughes,,Thomas,,," id="n0266.0048.00343.01038" reg="default:Hughes,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Hughes</surname></persName> might be the mulatto in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>He accordingly sought him out, read the advertisement to him, and inquired whether he had stolen anything from his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/>He denied having committed any theft, and said the pretence that he had done so was a mere trick, often resorted to by slaveholders, when they wanted to catch a runaway slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>That this remark was true, Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00343.01039" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> knew very well by his own experience; he therefore concluded it was likely that <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00343.01040" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was not guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3643"/>He expressed this conviction in conversation on the subject with <persName n="Corse,,Barney,,," id="n0266.0048.00343.01041" reg="default:Corse,Barney,,,"><foreName>Barney</foreName> <surname>Corse</surname></persName>, a benevolent member of the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>, who was kindly disposed toward the colored people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3646"/>The Friend then promised that he, and others who were interested for the slave, would do their utmost to obtain tidings of the money, and see it safely restored, on those conditions; but he expressly stipulated that he could not do it otherwise, because he had conscientious scruples, which would prevent him, in all cases, from helping to return a fugitive slave to his master.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3647"/>It is to be observed that the promise of manumission was given as the highest bribe that could be offered to induce the slave to refund the money he had taken; for though in argument slaveholders generally maintain that their slaves have no desire for freedom, they are never known to <hi rend="italics">act</hi> upon that supposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>In this case, the offer served a double purpose; for it stimulated the benevolent zeal of Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00344.01046" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> and <persName n="Corse,,Barney,,," id="n0266.0048.00344.01047" reg="default:Corse,Barney,,,"><foreName>Barney</foreName> <surname>Corse</surname></persName>, and induced the fugitive to confess what he had done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>He still denied that he had any intention of stealing, but declared that he took the money merely to obtain power over his master, hoping that the promise to restore it <pb id="p.345" n="345"/> would secure his manumission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>It is impossible to tell whether he spoke truth or not; for poor <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00345.01048" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> had been educated in a bad school of morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3651"/>Sold by his father, abused by his brother, and for years compelled to do the bidding of gamblers and slave-speculators, how could he be expected to have very clear perceptions of right and wrong?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3652"/>The circumstances of the case, however, seem to render it rather probable that he really was impelled by the motive which he assigned for his conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>The bank-bills he had purloined were placed in the hands of <num value="2">two</num> colored men in <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>, because, as he said, he could not return them himself, but must necessarily employ somebody to do it for him, in the intended process of negotiating for his freedom.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>In the first place, they greatly desired to secure the manumission of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>In the second place, the honesty of their characters led them to wish that the master should recover what was his own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>But, by careful and judicious management, they soon recovered nearly <measure n="6000dollars" type="currency">six thousand dollars</measure>, which was immediately placed in <num value="1">one</num> of the principal banks of the city, with a full statement of the circumstances of the case to the cashier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>Over <num value="1000">one thousand</num> more was heard of as having been deposited with a colored man in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>He agreed to do so; but he deemed it prudent to have a previous interview with <persName n="Darg,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00346.01057" reg="nearbymention:Darg,John,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Darg</surname></persName>, to obtain his written promise to manumit <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00346.01058" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, to pay the necessary expenses of the journey, and to exonerate from criminal prosecution any person or persons connected with the robbery, provided that assurance proved necessary in order to get possession of the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3768"/>It was urged that her condition would be most miserable <pb id="p.359" n="359"/> with the <q direct="unspecified">free niggers</q> of the <rs>North</rs>, even if the abolitionists did not sell her, or spirit her away to some unknown region.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>On the other hand, the colored people, who had assembled about the court-room, were very eager to rescue her from slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3770"/>She did not understand their motives, or those of the abolitionists; for they had been diligently misrepresented to her. <q direct="unspecified">What do they want to do it <hi rend="italics">for</hi>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3772"/>She was afraid there was some selfish motive concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3780"/></p> 
<p>The <rs>Southerner</rs> said something about its being <pb id="p.360" n="360"/> both mean and wrong to come between master and servant.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/><q direct="unspecified">You are no gentleman,</q> responded the other, in an irritated tone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/><q direct="unspecified">I don't profess to be a gentleman,</q> answered the impassive <rs>Quaker</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3799"/><q direct="unspecified">But I am an honest old man; and perhaps that will do as well.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3800"/></p> 
<p>This remark occasioned a general smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>Indeed it was pleasant to observe, throughout this scene in the court-room, that popular sympathy was altogether on the side of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3802"/>It was a strange blind instinct on the part of the people, considering how diligently they had been instructed otherwise by pulpit and press; but so it was.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3803"/>When the slave was summoned into the judge's room, Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00361.01119" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> followed; being extremely desirous to have her understand her position clearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>He found <persName n="Morgan,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00361.01120" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> and his Southern friend in close and earnest conversation with her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3805"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">I did not push thee,</q> said Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00361.01121" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>; <q direct="unspecified">and see that thou dost not push <hi rend="italics">me</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/>He then inquired of the woman if he had rightly understood that her husband was free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/><q direct="unspecified">Then let me tell thee,</q> said the kind-hearted old gentleman, <q direct="unspecified">that we will send for him, and obtain <pb id="p.362" n="362"/> employment for him here, if it is thy choice to remain.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3809"/></p> 
<p>Again she wept, and repeated, <q direct="unspecified">I do want to be free.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3810"/>But she was evidently bewildered and distrustful, and did not know how to understand the opposite professions that were made to her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3811"/>On representation of the claimant's friends, <persName n="Oakley,Judge,,,," id="n0266.0048.00362.01122" reg="mostcommon:Oakley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Oakley</surname></persName> adjourned the case till the next morning; telling the woman she was at liberty to go with whom she pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3812"/>The colored people had assembled in considerable numbers, and were a good deal excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3813"/>Experience led them to suppose that she would either be cajoled into consenting to return to slavery, or else secretly packed off to <placeName key="tgn,7014214" n="1.000 21" reg="new orleans, orleans, louisiana">New-Orleans</placeName>, if she were left in Southern hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3814"/>They accordingly made haste to hustle her away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3815"/>But their well-intended zeal terrified the poor bewildered creature, and she escaped from them, and went back to her mistress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3816"/>The pro-slavery papers chuckled, as they always do, when some poor ignorant victim is deceived by false representation, alarmed by an excitement that she does not comprehend, afraid that strangers are not telling her the truth, or that they&mdash;have not the power to protect her; and in continual terror of future punishment, if she should attempt to take her freedom, and yet be unable to maintain it. Great is the triumph of republicans, when, under such trying <pb id="p.363" n="363"/> circumstances, <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> poor bewildered wretch goes back to slavery; but of the <hi rend="italics">hundreds</hi>, who every month take their freedom, through fire and flood, and all manner of deadly perils, they are as silent as the grave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3817"/>In the spring of <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>, I went to <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName> to edit the <rs>Anti-Slavery Standard</rs>, and took up my abode with the family of <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00363.01123" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3818"/>The zealous theological controversy among Friends naturally subsided after the separation between the opposing parties had become an old and settled fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3819"/>Consequently the demand for <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> books diminished more and more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3820"/>The Anti-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">Slavery Society</orgName>, at that time, needed a Treasurer and Book-Agent; and Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00363.01124" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was proposed as a suitable person for that office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3821"/>As only a small portion of his time was occupied with the sale of books he had on hand, he concluded to accept the proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3822"/>He was then nearly <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> old; but he appeared at least <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> younger, in person and manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3823"/>His firm, elastic step seemed like a vigorous man of <num value="50">fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>He would spring from the <name>Bowery</name> cars, while they were in motion, with as much agility as a lad of <num value="14">fourteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>His hair was not even sprinkled with gray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3826"/>It looked so black and glossy, that a young lady, who was introduced to him, said she thought he wore a wig unnaturally dark for his age. It was a favorite joke of his to make strangers believe he <pb id="p.364" n="364"/> wore a wig; and they were not easily satisfied that he spoke in jest, until they examined his head.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>The roguery of his boyhood had subsided into a love of little mischievous tricks; and the playful tone of humor, that rippled through his conversation, frequently reminded me of the <rs>Cheeryble Brothers</rs>, so admirably described by <persName n="Dickens,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00364.01125" reg="mostcommon:Dickens,nomatch:0"><surname>Dickens</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>If some <num value="1">one</num> rang at the door, and inquired for <persName n="Hopper,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00364.01126" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>, he always answered, <q direct="unspecified">There is no such person lives here.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>If the stranger urged that he had been directed by a man who said he knew <persName n="Hopper,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00364.01127" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>, he would persevere in saying, <q direct="unspecified">There must be some mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>No such person lives here.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3831"/>At last, when the disappointed visitor turned to go away, he would call out, <q direct="unspecified">Perhaps thou means <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00364.01128" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>?

<p>Being called upon to give a receipt to a Catholic priest for some money deposited in his hands, he simply wrote <q direct="unspecified">Received of <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0266.0048.00364.01129" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3836"/><q direct="unspecified">However, I will try to oblige thee.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>He took another slip of paper, and wrote, <q direct="unspecified">Received of <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0266.0048.00364.01132" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, who <hi rend="italics">calls</hi> himself the <rs>Reverend</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>The priest smiled, and accepted <pb id="p.365" n="365"/> the compromise; being well aware that the pleasantry originated in no personal or sectarian prejudice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>He always had something facetious to say to the people with whom he traded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>The oyster-men, the coal-men, and the women at the fruit-stalls in his neighborhood, all knew him as a pleasant old gentleman, always ready for a joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>If anybody else had done it, there would have been a great fuss made about it; but you are a privileged man, <persName n="Hopper,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00365.01133" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>The woman had a good laugh, and he came home as pleased as a boy, to think how completely his serious manner had deceived her. <pb id="p.366" n="366"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>She asked him to wait till the gentleman came; but he continued to beseech that she would take compassion on him. The girl began to be frightened by his importunity, and looked anxiously toward the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>To his uneducated senses, it seemed to be a living creature, and he screamed violently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>It was several hours before he recovered from his extreme terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3985"/>When his parents returned, he tried to make them understand <pb id="p.376" n="376"/> how a strange thing had come into the house, and run, and jumped, and made a noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>But his lisping language was so very imperfect, that they were unable to conjecture what had so frightened him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>He resisted having <num value="1">one</num> of more modern construction, because he said that pleasantly reminded him of the time when he was a boy, and used to drive the cows to pasture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>Sometimes, he rang it much longer than was necessary to summon the household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>On such occasions, I often observed him smiling while he stood shaking the bell; and he would say, <q direct="unspecified">I am thinking how <persName n="Polly,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00376.01156" reg="mostcommon:Polly,nomatch:0"><surname>Polly</surname></persName> looked, when the cow kicked her over; milk-pail and all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3995"/></p> 
<p>But clearly above all other things, did he remember every look and tone of his beloved <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>; even in the days when they trudged to school together, hand in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>The recollection of this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> love, closely intertwined with his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> religious impressions, was the only flowery spot of romance in the old gentleman's very practical character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>When he was <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> of age, he showed me a piece of writing she had copied for him, when she was a girl of <num value="14">fourteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4004"/>She not only <q direct="unspecified">listened to a sister's praises with unwounded ear,</q> but often added a heartfelt tribute to the virtues of her departed friend.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4005"/>It is very common for old people to grow careless about their personal appearance, and their style of <pb id="p.378" n="378"/> conversation; but Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00378.01157" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was remarkably free from such faults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4006"/>He was exceedingly pure in his mind, and in his personal habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4007"/>He never alluded to any subject that was unclean, never made any indelicate remark, or used any unseemly expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4008"/>There was never the slightest occasion for young people to feel uneasy concerning what he might say. However lively his mood might be, his fun was always sure to be restrained by the nicest sense of natural propriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4009"/>He shaved, and took a cold plunge-bath every day. Not a particle of mud or dust was allowed to remain upon his garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4010"/>He always insisted on blacking his own shoes; for it was <num value="1">one</num> of his principles not to be waited upon, while he was well enough to wait upon himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4011"/>They were always as polished as japan; and every <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, his silver buckles were made as bright as a new dollar, in readiness to go to meeting the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>At the time I knew him, I believe he was the only <rs>Quaker</rs> in the country, who had not departed from that model in the slightest degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>It was in fact the dress of all <name>English</name> gentlemen, in <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>'s time; and the only peculiarity of <persName n="Penn,,William,,," id="n0266.0048.00378.01159" reg="default:Penn,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Penn</surname></persName> was, that he wore it without embroidery or ornament of any kind, for the purpose of protesting against the extravagance of the fashionable <pb id="p.379" n="379"/> world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4014"/>Therefore, the <hi rend="italics">spirit</hi> of his intention and that of other early Friends, would be preserved by wearing dress cut according to the prevailing mode, but of plain materials, and entirely unornamented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/>However, Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00379.01160" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was attached to the ancient costume from early association, and he could not quite banish the idea that any change in it would be a degree of conformity to the fashions of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>The long stockings, and small clothes buckled at the knee, were well adapted to his finely formed limbs; and certainly he and his lady-like <persName n="Hannah,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00379.01161" reg="mostcommon:Hannah,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannah</surname></persName>, in their quaint garb of the olden time, formed a very agreeable picture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>He had no peculiarities with regard to eating or drinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>He always followed the old-fashioned substantial mode of living, to which he had been accustomed in youth, and of which moderation in all things was the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>For luxuries he had no taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4020"/>He thought very little about his food; but when it was before him, he ate with the vigorous appetite natural to strong health and very active habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4021"/>When his health failed for a time in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and he seemed wasting away to a shadow, his physician recommended tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4022"/>He found great benefit from it, and in consequence of the habit then formed he became an inveterate smoker, and continued so till he was past <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> old. <pb id="p.380" n="380"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4023"/>Being out of health for a short time, at that period, the doctor told him he thought smoking was not good for his complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4024"/>He accordingly discontinued the practice, and formed a resolution not to renew it. When he recovered, it cost him a good deal of physical annoyance to conquer the long-settled habit; but he had sufficient strength of mind to persevere in the difficult task, and he never again used tobacco in any form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4025"/>Speaking of this to his son <persName><foreName>Edward</foreName></persName>, he said, <q direct="unspecified">The fact is, whoever cures himself of any selfish indulgence, becomes a better man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4026"/></p> 
<p>He was eminently domestic in his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>Perhaps no man ever lived, who better enjoyed staying at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>He loved to invite his grandchildren, and write them pleasant little notes about the squirrel-pie, or some other rarity, which he had in preparation for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4029"/>He seldom went out of his own family circle, except on urgent business, or to attend to some call of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4030"/>He was always very attentive in waiting upon his wife to meeting, or elsewhere, and spent a large portion of his evenings in reading to her from the newspapers, or some book of Travels, or the writings of early Friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4031"/>No man in the country had such a complete <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>He contrived to pick up every rare old <pb id="p.381" n="381"/> volume connected with the history of his sect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>He had a wonderful fondness and reverence for many of those books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>They seemed to stand to him in the place of old religious friends, who had parted from his side in the journey of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>There, at least, he found Quakerism that had not degenerated; that breathed the same spirit as of yore.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>I presume that his religious opinions resembled those of <persName n="Hicks,,Elias,,," id="n0266.0048.00381.01162" reg="default:Hicks,Elias,,,"><foreName>Elias</foreName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>But I judged so mainly from incidental remarks; for he regarded doctrines as of small importance, and considered theology an unprofitable topic of conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>Practical righteousness, manifested in the daily affairs of life, was in his view the sum and substance of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>The doctrine of the <name>Atonement</name> never commended itself to his reason, and his sense of justice was disturbed by the idea of the innocent suffering for the guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>He moreover thought it had a pernicious tendency for men to rely on an abstract article of faith, to save them from their sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>With the stern and gloomy sects, who are peculiarly attracted by the character of Deity as delineated in the Old Testament, he had no sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>The Infinite <num value="1">One</num> was ever present to his mind, as a loving Father to all his children, whether they happened to call him by the name of Brama, Jehovah, <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, or Allah.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>He was strongly attached to the forms of Quakerism, <pb id="p.382" n="382"/> as well as to the principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>It troubled him, when some of his children changed their mode of dress, and ceased to say <hi rend="italics">thee</hi> and <hi rend="italics">thou</hi>. He groaned when <num value="1">one</num> of his daughters appeared before him with a black velvet bonnet, though it was exceedingly simple in construction, and unornamented by feather or ribbon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>She was prepared for this reception, and tried to reconcile him to the innovation by representing that a white or drab-colored silk bonnet showed every stain, and was therefore very uneconomical for a person of active habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/><q direct="unspecified">Thy good mother was a very energetic woman,</q> he replied; <q direct="unspecified">but she found no difficulty in keeping her white bonnet as nice as a new pin.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>His daughter urged that it required a great deal of trouble to keep it so; and that she did not think dress was worth so much trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4048"/>But his groan was only softened into a sigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>The fashion of the bonnet his <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName> had worn, in that beloved old meeting-house at <placeName reg="Woodbury, Butler, Kentucky" key="tgn,2042029">Woodbury</placeName>, was consecrated in his memory; and to his mind, the outward type also stood for an inward principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>I used to tell him that I found something truly grand in the original motive for saying <hi rend="italics">thee</hi> and <hi rend="italics">thou;</hi> but it seemed to me that it had degenerated into a mere hereditary habit, since the custom of applying <hi rend="italics">you</hi> exclusively to superiors had vanished from the <rs>English</rs> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>He admitted the force of this argument; but he deprecated <pb id="p.383" n="383"/> a departure from their old forms, because he considered it useful, especially to the young, to carry the cross of being marked and set apart from the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/>But though he was thus strict in what he required of those who had been educated as <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>, he placed no barrier between himself and people of other sects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4053"/>He loved a righteous man, and sympathized with an unfortunate <num value="1">one</num>, without reference to his denomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4054"/>In fact, many of his warmest and dearest friends were not members of his own religious society.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4055"/>Early in life he formed an unfavorable opinion of the effect of capital punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>His <persName><roleName n="Uncle">uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tatum</foreName></persName> considered it a useful moral lesson to take all his apprentices to hear the tragedy of <persName n="Barnwell,,George,,," id="n0266.0048.00383.01163" reg="default:Barnwell,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Barnwell</surname></persName>, and to witness public executions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4057"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions, he saw <num value="5">five</num> men hung at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>His habits of shrewd observation soon led him to conclude that such spectacles generally had a very hardening and bad influence on those who witnessed them, or heard them much talked about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>In riper years, his mind was deeply interested in the subject, and he read and reflected upon it a great deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>The result of his investigations was a settled conviction that executions did not tend to diminish crime, but rather to increase it, by their demoralizing effect on the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/>He regarded them with abhorrence, <pb id="p.384" n="384"/> as a barbarous custom, entirely out of place in a civilized country and a Christian age.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4062"/>Concerning the rights of women, he scarcely needed any new light from modern theories; for, as a Quaker, he had been early accustomed to practical equality between men and women in all the affairs of the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4063"/>He had always been in the habit of listening to them as preachers, and of meeting them on committees with men, for education, for the care of the poor, for missions to the <name>Indians</name>, and for financial regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4064"/>Therefore, it never occurred to him that there was anything unseemly in a woman's using any gift with which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had endowed her, or transacting any business, which she had the ability to do well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4065"/>After his removal to <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>, incidents now and then occurred, which formed pleasant links with his previous life in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4066"/>Sometimes slaves, whom he had rescued many years before, or convicts, whom he had encouraged to lead a better life, called to see him and express their gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4067"/>Sometimes their children came to bless him. There was <num value="1">one</num> old colored woman, who never could meet him without embracing him. Although these demonstrations were not always convenient, and did not partake of the quiet character of <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> discipline, he would never say anything to repress the overflowings of her warm old heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4068"/>As <num value="1">one</num> of his sons passed <pb id="p.385" n="385"/> through <placeName reg="Bond-street">Bond-street</placeName>, he saw an old colored man rubbing his knees, and making the most lively gesticulations of delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4069"/>Being asked what was the matter, he pointed across the street, and exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">O, if I was only sure that was Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00385.01164" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4070"/>If I was only <hi rend="italics">sure</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4071"/>When told that he was not mistaken, he rushed up to the old gentleman, threw his arms about his neck, and hugged him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4072"/>When I told him of Julia Pell, a colored <name>Methodist</name> preacher, whose fervid untutored eloquence had produced an exciting effect on my mind, he invited her to come and take tea with him. In the course of conversation, he discovered that she was the daughter of <persName><foreName>Zeke</foreName></persName>, the slave who outwitted his purchaser; as described in the preceding narratives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4073"/>It was quite an interesting event in her life to meet with the man who had written her father's manumission papers, while she was in her infancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4074"/>When the parting hour came, she said she felt moved to pray; and dropping on her knees, she poured forth a brief but very earnest prayer, at the close of which she said: <q direct="unspecified">O <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, I beseech thee to shower down blessings on that good old man, whom thou hast raised up to do such a blessed work for my down-trodden people.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4075"/></p> 
<p>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00385.01165" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>'s fund of anecdotes, especially with regard to colored people, was almost inexhaustible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4076"/><pb id="p.386" n="386"/> He related them with so much animation, that he was constantly called upon to repeat them, both at public meetings and in private conversation; and they never failed to excite lively interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4077"/>Every stranger, who was introduced to him, tried to draw him out; and it was an easy matter; for he loved to oblige people, and it is always pleasant for an old soldier to fight his battles over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4078"/>In this readiness to recount his own exploits, there was nothing that seemed like silly or obtrusive vanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4079"/>It often reminded me of the following just remark in the <rs>Westminster Review</rs>, applied to <persName n="Bentham,,Jeremy,,," id="n0266.0048.00386.01166" reg="default:Bentham,Jeremy,,,"><foreName>Jeremy</foreName> <surname>Bentham</surname></persName>: <q direct="unspecified">The very egotism in which he occasionally indulged was a manifestation of a <hi rend="italics">want</hi> of self-thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/>This unpopular failing is, after all, <num value="1">one</num> of the characteristics of a natural and simple mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>It requires much <hi rend="italics">thought</hi> about <num value="1">one</num>'s self to <hi rend="italics">avoid</hi> speaking of <num value="1">one</num>'s self.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4082"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4086"/>I have heard it stated that <num value="1000000">millions</num> of money were thus invested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4089"/>But where was the need of being so active in the cause, as <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00387.01173" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName> was, and always had been?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4092"/>It is astonishing how troublesome a living soul proves to be, when they try to shut it up within the narrow limits of a drowsy sect!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4093"/>I had a friend in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, whose wealthy and aristocratic parents brought him up according to the most approved model of genteel religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4094"/>He learned the story of the <rs>Good Samaritan</rs>, and was early accustomed to hear eulogies pronounced on the holy <rs>Jesus</rs>, who loved the poor, and associated with the despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4098"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4099"/>He had imbibed anti-slavery principles in full flood at the fountain of Quakerism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4100"/>Their best and greatest men were conspicuous as advocates of those principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/>Children were taught to revere those men, and their testimonies were laid up in honorable preservation, to be quoted with solemn formality on safe occasions.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4103"/>That many of the modern <rs>Quakers</rs> should be blinded by bales of cotton, heaped up between their souls and the divine light, is not remarkable; for cotton is an impervious material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>But it is a strange anomaly in their history that any <num value="1">one</num> among them should have considered himself guided by the <name>Spirit</name> to undertake the especial mission of discouraging sympathy with the enslaved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>A minister belonging to that branch of the <name>Society</name> called <q direct="unspecified">Hicksites,</q> who usually preached in <placeName reg="Rose-street">Rose-street</placeName> Meeting, New-York, had imbibed very strong prejudices against all modern reforms: and he manifested his aversion with a degree of excitement, in language, tone, and gesture, <pb id="p.389" n="389"/> very unusual in that quiet sect.

<p>The state of things among <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName> in the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New-York</placeName> may be inferred from the fact that this minister was exceedingly popular, and his style of preaching cordially approved by a majority of them.

<p>The principal argument brought by Friends, against their members uniting with Anti-Slavery Societies, was that they were thus led to mix indiscriminately with people of other denominations, and brought into contact with hireling clergymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>But so many cases press upon my attention, and it is so difficult to examine them all thoroughly, that it is a great relief to find a man in whose judgment and integrity I have such perfect confidence, as I have in yours.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4311"/>On the occasion of <num value="1">one</num> of these applications for mercy, the following quaint correspondence passed between him and the <rs>Governor</rs>: 
<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>Esteemed Friend,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4313"/>John Young:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>Thou mayst think this mode of address rather too familiar; but as it is the spontaneous effusion of my heart, and entirely congenial with my feelings, I hope thou wilt hold me excused.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4315"/>Permit me to embrace this opportunity to congratulate <pb id="p.414" n="414"/> thee upon thy accession to the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs></orgName> of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/>I rejoice that thou hast had independence enough to restore to liberty, and to their families, those infatuated men called Anti-Renters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4318"/>Some, who live under the old dispensation, that demanded <quote>an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,</quote> will doubtless censure this act of justice and mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>But another class will be glad; those who have embraced the <rs>Christian</rs> faith, and live under the benign influence of its spirit, which enjoins forgiveness of injuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>The approbation of such, accompanied with an approving conscience, will, I trust, more than counterbalance any censure that may arise on the occasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>The object I particularly have in view in addressing thee now, is, to call thy attention to the case of <persName n="Lee,,Allen,,," id="n0266.0048.00414.01256" reg="default:Lee,Allen,,,"><foreName>Allen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who was sentenced to <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> imprisonment for horse-stealing, in <placeName reg="Westchester, New York, United States" key="tgn,7014612">Westchester County</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>It is his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offence, and he has conducted well during his confinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>His health is much impaired, and he has several times had a slight hemorrhage of the lungs.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4331"/>I have often thought of thee since we last met. I have received thy letter; and because thou hast written to me, and because I know that what thou writest is always truth, and that the old man, before he lays him down to die, may behold the face of his son, I will restore <persName n="Allen,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00415.01262" reg="mostcommon:Allen,Richard,,,:3"><surname>Allen</surname></persName> to his kindred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4332"/>When thou comest to <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, I pray thee to come and see me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>The monitor within frequently impelled Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00415.01264" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> to address the assembled convicts at <placeName key="tgn,2071503" n="1.000 7" reg="ossining, westchester, new york">Sing Sing</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/>The officers of the establishment were very willing to open the way for him; for according to the testimony of <persName n="Eldridge,Mister,Harman,,," id="n0266.0048.00415.01265" reg="default:Eldridge,Harman,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Harman</foreName> <surname>Eldridge</surname></persName>, the warden, <q direct="unspecified">With all his kindness, and the encouragement he was always ready to give, he was guarded and cautious in the extreme, that nothing <pb id="p.416" n="416"/> should be said to conflict with the discipline of the prison.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>His exhortations rendered the prisoners more docile, and stimulated them to exertion by keeping hope alive in their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>On such occasions, I have been told that a large portion of his unhappy audience were frequently moved to tears; and the warmth of their grateful feelings was often manifested by eagerly pressing forward to shake hands with him, whenever they received permission to do so. The friendly counsel he gave on such occasions sometimes produced a permanent effect on their characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>In a letter to his daughter <persName><foreName>Susan</foreName></persName>, he says: <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">One</num> of these poor fellows attacked the life of the keeper, and I soon after had a private interview with him. He received what I said kindly, but declared that he could not govern his temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>He said he had no ill &mdash; will toward the keeper; that what he did was done in a gust of passion, and he could not help it. I tried to convince him that he had power to control his temper, if he would only exercise it. A year and <num value="0.5">a half</num> afterward, on <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Day, after meeting, he asked permission to speak to me. He then told me he was convinced that what I had said to him was true; for he had not given way to anger since I talked to him on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/>He showed me many certificates from the keepers, all testifying to his good conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>I hardly ever saw a man more changed than he is.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/><pb id="p.417" n="417"/></p> 
<p>I often heard my good old friend describe these scenes in the <rs type="place">Prison Chapel</rs>, with much emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>He used to say, the feeling of confidence and safety which prevailed, was sometimes presented to his mind in forcible contrast with the state of things in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, as related by his worthy friend, <persName n="Rogers,Doctor,William,,," id="n0266.0048.00417.01266" reg="default:Rogers,William,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, who was on the committee of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Society formed in this country <q direct="unspecified">for relieving the miseries of public prisons.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>That kind-hearted and conscientious clergyman proposed to address some religious exhortation to the prisoners, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4344"/>But the keeper was so unfriendly to the exertion of such influence, that he assured him his life would be in peril, and the prisoners would doubtless escape, to rob and murder the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4345"/>When an order was granted by the sheriff for the performance of religious services, he obeyed it very reluctantly; and he actually had a loaded cannon mounted near the clergyman, and a man standing ready with a lighted match all the time he was preaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>His audience were arranged in a solid column, directly in front of the cannon's mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>This is supposed to have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sermon addressed to the assembled inmates of a <placeName reg="State Prison">State Prison</placeName> in this country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>Notwithstanding Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00417.01267" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>'s extreme benevolence, he was rarely imposed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4349"/>He made it a rule to give very little money to discharged convicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4350"/><pb id="p.418" n="418"/> He paid their board till employment could be obtained, and when they wished to go to their families, in distant places, he procured free passage for them in steamboats or cars; which his influence with captains and conductors enabled him to do very easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4351"/>If they wanted to work at a trade, he purchased tools, and hired a shop, when circumstances seemed to warrant such expenditure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4352"/>After they became well established in business, they were expected to repay these loans, for the benefit of others in the same unfortunate condition they had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>Of course, some who expected to receive money whenever they told a pitiful story, were disappointed and vexed by these prudential regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4354"/>Among the old gentleman's letters, I find <num value="1">one</num> containing these expressions: <q direct="unspecified">When I heard you talk in the <rs type="place">Prison Chapel</rs>, I thought there was something for the man that had once left the path of honesty to hope for from his fellow-men; but I find that I was greatly mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4355"/>You are men of words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4356"/>You can do the wind-work <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4357"/>But when a man wants a little assistance to get work, and get an honest living, you are not there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4358"/>Now I wish to know where your philanthropy is.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4359"/></p> 
<p>But such instances were exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4360"/>As a general rule, gratitude was manifested for the assistance rendered in time of need; though it was always limited to the urgent necessities of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/><num value="1">One</num> day, <pb id="p.419" n="419"/> the following letter, enclosing a dollar bill for the <name>Association</name>, was addressed to <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00419.01268" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>: <q direct="unspecified">Should the humble mite here enclosed be the means of doing <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> part the good to any poor convict that the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> of a dollar has done for me, which I received through your hands more than once, when I was destitute of money or friends, then I shall have my heart's desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/></p> 
<p>From the numerous cases under Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00419.01269" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>'s care, while <rs type="role" reg="Agent">Agent</rs> of the <orgName n="Prison Association" type="association">Prison Association</orgName>, I will select a few; but I shall disguise the names, because the individuals are living, and I should be sorry to wound their feelings by any unnecessary exposure of past delinquences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4364"/>C.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4365"/>When Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00419.01270" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> inquired whether it was his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offence, he frankly answered, <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">No.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4368"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Thou art still very young,</q> rejoined Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00419.01271" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>; <q direct="unspecified">and it seems a large portion of thy life has been spent in prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4369"/>I am afraid thou art a bad man. But I hope thou seest the error of thy ways, <pb id="p.420" n="420"/> and art now determined to do better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>Hast thou any friends?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/></p> 
<p>He replied, <q direct="unspecified">I have a mother; a poor hardwork-ing woman, who sells fruit and candies in the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>If you will give me a start, I will try to lead an honest life henceforth; for I want to be a comfort and support to her. I have no other friend in the world, and nobody to help me. When I left prison, I was advised to come to you. I am a shoemaker; and if I had money to buy a set of tools, I would work at my trade, and take care of my mother.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/></p> 
<p>Necessary tools were procured for him, and he seemed very grateful; saying it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in his life that he had found any <num value="1">one</num> willing to help him to be honest, when he came out of prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>Great doubts were entertained of the success of this case; because the man had been so many times convicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>But he occasionally called at the office, and always appeared sober and respectable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4376"/>A few months after his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduction, he sent Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00420.01272" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> a letter from <placeName reg="Oswego, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,7014317">Oswego</placeName>, enclosing <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">seven dollars</measure> for his mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4377"/>He immediately delivered it, and returned with a cheerful heart to enter it on his Record; adding, <q direct="unspecified">The poor old woman was much pleased that her son remembered her, and said she believed he was now going to do well.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4378"/></p> 
<p>After that, C. R. frequently sent <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> to his mother, through the same channel, and <pb id="p.421" n="421"/> paid her rent punctually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4379"/>He refunded all the money the <name>Association</name> had lent him, and made some small donations, in token of gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4380"/>Having behaved in a very exemplary manner during <measure n="4.5years" type="date">four years and a half</measure>, Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00421.01273" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>, at his earnest request, applied to the <rs>Governor</rs> to have all the rights of citizenship restored to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4382"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4388"/>He endeavored to establish a good character, and was so fortunate as to gain the affections of a very orderly, industrious young woman, whom he soon after married.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4389"/>In his Register, Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00422.01276" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> thus describes a visit to them, little more than a year after he was discharged from prison: <q direct="unspecified">I called yesterday to visit M.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4404"/>Inquiries were made of the <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen in whose employ he had been more than a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4405"/>They said they had found him capable, industrious, and faithful; and their distrust <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> of him was founded solely on the fact of his being a discharged convict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4411"/>He urged his subsequent <pb id="p.425" n="425"/> good conduct, and the apparent sincerity of his efforts to build up a reputation for honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>He finally put the case home to him, by asking how he would like to have others conduct toward a son of his own, under similar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4413"/>It was a point of view from which the gentleman had never before considered the question, and his mind was somewhat impressed by it; but his prejudices were not easily overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4414"/>Meanwhile, the druggist was very willing to receive the young man back again; and he returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4415"/>It seems as if it would have been almost impossible for him to have avoided sinking into the depths of discouragement and desperation, if he had not received timely assistance from the <orgName n="Prison Association" type="association">Prison Association</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4416"/>How highly he appreciated their aid may be inferred from the following letter to <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00425.01280" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4419"/>I was the more gratified <pb id="p.426" n="426"/> because my dear wife was present with me, and also my brother-in-law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4420"/>Oh, what a noble work the <name>Society</name> is engaged in. My most fervent prayer is that your name may remain on its list for many years to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>They taunted him with having been a convict, and threw all manner of obstacles in the way of his making an honest living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4426"/>Among other persecutions, a suit at law was instituted against him, which cost him <measure n="75dollars" type="currency">seventy-five dollars</measure>. The charge was entirely without foundation, and when brought before the court, was promptly dismissed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4429"/>She went to live with an aunt, who kept a boarding-house in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4430"/>According to her own account, she was harshly treated, and frequently taunted with the circumstances of her birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4431"/>At the early age of <num value="14">fourteen</num>, <num value="1">one</num> of the boarders offered to marry her, and induced her to leave the house with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4432"/>She was strongly attached to him, and being a capable, industrious girl, she kept everything nice and bright about their lodgings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4433"/>He pretended to have a great deal of business in <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>; but in fact his frequent visits to that city were for purposes of gambling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4434"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of those occasions, when he had been absent much longer than usual, she followed him, and found him living with another woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4435"/>He very coolly informed her that the marriage-ceremony between them was a mere sham; the person who performed it not having been invested with any legal authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4436"/>Thus betrayed, deserted, and friendless, the poor young creature became almost frantic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4437"/>In that desperate state of mind, she was decoyed by a woman, who kept a disreputable house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4438"/>A short career of reckless <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> frivolity and vice ended, as usual, in the hospital on <placeName reg="Roosevelt Island, New York, New York" key="tgn,2628523">Blackwell's Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4439"/>When she was discharged, she tried to drown her sorrow and remorse in intemperance, and went on ever from bad to worse, till she became a denizen of <placeName key="possibilities=131" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Five Points</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4440"/>In her brief intervals of sobriety, she was thoroughly disgusted with herself, and earnestly desired to lead a better life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4441"/>Being turned into the street <num value="1">one</num> night, in a state of intoxication, she went to the prison called The Tombs, because its architecture is in imitation of the ancient sepulchral halls of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4442"/>She humbly asked permission to enter this gloomy abode, in hopes that some of the ladies connected with the <orgName n="Prison Association" type="association">Prison Association</orgName> would visit her, and find some decent employment for her. Her case being represented to Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00428.01282" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>, he induced his wife to take her into the family, as a domestic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4443"/>As soon as she entered the house, she said, <q direct="unspecified">I don't want to deceive you. I will tell you everything.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4444"/>And she told all the particulars of her history, without attempting to veil any of its deformity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4445"/>She was very industrious, and remarkably tidy in her habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4446"/>She kept the kitchen extremely neat, and loved to decorate it with little ornaments, especially with flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4447"/>Poor shattered soul!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4448"/>Who can tell into what blossom of poetry that little germ might have expanded, if it had been kindly nurtured under gentle and refining influences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4449"/>She behaved very well for several <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> months, and often expressed gratitude that she could now feel as if she had a home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4450"/>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00429.01283" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> took great interest in her, and had strong hopes that she would become a respectable woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4451"/>Before a year expired, she relapsed into intemperate habits for a time; but he overlooked it, and encouraged her to forget it. As she often expressed a great desire to see her cousins in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, he called upon them, and told the story of her reformation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4452"/>They sent some little presents, accompanied with friendly messages, and after a while invited her to visit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4453"/>For a time, it seemed as if the excursion had done her good, both physically and mentally; but the sight of respectable relatives, with husbands and children, made her realize more fully the utter loneliness of her own position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4454"/>She used opium in large quantities, and had dreadful fits in consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4455"/>Sometimes, she stole out of the house in the evening, and was taken up by the police in a state of intoxication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4456"/>When she recovered her senses, she would be very humble, and during an interval of weeks, or months, would make an effort to behave extremely well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4457"/>I forget how often Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00429.01284" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> received her back, after she had spent the night in the <rs type="place">Station House</rs>; but it was many, many times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4458"/>His patience held out long after everybody else was completely weary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4459"/>She finally became so violent and ungovernable, and endangered the household so much in her frantic fits, <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> that even he felt the necessity of placing her under the restraining influences of some public institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4460"/>The Magdalen Asylum at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> consented to receive her, and after much exhortation, she was persuaded to go. While she was there, his daughters in that city called on her occasionally, at his request, and he and his wife made her a visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4461"/>He wrote to her frequently, in the kindest and most encouraging manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4462"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of these epistles, he says: <q direct="unspecified">I make frequent inquiries concerning thee, and am generally told thou art getting along <hi rend="italics">pretty</hi> well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4463"/>Now I want to hear a different tale from that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4464"/>I want thy friends at the <name>Asylum</name> to be able to say, <quote>She is doing <hi rend="italics">exceedingly</hi> well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4465"/>Her health is good, she is satisfied with her condition, and we are all much gratified to find that she submits to the advice of her friends.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4466"/>When they can speak thus of thee, I shall begin to think about changing thy situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4467"/>The woman who fills thy place in my family does very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4468"/>Every day, she puts on the table the mug thou gavest me, and she keeps it as bright as silver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4469"/>Our little garden looks beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4470"/>The Morning Glories, thou used to take so much pleasure in, have grown finely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4471"/>All the family desire kind remembrances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4472"/>Farewell. <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> peace and comfort be with thee.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/></p> 
<p>In another letter, he says: <q direct="unspecified">Thy <name n="God" type="God">Heavenly Father</name> has been kind, and waited long for thee; and He has <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> now provided a way for thy redemption from the bondage under which thou hast suffered so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4474"/>I hope thou wilt not think of leaving the <name>Asylum</name> for some time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4475"/>Thou canst not be so firmly established yet, as not to be under great temptation elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4476"/>What a sorrowful circumstance it would be, if thou shouldst again return to the filthy and wicked habit of stupifying thyself with that pernicious drug!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4477"/>I am glad thou hast determined to take my advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4478"/>If thou wilt do so, I will never forsake thee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4479"/>I will do all I can for thee; and thou shalt never be without a home.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4480"/></p> 
<p>Again he writes: <q direct="unspecified">Thy letter occasioned joy and sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4481"/>Sorrow to find thou hast not always treated the matron as thou oughtest to have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4482"/>I am sure that excellent person is every way worthy of thy regard; and I hope my ears will never again be pained by hearing that thou hast treated her unkindly or disrespectfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4483"/>I did hope that after a year's discipline, thou hadst learned to control thy temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4484"/>Until thou canst do so, thou must be aware that thou art not qualified to render thyself useful or agreeable in any family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4485"/>But after all, I am glad to find that thou art sensible of thy error, and hast a disposition to improve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4486"/>When thou liest down at night, I want thee to examine the deeds of the past day. If thou hast made a hasty reply, or spoken impertinently, or done wrong in any <pb id="p.432" n="432"/> other way, be careful to acknowledge thy fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4487"/>Ask thy <name n="God" type="God">Heavenly Father</name> to forgive thee, and be careful to do so no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4488"/>I feel a great regard for thee; and I trust thou wilt never give me cause to regret thy relapse into vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4489"/>I hope better things for thee, and I always shall.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4490"/></p> 
<p>But his hopefulness and patience proved of no avail in this instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4491"/>The wreck was too complete to admit of repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4492"/>The poor creature occasionally struggled hard to do better; but her constitution was destroyed by vice and hardship; her feelings were blunted by suffering, and her naturally bright faculties were stupified by opium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4493"/>After she left the <name>Asylum</name>, she lived with a family in the country for awhile; but the old habits returned, and destroyed what little strength she had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4494"/>The last I knew of her she was on <placeName reg="Roosevelt Island, New York, New York" key="tgn,2628523">Blackwell's Island</placeName>; and she will probably never leave it, till she goes where the weary are at rest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4495"/>An uncommon degree of interest was excited in Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00432.01285" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>'s mind by the sufferings of another individual, whom I will call <persName n="Peters,,Julia,,," id="n0266.0048.00432.01286" reg="default:Peters,Julia,,,"><foreName>Julia</foreName> <surname>Peters</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4496"/>She was born of respectable parents, and was carefully tended in her early years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4497"/>Her mother was a prudent, religious-minded woman; but she died when <persName n="Julia,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00432.01287" reg="mostcommon:Julia,nomatch:0"><surname>Julia</surname></persName> was <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> old. The father soon after took to drinking and gambling, and spent all the property he possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4498"/>His daughter was thus brought into the <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> midst of profligate associates, at an age when impulses are strong, and the principles unformed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4499"/>She led a vicious life for several years, and during a fit of intoxication married a worthless, dissipated fellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4500"/>When she was <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> old, she was imprisoned for perjury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4501"/>The case appeared doubtful at the time, and from circumstances, which afterward came to light, it is supposed that she was not guilty of the alleged crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4502"/>The jury could not agree on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> trial, and she remained in jail <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, awaiting a decision of her case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4503"/>She was at. last pronounced guilty; and feeling that injustice was done her, she made use of violent and disrespectful language to the court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4504"/>This probably increased the prejudice against her; for she was sentenced to <placeName reg="Sing Sing prison">Sing Sing prison</placeName> for the long term of <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure>. She was naturally intelligent, active and energetic; and the limitations of a prison had a worse effect upon her, than they would have had on a more stolid temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4505"/>In the course of a year or <num value="2">two</num>, her mind began to sink under the pressure, and finally exhibited signs of melancholy insanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4506"/>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00433.01288" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> had an interview with her soon after she was conveyed to <placeName key="tgn,2071503" n="1.000 7" reg="ossining, westchester, new york">Sing Sing</placeName>, and found her in a state of deep dejection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4507"/>She afterward became completely deranged, and was removed to the <rs>Lunatic Asylum</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2068108" n="1.000 1" reg="bloomingdale, essex, new york">Bloomingdale</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4508"/>He and his wife visited her there, and found her in a state of temporary <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> rationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4509"/>Her manners were quiet and pleasing, and she appeared exceedingly gratified to see them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4510"/>The superintendent granted permission to take her with them in a walk through the grounds, and she enjoyed this little excursion very highly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4511"/>But when <num value="1">one</num> of the company remarked that it was a very pleasant place, she sighed deeply, and replied, <q direct="unspecified">Yes, it is a pleasant place to those who can leave it. But chains are chains, though they are made of gold; and mine grow heavier every day.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4512"/></p> 
<p>Her temperament peculiarly required freedom, and chafed and fretted under restraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4513"/>Insanity returned upon her with redoubled force, soon after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4514"/>She used blasphemous and indecent language, and cut up her blankets to make pantaloons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4515"/>She picked the lock of her room, and tried various plans of escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4516"/>When Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00434.01289" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> went to see her again, some weeks later, he found her in the masculine attire, which she had manufactured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4517"/>She tried to hide herself, but when he called her back in a gentle, but firm tone, she came immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4518"/>He took her kindly by the hand, and said, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Julia,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00434.01290" reg="mostcommon:Julia,nomatch:0"><surname>Julia</surname></persName>, what does all this mean?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4519"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">It is military costume,</q> she replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4521"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">I am sorry thou art not more decently clad,</q> said he. <q direct="unspecified">I intended to have thee take a walk with me; but I should be ashamed to go with thee in <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> that condition.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>She earnestly entreated to go, and promised to change her dress immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/>He accordingly waited till she was ready, and then spent more than an hour walking round the grounds with her. She told him the history of her life, and wept bitterly over the retrospect of her erroneous course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4524"/>It seemed a great relief to have some <num value="1">one</num> to whom she could open her over-burdened heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4525"/>She was occasionally incoherent, but the fresh air invigorated her, and the quiet talk soothed her perturbed feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4526"/>At parting, she said, <q direct="unspecified">I thank you. I thought I hadn't a friend in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4527"/>I was afraid everybody had forgotten me.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/></p> 
<p>I make the following extract from a letter, which he wrote to her soon after: <q direct="unspecified">Now, <persName n="Julia,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00435.01291" reg="mostcommon:Julia,nomatch:0"><surname>Julia</surname></persName>, listen to me, and mind what I say; for thou knowest I am thy friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4532"/>It would grieve me, and I am sure thou dost not wish to do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4541"/>Her bodily and mental health continued to improve; and in the course of <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, the doctor allowed her to accompany her kind old friend to the city, and spend a day and night at his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>This change of scene was found so beneficial, that the visit was repeated a few weeks after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>Before winter set in, she was so far restored that she spent several days in his family, and conducted with the greatest propriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4544"/>He soon after applied to the <rs>Governor</rs> for a pardon, which was promptly granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/>His next step was to procure a suitable home for her; and a worthy <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> family in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, who were acquainted with all the circumstances, agreed to employ her as chambermaid and seamstress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>I had seen this young and comely looking woman, who was endowed with more than common good sense, driven to the depths of despair by the intensity of her sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>I had seen her a raving maniac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/>Now, I saw her <quote>sitting and clothed in her right mind.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>I was a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times more than compensated for all the pains I had taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/></p> 
<p>As her nerves were in a very excitable state, it was thought best that she should remain a few weeks under the superintendence of his daughter, <persName n="Gibbons,Mrs.,,,," id="n0266.0048.00437.01296" reg="nearbymention:Gibbons,James,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Gibbons</surname></persName>, before she went to the home provided for her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>Having earned a little money by her needle, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> use she made of it, <pb id="p.438" n="438"/> was to buy a pair of vases for Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00438.01297" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>; and proud and pleased she was, when she brought them home and presented them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4564"/>He always kept them on the parlor mantel-piece, and often told their history to people who called upon him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4565"/>When she had become perfectly calm and settled, he and his wife accompanied her to <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and saw her established among her new friends, who received her in the kindest manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4566"/>A week after his return, he wrote to assure her that his interest in her had not abated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4567"/>In the course of the letter, he says: <q direct="unspecified">I need not tell thee how anxious I am that thou shouldst conduct so as to be a credit to thyself, and to those who have interested themselves in thy behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4568"/>I felt keenly at parting with thee, but I was comforted by the reflection that I had left thee with kind friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4569"/>Confide in them upon all occasions, and do nothing without their advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4570"/>Thy future happiness will depend very much upon thyself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4571"/>Never suffer thy mind to become excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4572"/>Remember that kind friends were raised up for thee in the midst of all thy sorrows, and that they will always continue to be thy friends, if thou wilt be guided by their counsels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4573"/>Thou wert with us so long, that we feel toward thee like <num value="1">one</num> of the family.

<p>For a few months, she behaved in a very satisfactory manner, though occasionally unsettled and depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4584"/>She wrote that the worthy woman with whom she lived was <quote>both mother and friend to her.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4585"/>But the country was gloomy in the winter, and the spirit of unrest took possession of her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4586"/>I have seldom seen Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00439.01299" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> so deeply pained as he was by this retrograde step in <num value="1">one</num> whom he had rejoiced over, <q direct="unspecified">as a brand plucked from the burning.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4587"/>After awhile, he addressed a letter to her, in which he says: <q direct="unspecified">I should have written to thee before, but I have been at a loss what to say. I have cared for thee, as if thou hadst been my own child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4588"/>Little did I think thou wouldst <pb id="p.440" n="440"/> ever disgrace thyself, and distress me, by associating with the most vile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4600"/>Thou mayest yet be happy thyself, and make those happy who have taken a deep interest in thy welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4601"/>But if thou art determined to pursue evil courses, after all that has been done for thee, let me tell thee thy days will be brief and full of trouble; and I doubt not thou wilt end them within the walls of a prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4602"/>I hope better things of thee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4603"/>If thou doest well, it will afford encouragement to assist others; but if thy conduct is bad, it may be the means of prolonging the sufferings of many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4604"/>I am still thy friend, and disposed to do all I can for thee.</q>

<p>In her answer, she says: <q direct="unspecified">Oh, frail woman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4606"/>No <pb id="p.441" n="441"/> steps can be recalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4607"/>It is all in the future to make amends for the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4608"/>After all the good counsel some receive, they return to habits of vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4609"/>They repent when it is too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4610"/>How true it is that virtue has its reward, and vice its punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4611"/>I know that the way of transgressors is hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4612"/>If I only had a few years of my life to live over again, how different would I live!

<p>He wrote thus to her, a short time after: <q direct="unspecified">I very often think of thee, and I yet hope that I shall <num value="1">one</num> day see thee a happy and respectable woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4617"/>I have lately had a good deal of conversation with the <rs>Governor</rs> concerning <quote>my friends,</quote> as he calls those whom he has pardoned at my request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>I remembered how I used to walk with thee about the grounds; and my mind was for a time depressed with melancholy reflections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>I earnestly advise thee to guard well thy thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>Never allow thyself to use an immodest word, or to be guilty of an unbecoming action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>She makes a very respectable appearance, is modest and discreet in her deportment, and industrious in her habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>As a mark of gratitude for the attentions, which at different times I have extended to her, she has sent me a pair of handsome gloves, and a bandana handkerchief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>Taking into consideration all the circumstances attending this case, this small present affords me much more gratification than <num value="10">ten</num> times the value from any other person.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/></p> 
<p>Many more instances might be quoted; but enough has been told to illustrate his patience and forbearance, and his judicious mode of dealing with such characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>The fullness of his sympathy was probably <num value="1">one</num> great reason why he obtained such influence over them, and made them so willing to open their hearts to him. He naturally, and without effort, put <hi rend="italics">his</hi> soul in <hi rend="italics">their</hi> soul's stead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/>This rendered it easy for him to disregard his own interests, and set aside his own opinions, for the benefit of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4638"/>In several instances, he procured another place for a healthy, good-looking domestic, with whose services he was well satisfied, merely because some poor creature applied for work, who was too lame, or ill-favored, to obtain employment elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4639"/>When an insane girl, from <placeName key="tgn,2071503" n="1.000 7" reg="ossining, westchester, new york">Sing Sing</placeName>, was brought to his house to wait for an opportunity to return to her parents in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, he sent for the <rs>Catholic Bishop</rs> to <pb id="p.444" n="444"/> come and minister to her spiritual wants, because he found she was very unhappy without religious consolation in the form to which she had been accustomed in childhood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/>The peculiar adaptation of his character to this mission of humanity was not only felt by his fellow laborers in the <rs>New-York Association</rs>, but was acknowledged wherever he was known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4651"/>A great many people, if they happened <pb id="p.445" n="445"/> to have their feelings touched by some scene of distress, seemed to think they had fulfilled their whole duty by sending the sufferer to <persName n="Hopper,,Isaac,T.,," id="n0266.0048.00445.01305" reg="expanded:Hopper,Isaac,Tatem,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/>Few can imagine what an arduous task it is to be such a thorough philanthropist as he was. Whoever wishes for a crown like his, must earn it by carrying the martyr's cross through life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>Of course, he did not endorse everything that was said and done by all sorts of temperaments engaged in that cause, or in any other cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="She's Colored">She's colored</orgName>,</q> was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/><q direct="unspecified">It disturbs my conscience to ride in a public conveyance, where any decently behaved person is refused admittance.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>And though it was raining very fast, and his home was a mile off, the old veteran of <measure n="75years" type="date">seventy-five years</measure> marched through mud and wet, at a pace somewhat brisker than his usual energetic step; for indignation warmed his honest and kindly heart, and set the blood in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>The next day, he called at the rail-road office, and very civilly inquired of <num value="1">one</num> of the managers whether conductors were instructed to exclude passengers merely on account of complexion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/><q direct="unspecified">Certainly not,</q> was the prompt reply.

<p>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00449.01320" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> then related how a young woman of modest appearance, and respectable dress, was <pb id="p.450" n="450"/> pushed from the step, though the car was nearly empty, and she was seeking shelter from a violent rain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/><q direct="unspecified">That was wrong,</q> replied the manager.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/><q direct="unspecified">We have no reason to complain of colored people as passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>They obtrude upon no <num value="1">one</num>, and always have sixpences in readiness to pay; whereas fashionably dressed white people frequently offer a <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollar</measure> bill, which they know we cannot change, and thus cheat us out of our rightful dues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>Who was the conductor, that behaved in the manner you have described?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/></p> 
<p>Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00450.01321" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName> replied, <q direct="unspecified">I had rather thou wouldst not turn him out of thy employ, unless he repeats the offence, after being properly instructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>I have no wish to injure the man. He has become infected with the unjust prejudices of the community without duly reflecting upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>Friendly conversation with him may suggest wiser thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>They parted mutually well pleased; and a few days after, <pb id="p.451" n="451"/> the same conductor admitted a colored woman into the cars without making any objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>This improved state of things continued several weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>But the old tyrannical system was restored, owing to counteracting influence from some unknown quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>I often met colored people coming from the country in the <rs>Harlem</rs> cars; but I never afterward knew <num value="1">one</num> to enter from the streets of the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>Many colored people die every year, and vast numbers have their health permanently impaired, on account of inclement weather, to which they are exposed by exclusion from public conveyances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>And this merely on account of complexion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>Yet the great heart of the people is moved by kind and sincere feelings in its outbursts against foreign tyranny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>But in addition to this honorable sympathy for the oppressed in other countries, it would be well for them to look at home, and consider whether it is just that any well-behaved people should be excluded from the common privileges of public conveyances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>It is the almost universal failure in individual duty, which so accumulates errors and iniquities in society, that the ultratheories, and extra efforts of reformers become absolutely <pb id="p.452" n="452"/> necessary to prevent the balance of things from being destroyed; as thunder and lightning are required to purify a polluted atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>It is because the majority of men, who see that things are not altogether right, yet see in so frigid a way, and have so little courage to express their views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>Being introduced as a zealous abolitionist, the conversation immediately turned upon slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/><num value="1">One</num> of the preacher's daughters said, <q direct="unspecified">I could'nt possibly get along without slaves, <persName n="Hopper,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00452.01325" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>Why I never dressed or undressed myself, till I came to the <rs>North</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4722"/><q direct="unspecified">And what would you have done, if you had seen her?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>she inquired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4724"/>He replied, <q direct="unspecified">I would have told her that she was a free woman while she remained here; but if she <pb id="p.453" n="453"/> went back to the <rs>South</rs>, she would be liable to be sold, like a pig or a sheep.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4725"/></p> 
<p>They laughed at this frank avowal, and when he invited them to come to his house with their father, to take tea, they gladly accepted the invitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>Again the conversation turned toward that subject, which is never forgotten when <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4727"/>In answer to some remark from Friend <persName n="Hopper,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00453.01327" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><surname>Hopper</surname></persName>, the preacher said, <q direct="unspecified">Do you think I am not a Christian?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4728"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">I certainly do not regard thee as <num value="1">one</num>,</q> he replied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/><q direct="unspecified">And I suppose you think I cannot get to heaven?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4730"/>rejoined the slaveholder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4731"/><q direct="unspecified">I will not say that,</q> replied the <name>Friend</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4732"/><q direct="unspecified">To thy own Master thou must stand or fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4733"/>But slavery is a great abomination, and no <num value="1">one</num> who is guilty of it can be a Christian, or Christ-like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4734"/>I would not exclude thee from the kingdom of heaven; but if thou dost enter there, it must be because thou art ignorant of the fact that thou art living in sin.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4735"/></p> 
<p>After a prolonged conversation, mostly on the same topic, the guests rose to depart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4736"/>The Methodist said, <q direct="unspecified">Well, <persName n="Hopper,Mister,,,," id="n0266.0048.00453.01328" reg="nearbymention:Hopper,Isaac,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hopper</surname></persName>, I have never been treated better by any man, than I have been by you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4737"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Ah! and thou wouldst lynch me; or at least, thy friends would,</q> he replied, smiling.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4738"/><q direct="unspecified">Oh no, we would treat you very well,</q> rejoined <pb id="p.454" n="454"/> the <rs>Southerner</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4739"/><q direct="unspecified">But how would you talk about slavery if you were there?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4740"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Just as I do here, to be sure,</q> answered the <rs>Quaker</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4741"/><q direct="unspecified">I would advise the slaves to be honest, industrious, and obedient, and never try to run away from a good master, unless they were pretty sure of escaping; because if they were caught, they would fare worse than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4742"/>But if they had a safe opportunity, I should advise them to be off as soon as possible.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4743"/>In a more serious tone, he added, <q direct="unspecified">And to thee, who claimest to be a minister of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00454.01329" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, I would say that thy Master requires thee to give deliverance to the captive, and let the oppressed go free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4744"/>My friend, hast thou a conscience void of offence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4745"/>When thou liest down at night, is thy mind always at ease on this subject?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4746"/>After pouring out thy soul in prayer to thy <name n="God" type="God">Heavenly Father</name>, dost thou not feel the outraged sense of right, like a perpetual motion, restless within thy breast?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4748"/></p> 
<p>The preacher manifested some emotion at this earnest appeal, and confessed that he sometimes had doubts on the subject; though, on the whole, he had concluded that it was right to hold slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4749"/><num value="1">One</num> of his daughters, who was a widow, seemed to be more deeply touched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/>When he talked to her, she would make her little fingers fly, in the prettiest fashion, interpreting by signs to her mute mother all that <q direct="unspecified">Opper</q> had been saying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4799"/>Her quick intelligence and animated gestures were a perpetual source of amusement to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>My bodily indisposition has prevented an earlier acknowledgment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>The kind, friendly, and affectionate manner in which you have been pleased to express yourselves on this occasion, excited emotions which I found it difficult to repress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>The approbation of those with whom I have long labored in a deeply interesting and arduous concern, I value next to the testimony of a good conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>Multiplied years and debility of body admonish me to retire from active life as much as may be, but my interest in the work has not abated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>Much has been done, and much remains to be done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>In taking a retrospect of my intercourse with you, I am rejoiced to see that the great principles of humanity and <name>Christian</name> benevolence have risen above and overspread sectarian prejudice, that bane of Christianity, and while each has been allowed to enjoy his own religious opinions without interference from his fellows, we have labored harmoniously together for the promotion of the great object of our Association.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>May He who clothes the lilies, feeds the ravens, and <pb id="p.473" n="473"/> provides for the sparrows, and without whose Providential regard, all our endeavors must be vain, bless your labors, and stimulate and encourage you to persevere, so that having, through His aid, fulfilled all your relative and social duties, you may in the end receive the welcome, <q direct="unspecified">Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>Early in the <rs type="place">Spring</rs>, he was conveyed to the house of his daughter, <persName n="Gibbons,Mrs.,,,," id="n0266.0048.00473.01360" reg="mostcommon:Gibbons,James,S.,,:9"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Gibbons</surname></persName>, in the upper part of the city; it being supposed that change of air and scene might prove beneficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>It was afterward deemed imprudent to remove him. His illness was attended with a good deal of physical suffering; but he was uniformly patient and cheerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>He often observed, <q direct="unspecified">There is no cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>There is nothing in my way. Nothing troubles me.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>His daughters left all other duties, and devoted themselves exclusively to him. Never were the declining hours of an old man watched over with more devoted affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>Writing to his daughter <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, he <pb id="p.474" n="474"/> says: <q direct="unspecified">I have the best nurses in <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>, thy mother and sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>I have every comfort that industry and ingenuity can supply.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/></p> 
<p>Among the <name>Quakers</name> who manifested kindness and sympathy, several belonged to the branch called Orthodox; for a sincere respect and friendship had grown up between him and individuals of that Society, in <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New-York</placeName>, after the dust of controversy had subsided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/>He was always glad to see them; for his heart warmed toward the plain dress and the plain language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>But I think nothing during his illness gave him more unalloyed satisfaction than a visit from <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Wharton,,Deborah,,," id="n0266.0048.00474.01361" reg="default:Wharton,Deborah,,,"><foreName>Deborah</foreName> <surname>Wharton</surname></persName>, Friends from <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>He loved this worthy couple for their truly <name>Christian</name> character; and they were, moreover, endeared to him by many tender and pleasant associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>They stood by him generously during his severe pecuniary struggles; they had been devoted to his beloved <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>, whose long illness was cheered by their unremitting attentions, and she, for many years, had received from <persName n="Fisher,,Hannah,,," id="n0266.0048.00474.01362" reg="default:Fisher,Hannah,,,"><foreName>Hannah</foreName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName>, <persName n="Deborah,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00474.01363" reg="mostcommon:Deborah,nomatch:0"><surname>Deborah</surname></persName>'s mother, the most uniform kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/><persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName>'s father, a wealthy merchant, had been to him an early and constant friend; and his uncle, the excellent mayor of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, had sustained him by his influence and hearty co-operation, in many a fugitive slave case, that occurred in years long past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>It was, therefore, altogether pleasant to <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> clasp hands with these tried and trusty friends, before life and all its reminiscences faded away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>His physician, <persName n="Beales,Doctor,John,C.,," id="n0266.0048.00475.01364" reg="default:Beales,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Beales</surname></persName>, was very assiduous in his attentions, and his visits were always interesting to the invalid, who generally made them an occasion for pleasant and animated conversation; often leading the doctor off the professional track, by some playful account of his symptoms, however painful they might be. He had been his medical adviser for many years, and as a mark of respect for his disinterested services to his fellow-men, he uniformly declined to receive any compensation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>Neighbors and acquaintances of recent date, likewise manifested their respect for the invalid by all manner of attentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>Gentlemen sent choice wines, and ladies offered fruit and flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>Market people, who knew him in the way of business, brought delicacies of various kinds for his acceptance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>He was gratified by such tokens of regard, and manifested it in many pleasant little ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/><num value="1">One</num> of his sons had presented him a silver goblet, with the word <q direct="unspecified">Father</q> inscribed upon it; and whenever he was about to take nourishment, he would say, <q direct="unspecified">Give it to me in <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>'s cup.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>When his little grand-daughter brought flowers from the garden, he was careful to have them placed by the bedside, where he could see them continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>After he was unable to rise to take his meals, he asked to have <num value="2">two</num> cups and plates <pb id="p.476" n="476"/> brought to him, if it were not too much trouble; for he said it would seem pleasant, and like old times, to have <orgName n="company"><persName n="Hannah,,,,," id="n0266.0048.00476.01365" reg="mostcommon:Hannah,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannah</surname></persName>'s company</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>So his wife ate with him, as long as he was able to partake of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>A china bird, which a ransomed slave had given to his daughter, when she was a little girl, was placed on the mantel-piece, because he liked to look at it. A visitor, to whom he made this remark <num value="1">one</num> day, replied, <q direct="unspecified">It must be very pleasant to you now to remember how many unfortunate beings you have helped.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>He looked up, and answered with frank simplicity, <q direct="unspecified">Yes, it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> pleasant.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/></p> 
<p>He made continual efforts to conceal that he was in pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>When they asked why he was so often singing to himself, he replied, <q direct="unspecified">If I didn't sing, I should groan.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>Even as late as the day before he died, he indulged in some little <q direct="unspecified">Cheeryble</q> pleasantries, evidently intended to enliven those who were nearly exhausted by their long attendance on him. At this period, his son-in-law, <persName n="Gibbons,,James,S.,," id="n0266.0048.00476.01366" reg="default:Gibbons,James,S.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Gibbons</surname></persName>, wrote to me thus: <q direct="unspecified">Considering his long bodily weakness, now <measure n="10weeks" type="date">ten weeks</measure>, he is in an extraordinary state of mental strength and clearness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>Reminiscences are continually falling from his lips, like leaves in autumn from an old forest tree; not indeed green, but rich in the colors that are of the tree, and characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>Thou hast known him in the extraordinary vigor and freshness of his old age; cheating <pb id="p.477" n="477"/> time even out of turning his hair gray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>But thou shouldst see him now; when, to use his own words, he feels that <quote>the messenger has come.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>All his thoughts have tended to, and reached this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>The only question with him now is of a few more days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>Though prostrate in body, his mind is like a sturdy old oak, that don't care which way the wind blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>As I sat by his bedside, last evening, I thought I never had seen so beautiful a close to a good man's life.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/></p> 
<p>He had no need to make a will; for he died, as he had lived, without property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>But he disposed of his little keepsakes with as much cheerfulness as if he had been making New-Year's presents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>He seemed to remember everybody in the distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>His <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> library was left in the care of his children, with directions that it should be kept where members of the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName> or others interested could have ready access to it. To his daughter <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName> he entrusted the paper written by her mother, at <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> of age; still fastened by the pin she had placed in it, which her dear hand had invested with more value than a diamond, in his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>He earnestly recommended his wife to the affectionate care of his children; reminding them that she had been a kind and faithful companion to him during many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>He also gave general directions concerning his funeral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/><q direct="unspecified">Don't take the trouble to <pb id="p.478" n="478"/> make a shroud,</q> said he. <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">One</num> of my night-shirts will do as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>I should prefer to be buried in a <rs n="white pine" type="product">white pine</rs> coffin; but that might be painful to my family; and I should not like to afflict them in <hi rend="italics">any</hi> way. It may, therefore, be of dark wood; but be sure to have it entirely plain, without varnish or inscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>Have it made by some poor neighbor, and pay him the usual price of a handsome <num value="1">one</num>; for I merely wish to leave a testimony against vain show on such occasions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>He appeared to be rather indifferent where he was buried; but when he was informed that his son and daughter had purchased a lot at <placeName reg="Greenwood Cemetery">Greenwood Cemetery</placeName>, it seemed pleasant to him to think of having them and their families gathered round him, and he consented to be laid there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>I was summoned to his death-bed, and arrived <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before his departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>I found his mind perfectly bright and clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>He told over again some of his old reminiscences, and indulged in a few of his customary pleasantries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>He spoke of rejoining his beloved <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>, and his ancient friends <persName n="Savery,,William,,," id="n0266.0048.00478.01367" reg="default:Savery,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Savery</surname></persName>, <persName n="Waln,,Nicholas,,," id="n0266.0048.00478.01368" reg="default:Waln,Nicholas,,,"><foreName>Nicholas</foreName> <surname>Waln</surname></persName>, <persName n="Scattergood,,Thomas,,," id="n0266.0048.00478.01369" reg="default:Scattergood,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Scattergood</surname></persName>, and others, with as much certainty and pleasure as if he had been anticipating a visit to <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4982"/>Sometimes, when he was much exhausted with physical pain, he would sigh forth, <q direct="unspecified">Oh, for rest in the kingdom of heaven!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>But nothing that approached nearer to complaint or impatience escaped his lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4984"/><pb id="p.479" n="479"/> On the last day, he repeated to me, what he had previously said to others, that he sometimes seemed to hear voices singing, <q direct="unspecified">We have come to take thee home.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4985"/>Once, when no <num value="1">one</num> else happened to be near him, he said to me in a low, confidential tone, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Maria</foreName></persName>, is there anything peculiar in this room?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4986"/>I replied, <q direct="unspecified">No.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4987"/>Why do you ask that question?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/><q direct="unspecified">Because,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">you all look so beautiful; and the covering on the bed has such glorious colors, as I never saw. But perhaps I had better not have said anything about it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/>The natural world was transfigured to his dying senses; perhaps by an influx of light from the spiritual; and I suppose he thought I should understand it as a sign that the time of his departure drew nigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>It was a scene to remind <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Taylor,,Jeremy,,," id="n0266.0048.00479.01370" reg="default:Taylor,Jeremy,,,"><foreName>Jeremy</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s eloquent words: <q direct="unspecified">When a good man dies, <num value="1">one</num> that hath lived innocently, then the joys break forth through the clouds of sickness, and the conscience stands upright, and confesses the glories of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>: and owns so much integrity, that it can hope for pardon, and obtain it too. Then the sorrows of sickness do but untie the soul from its chain, and let it go forth, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> into liberty, and then into glory.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4991"/></p> 
<p>A few hours before he breathed his last, he rallied from a state of drowsiness, and asked for a box containing his private papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>He wished to find <num value="1">one</num>, which he thought ought to be destroyed, lest it should do some injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>He put on his spectacles, and looked <pb id="p.480" n="480"/> at the papers which were handed him; but the old man's eyes were dimmed with death, and he could not see the writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>After <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> feeble and ineffectual attempts, he took off his spectacles, with a trembling hand, and gave them to his beloved daughter, <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>, saying, <q direct="unspecified">Take them, my child, and keep them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>They were thy dear mother's. I can never use them more.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>The scene was inexpressibly affecting; and we all wept to see this untiring friend of mankind compelled at last to acknowledge that he could work no longer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>Of his <num value="16">sixteen</num> children, <num value="10">ten</num> were living; and all but <num value="2">two</num> of them were able to be with him in these last days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>He addressed affectionate exhortations to them at various times; and a few hours before he died, he called them, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, to his bedside, to receive his farewell benediction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>At last, he whispered my name; and as I knelt to kiss his hand, he said in broken accents, and at long intervals, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Maria</foreName></persName>, tell them I loved them&mdash;&mdash;though I felt called to resist&mdash;&mdash;some who claimed to be rulers in <placeName key="tgn,1000119" n="1.000 3" reg="yisra'el">Israel</placeName> &mdash;&mdash;I never meant&mdash;&mdash;.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5000"/>His strength was nearly exhausted; but after a pause, he pressed my hand, and added, <q direct="unspecified">Tell them I love them <hi rend="italics">all</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>I had previously asked and obtained permission to write his biography; and from these broken sentences, I understood that he wished me to convey in it a message to the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>; including the <q direct="unspecified">Orthodox</q> <pb id="p.481" n="481"/> branch, with whom he had been brought into painful collision, in years gone by.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5002"/>After several hours of restlessness and suffering, he fell into a tranquil slumber, which lasted a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5003"/>The serene expression of his countenance remained unchanged, and there was no motion of limb or muscle, when the spirit passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5004"/>This was between <time value="8">eight</time> and <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> in the evening, on the <dateStruct value="1852-05-7"><day reg="7">seventh</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5005"/>After a long interval of silent weeping, his widow laid her head on the shoulder of <num value="1">one</num> of his sons, and said, <q direct="unspecified"><measure n="47years" type="date">Forty-seven years</measure> ago this very day, my good father died; and from that day to this, he has been the best friend I ever had.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5006"/></p> 
<p>No public buildings were hung with crape, when news went forth that the <rs>Good Samaritan</rs> had gone.
